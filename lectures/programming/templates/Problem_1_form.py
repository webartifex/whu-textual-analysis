# Programming Problem 1
###################################

# Task 1: open the file 'Fun_with_Python.txt' in Spyder and print its content
# The file can be found in our data folder

# get the text from the file
input_text= TO BE COMPLETED
# print the content, i.e., the text of the file (previous line)
print(TO BE COMPLETED)

# See slide 7


# Task 2: Write the content of 'Fun_with_Python.txt' to a new text file
# with the name 'More_fun_with_Python.txt'.

# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS HERE
# See slide 8.
# REMEMBER to close your file. If you do not close the new txt file, its content
# will not be saved to the hard drive. You will find an empty txt in your file manager.


# Task 3: Write a loop that prints some text (whatever you like) ten times.

# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS HERE
# See slide 9.
# You have several options. While loop, for X in range() loop, etc.



# Task 4: Print the text of the "Fun_with_Python" file line by line!

# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS HERE
# See slide 10.
# You need a loop (Task 3) and in each iteration of the loop have Python print
# a line of text.



# Task 5: Count how often the word 'good' appears in the document 'Fun_with_Python.txt'!

# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS HERE
# See slide 11.



# Task 6a: Now, print only the lines that contain the word 'good'!

# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS HERE
# See also slide 12.
# You can use the line-by-line printing from Task 4 and combine it with the command ".count()" from Task 5
# and add the if condition from slide 12.
# If condition: for each line check whether the specific line contains the word "good".



# Task 7: print only the lines that start with the word 'This'!

# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS HERE
# See slide 15.
# This is very similar to task 6. You only need to modify the if condition a bit.




# Task 8a: Replace the word "good" by "excellent" and display the new text!
# See slide 16.
# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS HERE
