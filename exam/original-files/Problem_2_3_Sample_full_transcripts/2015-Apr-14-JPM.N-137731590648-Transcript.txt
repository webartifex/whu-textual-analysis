Presentation

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter 2015 earnings call. This call is being recorded.
(Operator Instructions)
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website.
Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
So starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $5.9 billion for the quarter and EPS of $1.45 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 14%. On revenue of nearly $25 billion, up 4% year on year reflecting strong performance. The quarter was characterized by a constructive environment supporting broad strength in underlying performance.
We saw higher levels of volatility and client activity on the back of a number of macro events driving higher markets revenues. We also saw strength across IBCs and core loan growth was strong up 10% year on year.
Included in the results was firm-wide legal expense of approximately $500 million after-tax. Outside of legal other small and notable items on a net basis did not contribute significantly to the result which means that a more core earnings number would have been well the other side of $6 billion. Adjusted expense which excludes legal was $14.2 billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter with an adjusted overhead ratio of 57%.
And outside of a modest reserve bill for oil and gas which I will come back to credit trends remained benign and firm-wide net charge-offs remained low at $1.1 billion. We continued to make progress against our capital targets reaching a fully phased in CET1 ratio of 10.6% while returning over $3 billion to shareholders in the quarter. Finally we're pleased that we did not receive an objection to our capital plan and the Board announced its intention to increase the quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.44 a share and authorized gross share repurchases of $6.4 billion.
Before I move on you will notice we streamlined our earnings press release for the quarter, simplified the format and focused in on key messages.
Skipping over page 2, turning to page 3 and our balance sheet. As I said the firm's fully phased in CET1 ratio advanced with 10.6% up about 45 basis points quarter on quarter with earnings, model benefit and the combined impact of portfolio runoff and other RWA reductions being offset by capital distributions. The fully phased in standardized CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up from 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014.
While we made very good progress during the first quarter the pace of capital accretion during the year won't be linear particularly given the timing of model benefit. We continue to expect our ratio to be 11% plus or minus at the end of this year. The firm and the bank SLR improved slightly from last quarter at 5.7% and 6% respectively.
On the next page on page 4, we've added a new page on our balance sheet given the objectives we outlined at Investor Day on nonoperating deposits. So turn to page 4. As you look at the balance sheet it's important to look both on an average and on a spot basis.
If you look on the left our average balance sheet is higher by $46 billion which reflects a significant ramp up in deposits in the fourth quarter. But if you look next to that you can see on a spot basis that March is actually relatively flat to December. And if you move to the right end of the period deposits are also flat quarter on quarter but with a relatively significant mix shift towards retail deposits.
With other deposits down $24 billion predominantly driven by client actions related to nonoperating deposits reflecting good progress towards our goal in what has effectively been a matter of weeks since Investor Day. We're actively engaged with our clients and working with them to implement plans to further reduce these deposits and we expect the second quarter to be meaningful in this context. We're still committed to our goal of reducing them by up to $100 billion by the end of the year.
Moving on to NIM and NII it's the higher average cash balances on deposit growth as well as some asset reductions that drove the 7 basis point compression in NIM. And in terms of NII day count was a large driver of the decline.
Turning to page 5 and Consumer & Community Banking, the combined Consumer businesses generated $2.2 billion of net income for the quarter and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $10.7 billion was up 2% year on year driven by healthy growth in balances and in noninterest revenue partially offset by spread compression. Revenue declined 2% sequentially reported or 4% if you were to exclude the loss in the fourth quarter associated with portfolio exits in Card.
And this decline is driven by seasonality in NIR as well as fewer days in the quarter. We remain focused on the customer experience and on our strong customer satisfaction rankings and we continue to grow households and see very low levels of attrition. And we're deepening relationships.
Our average deposits are now over $0.5 trillion, up 9% year on year. We have record client investment assets up 12%. Our active mobile customer base is a 22%, Card sales volume up 8% and our overall loan book grew for the third consecutive quarter with core loan growth of 15% year on year.
And across CCB we remain disciplined on expense management. Year-on-year expenses were lower by nearly $250 million and our headcount is down about 1,900 so far this year.
You will recall that at Investor Day we committed to reduce expenses by about $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014. And while it will not be exactly linear you should assume a meaningful down payment towards that $2 billion in 2015.
Moving to page 6 Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $828 million for the quarter up 10% year on year and with an ROE of 28%.
We continue to see robust performance across our drivers. Average deposit balance growth was up 9%, up $39 billion from last year and in Business Banking the momentum we saw in 2014 carried over into 2015 and supported loan originations of $1.5 billion, up 2% year on year but with average loan balances up 6% also driven by higher utilization rates.
These underlying drivers helped offset the impact of the low rate environment. NII was down 5% quarter over quarter in line with our guidance on lower deposit margin which was down 12 basis points driven by lower reinvestment rates as well as day count.
NIR while down seasonally quarter on quarter was up 5% year on year due to strong client investment and debit revenues. Expenses were down 3% year on year reflecting continued improvement in branch efficiency.
Mortgage Banking on page 7, you'll notice we simplified the reporting for Mortgage Banking here; it's now consistent with the other CCB lines of business. But the additional detail by sub line of business is still available in our earnings supplement.
So overall net income was $326 million for the quarter, originations were strong at $25 billion up 7% quarter over quarter as we maintain share in a larger market and realized higher revenue margins. And we added $15 billion of high-quality loans in the quarter to our balance sheet driving slightly higher NII quarter on quarter despite fewer days.
Although production was higher our total revenue declined quarter over quarter on lower repurchase benefits and lower servicing revenue. Expense of $1.2 billion was down 6% quarter over quarter and down 13% year on year but excluding legal would have been down 19% year on year, over $0.25 billion despite higher volumes as we continue to tightly control our costs.
On credit we continued to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and released $100 million of NCI reserves this quarter. And you can see the net charge-off rate at 30 basis points was down 25 basis points year on year.
Moving on to Card, Commerce Solutions & Auto net income of $1.1 billion down 3% year on year with an ROE of 22% but excluding reserve releases net income was up 11%. In the quarter we moved our commercial card loans to the CIB to align with the client relationships. This was a $1.3 billion reduction in Card loan balances and relatively modest impact of less than $50 million on each of revenue and expense.
Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year on year with the Card revenue rate of 12.2% in line with guidance. On solid sales growth and reflecting continued investment in acquisitions.
And in Auto we saw solid loan and lease growth partially offset by spread compression. Expense was up 2% year on year predominantly driven by higher auto lease depreciation. In Card we saw end-of-period loan growth of $3 billion excluding the commercial card transfer I just mentioned and we saw sales growth of 8%.
This sales growth is lower than recent growth rates which have typically been in the double digits reflecting the impact of lower gas prices estimated to be about 200 basis points as well as a generally competitive environment. In Commerce Solutions we're gaining share; volume was up 13% year on year, driven by continued strong spend as well as the addition of new merchants. And in Auto results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used-car values.
It was the 14th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 6% year on year. Year to date the pipeline remains healthy reflecting continued strength in the market as well as the strength of our manufacturing partners. Finally on credit, card delinquency rates and net charge-offs remained low.
On page 9 the Corporate & Investment Bank, CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.6 billion and an ROE of 16%. Revenue was up 8% year on year as market conditions in the quarter benefited both investment banking and markets and our businesses performed well.
In banking our IB fees of $1.8 billion were up 22% year on year. We continue to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.6% share up 100 basis points since last year.
Advisory fees were up 42% which was a strong start for both JPMorgan as well as the market with some large transactions. In fact this was our highest first quarter on record and we saw share gains of 150 basis points.
Debt underwriting fees were up 16% driven by acquisition financing. Aside from that debt issuance was generally lower and equity underwriting fees were up 13% in a market that was up only 4%. Our wallet rank improved to number one both globally and in the US.
Looking forward for IB fees we had some notable large transactions in the first quarter and so we do expect the second quarter to be lower although our pipeline remains strong. Treasury services revenue of $1 billion was down 2% year on year mainly driven by lower deposit NII and lower trade finance revenue. And lending revenue was $353 million, up 9% given dividends on restructured securities.
Moving on to markets revenue of $5.7 billion it was up 9% year on year but if you exclude business simplification both total markets as well as fixed income markets would have been up 20%. A number of macro events occurred in the quarter including Central Bank actions, the Swiss franc decoupling, a stronger dollar and oil price volatility which supported markets performance broadly in currencies, emerging markets, rates, commodities and equities. In fact equities had one of its strongest quarters up 22% with strength in derivatives and cash in particular across the US and Asia.
The first half of the quarter was particularly strong. The market has absorbed a number of the macro events at this point and recent sentiment is that the Fed will act later rather than sooner this year. As a result while we are still seeing good client flow and volatility does remain elevated it is somewhat lower coming into the second quarter.
With respect to business simplification in the second quarter it will happen overall neutral impact to our P&L but will have or drive a $300 million decline year on year in revenue with a $300 million offset in lower expenses. Security services revenue $934 million was down 9% year on year driven by two factors.
First the impact of change in presentation for client revenue sharing agreements in our ADR issuance business. Effective this quarter these past few payments to clients will be treated as a reduction of revenue having formerly been treated as an expense but with no P&L impact.
Second at the end of the fourth quarter of last year there was a significant client exit and the revenue impact of this is reflected in this quarter's results. So for the remainder of 2015 given those two facts we expect security services revenue to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion a quarter depending on seasonality.
Lastly on expense total expense was $5.7 billion up 1% year on year with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter flat year on year and an overhead ratio of $0.59. Non-compensation expense declined due to business simplification partially offset by higher legal expense year on year.
Moving on to page 10 and the Commercial Bank, it was a strong quarter with respect to the underlying fundamentals in this business, another record quarter for investment banking revenue with gross revenues of over $750 million. In absolute dollars it was our strongest quarter ever for loan growth adding over $5 billion in loans across C&I and CRE and revolver utilization was at its highest level since 2009. Credit quality remained exceptional with continued loan net charge-offs of only 3 basis points.
So overall financial performance for the quarter was solid. Net income was $600 million on $1.7 billion of revenue and an ROE of 17%. Revenue increased 4% year on year driven by record investment banking revenue which was up nearly 70%.
On increased equity underwriting and M&A activity was partially offset by continued yield compression. Expenses increased 3% year on year as we continued to invest in controls but our overhead ratio is consistent with the prior year. We're reaching a peak in control cost in this business and you should expect expenses to stabilize from here.
Loan balances increased 11% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter. C&I loans grew 4% sequentially in line with the industry driven by higher utilization in our corporate client banking book. And in CRE loan growth was 3% continuing to exceed the industry on strong activity in both multifamily lending as well as real estate banking.
Finally on credit and reserve for the full firm we added a little over $100 million to reserves relating to oil and gas exposure this quarter, the majority of which is here in the Commercial Bank. We review our energy exposure on a name-by-name basis and under a range of commodity price assumptions.
This quarter's reserve build reflects downgrades in the E&P portfolio and if the current price environment continues it's reasonable to expect some further reserve builds during 2015 but relatively modest. However, in the context of a funded portfolio of $15 billion this is a very modest build and is fully within the range of our expectations at this part of the cycle for energy.
And although we're taking reserve it is not clear that they will translate into credit losses as the industry and our clients are not standing still but actively working to manage liquidity and leverage in the face of lower prices.
Moving to page 11 and Asset Management a good quarter in Asset Management, net income of $500 million and ROE of 22% and 27% pretax margin on $3 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 7% year on year driven by flows and higher banking balances and expense of $2.2 billion was up 5% year on year primarily driven by investments in infrastructure and controls and including modest legal expenses. This marks the 24th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows at $16 billion driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion up 7% year on year and client assets of $2.4 trillion, the strength in multi-asset and equity flows.
In banking we reported strong balances in both lending and deposits, average loan balances were up 8% year on year and average deposits up 6%. And we reported strong investment performance with 79% of mutual fund AUMs ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years.
Turning to Corporate and turning to page 12 Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $221 million but the results included a loss in the quarter of $173 million pretax primarily due to a timing impact of cost associated with certain nonoperating deposits we plan to exit. On other corporate as we've completed the spinoff of OEP and other portfolio sales during the first quarter the remaining private equity business is not expected to be a significant contributor to the firm's earnings. Therefore, beginning this quarter and going forward we will be disclosing our corporate private equity results as part of other corporate.
This quarter private equity contributed a modest positive to the results. Also included in the results of other corporate were $300 million pretax of legal expense which is largely offset by $177 million of net income from tax items.
Moving to page 13 and the outlook, I addressed most of this guidance through the presentation. I just want to highlight a couple of items.
First in CCB, in the Consumer businesses, a couple of geography points relative to analyst models. We guided in the fourth quarter to expect the first quarter's Consumer Bank revenues to be down on deposit margin compression. We saw that this quarter as expected and we expect deposit margins to remain pressured as rates remain low.
In the mortgage bank at Investor Day we guided for revenues to be down approximately $1 billion for the year on lower servicing revenues as well as lower repurchase benefit. We saw some of that this quarter and that guidance remains.
Against that as I said earlier across CCB we do expect to deliver a meaningful portion of the $2 billion expense reduction guidance in 2015. Finally on this page on Asset Management for the full-year expect the pretax margin in ROE to be at the low end of the through the cycle target range.
So wrapping up a strong result for the quarter in a constructive environment. We saw strong market and transaction activity despite continued margin compression. The performance continues to reflect the strength of each of our franchises, strong markets revenue and IB fees, 9% growth in retail deposits, 10% core loan growth and good progress against our capital, our balance sheet and our expense commitment.
With that, operator, please can you open up the line to questions.

          Hello there. Just one quick clarification question on the performance in equities was great. You mentioned pretty much across the board, do you think there's any seasonality, any one-time events, block trades, anything like that that would lift such good performance in the quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          There wasn't anything particularly noteworthy in terms of one-time events. It was really quite broad particularly in derivatives.
In cash the performance was I would say solid year over year because we saw strength in the Americas this year but we had strength in Europe last year. And I think the first-quarter 2014 wasn't particularly strong, so I think we were flatter a little bit with a relative comparison but it was a really strong absolute and we think probably strong relative performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And maybe this is a related question but I'm not sure which line it would flow through. From what I understand you guys and others have been pushing or talking with your prime brokerage clients to help improve ROAs in the business. Is part of that flowing through and just better equity performance, more business with clients?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, this is where it would be. I wouldn't say it's a driver, but we are as you said and the whole industry is looking to work with clients to optimize the use of the balance sheet and improve returns.
So we've seen some of that. But I wouldn't say it was a key driver.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, switching gears in Jamie's letter he talked about mentioning the need to push the new G-SIB rules to the product and the client level. And it piqued my curiosity.
I'm just curious, how different is that from what you've already done? In other words each step of the way you've been early in adopting and pushing out to the desk level higher capital charges. Does this just mean more of the same meaning, higher capital charge, higher capital charge or is there something different there that you need to do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is more of the same. Obviously G-SIB took on a slightly heightened focus when we had some doubling happen in the proposal in December.
So we've always been measuring and monitoring and tracking G-SIB at a very granular level. But we are obviously on a path now to aggressively manage it which means that we are going to be just a little bit more focused on that constraint, not uniquely also with advanced capital, standardized limits, balance sheet caps, the like. So it's more of the same, honestly, than just a heightened focus on this given the US proposal and given the impact of at least at this point FX translations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And different than RWA it affects certain products more than others. And we pointed out nonoperating deposits, stuff like that. Certain businesses more than others we've pointed out clearing and certain clients more than others we've pointed out financial institutions.
So it's just kind of a multi-variant theme. It's not mystical and we're actually already starting to reprice some of these businesses to get an adequate return on G-SIB capital. And we're seeing other people do that too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That's right. We may be in a different position with G-SIB but others are leverage constrained. And just generally speaking we are starting to see a lot more discipline around balance sheet and pricing is following somewhat generally.

John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hi, good morning Marianne. I was wondering on net interest income, do you have an outlet for how the net interest income dollars could trend from here? Assuming that you don't get much help from higher rates what are the key drivers and what's your outlook for NIM and NII dollars for the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So again assuming for a second that rates don't rise until the backend if not the end of the year and we can come back to that if you like we would expect our NII dollars to be stable to slightly up because we're still seeing growth in our interest-earning assets. Obviously this quarter we were down some on day count, it was a big chunk of the quarter-on-quarter reduction.
So we're really going to see the biggest lift in NII when we do see interest rates rise and we'll see when that is. And similarly on our NIM we would expect NIM to be stable particularly given as we talked about what we've seen dilute our NIM more particularly over the course of the last year or two has been this significant increase in cash and we're going to see some of that at least stabilize and turn as we start to reduce nonoperating deposits. So we should see our NIM relatively stable and again start to rise when rates rise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. On the CCAR do you expect any potential surcharges on the CCAR to come out when the US final rules on SIFI buffers come out?
And in addition to that have you learned anything from the CCAR in terms of the transparency of the process? Is there progression in terms of the back-and-forth with the regulators as you go through the CCAR process and their expectations?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, so taking your first point, Erika, obviously I don't know the next time we're going to in all likelihood get CCAR instructions including the rules and the minimums is likely to be some time towards the end of this year for the next CCAR cycle as we get prepared to deliver that. So all I can say is what you know which is clearly the door was left open for the minimum to be increased or potentially to include some element of the surcharge.
We're hopeful that that won't be the case because we would say the surcharge should be carried in baseline times to be used in stress and to have all firms end up well-capitalized afterwards. But I have no more insight than that for you.
With respect to the dialogue with the Fed look, it's definitely much, much further progressed than it was two years and three years ago and every year it gets better in terms of the bilateral conversations and it's constructive. I don't think, however, you could today or will likely ever be able to characterize it as transparent and clear, maybe potentially by design in terms of understanding or being able to reconcile exactly what their models do and what their results are driven by. So I won't be able to clarify for you what changed in their results or what differs between ours and theirs but the dialogue itself is definitely more constructive and more bilateral and more continuous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. The drop in the adjusted expenses I think about 3% year over year came in a little bit better than we were thinking while revenues were also a little bit better. Obviously you've got a lot of cost-saving programs underway that you mentioned earlier in the call and at Investor Day but should we think that maybe you're running ahead of schedule or that the cost saves could be more or is it just lumpiness as we go quarter to quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Look, I think that the best way to answer that is that we are still firmly with our guidance of adjusted expenses being $57 billion plus or minus by the end of the year or for the year, sorry. Obviously we will always try and outperform that but I wouldn't characterize one quarter as a change in that guidance at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, and then just separately obviously a big company out there announced it's exiting most of its banking assets and just wondering if there's any interest or appetite within your Commercial Bank to bulk up the acquisition there in terms of asset purchases versus a complete company?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So look the most important thing obviously in all of that is that we were delighted to be able to partner with the large company on their strategic transformation and that's the most important thing about that transaction for us. I'm not going to comment specifically on whether or what JPMorgan would be interested in in terms of asset purchases. We're much more focused on partnering strategically with the company.

Chris Spahr,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hi, this is Chris Spahr on behalf of Mike Mayo. I just have a question relating to your CET1 ratio guidance. Do you give any kind of guidance on the Tier 1 leverage ratio by the end of this year given your CET1 of 11%?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, we haven't given any specific guidance, Chris.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Spahr,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Do you think there is any way you will be able to kind of manage that ratio higher in the context of this year's CCAR?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          In the context of the CCAR we just had?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Spahr,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We expect our -- it's a little complicated this year and we sort of articulated it at Investor Day because we're going to move at some point whether it's the third of the fourth quarter to have standardized RWA be our binding constraint. So 11% plus or minus is our target on CET1 and that's all we've said.

Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [31]

          Thank you and good morning. Marianne you mentioned that Treasury Service revenues were down due to the trade finance revenue area. And I noticed on the balance sheet the trade finance outstandings have dropped meaningfully on a year-over-year basis. Can you share with us what's going on in that line of business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          There's a couple of different things. One was a little specific.
We had a portfolio of loans that we held for sale and have subsequently exited from the balance sheet which drives some of it. But in addition just generally a competitive environment and lower demand particularly in Asia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then second you mentioned that you obviously had a very strong advisory business in the quarter and you gained marketshare of 150 basis points. Do you have a sense of who you took the marketshare from? Was it European investment banks or US?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Not specifically, no. I will tell you that while we are obviously delighted with the performance it was a relatively strong market and there were some larger transactions so we're happy with the gains. I can't specifically comment on where it came from.

          Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on your energy comments.
Could you help us understand what events it was that led to the reserve building? Was it company-specific events in the form of bankruptcies or just something else in your internal ratings migration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, it's definitely more the latter. So basically if you think about our E&P portfolio in particular when we think about the redetermination somewhat semiannually of the borrowing base and looked at those companies on a client-specific name by name basis there was some contraction in the borrowing base and therefore some downgrades that drive our reserving methodology.
It doesn't mean that we feel that those companies are necessarily in significant difficulty but that's the way the reserving methodology works. And as I said we do this on a client by client basis, we're comfortable with our exposures and clients are looking to manage their own defensive position. So it's not clear that they will necessarily be realized in losses; in fact, if the implied curve rather than flat to long oil prices is in fact how things play out it's possible that there will be very little in the way of credit loss we'd experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And just on that last point your view on that is because of a recovery in prices rather than restructuring actions or things that your clients are undertaking. Is that fair or is it a bit of both?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Both. Both.

          Hi, good morning. I just wanted to see if I could just follow-up on the energy point.
Obviously you have the reserving and then you mentioned the 200 basis point impact on spend. I'm wondering if you'd just expand the discussion of energy, are there positive offsets that you're starting to see in the businesses elsewhere, either in terms of whether it's credit or borrowing or investment banking opportunities that may be popping up? Can you summarize the benefit if at this point you can see any positive offsets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, so first of all just on the contraction in spend driven by oil prices it's pretty typical in this part of the cycle that you would see lower energy prices in the first instance drive savings rates up and you see consumer spend for the energy dividend so to speak lag back. So the fact that we saw that happen in the first quarter is not atypical and it doesn't mean that we don't expect the spend to grow and for that energy dividend to ultimately translate into higher spend going forward. So it's more of a normal timing phenomenon is our expectation but with respect to other activity, yes we saw active equity capital markets with some defensive issuance and generally I think it's a positive overall for the businesses and for the economy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And my follow-up question is just with respect to the security services business you mentioned the change in presentation and then there was the client loss. Is there a way you can help us understand just what the organic growth rate of the business is adjusted for the reclassifications whether it's on a sequential-quarter or a year-over-year basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [44]

          Not readily but we can get back to you.

Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. Maybe just go back to the capital ratio issue for a second. You noted that standardized you're at 10.8% and that you still feel that will be your constraining factor by the end of this year.
So if you're already at 10.8% and your target is 11%, I know it's plus or minus, but it does seem like you got three quarters you hit 20 basis points. So is there anything unusual that you're expecting in the coming quarters or is it just you can never know quarter to quarter but all else being equal it looks like you can probably hit 11% if not better. Is that a fair way to think about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, nothing specific to call out in the second half of the year. And we should hit 11% if not a little better, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And as you've looked at the surcharge, at the G-SIB surcharge more the proposal is do you feel better or worse, you feel is there any areas where you think you can pull the lever more significantly to improve that ratio or lower the charge?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Look, I would say seven weeks or six weeks or whatever it is after Investor Day that the messaging hasn't really changed which is we have every intention of aggressively managing the score, doing it as we talked about earlier in a very granular way. And we're already working on that and you see that in the most obvious place which is in the reduction already to date in nonoperating deposits.
But we continue to work on all of the things so derivative notional compression, level III assets, financing, obviously we're still thinking about what the response should be in terms of risk intermediation and clearing. And so I think six weeks on from Investor Day the story is the same, we feel we are fully committed to ensuring that we are safely within the 4.5% bucket and we may not stop there but we're only a few months into this.

Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Marianne, going back to the reserve build which obviously was done for the oil and gas as you mentioned can you share with us in the Corporate & Investment Bank I know on a total dollar amount relative to the corporation it's not significant but there was a big increase in the nonaccrual loans from 110 to 251 in the quarter. Can you give us some color on what drove that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, I was obviously you noted it from a small base so that's notable. There are two specific transactions or two specific exposures that were moved to nonaccrual.
One of them was moved on a somewhat of a technicality, a sovereign downgrade which we fully expect to recover on. But that is just the way we have to present it and the other smaller piece was one other isolated exposure.
So I wouldn't overthink it right now. It's two exposures and it's $200 million in total.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And again that was not oil and gas related obviously, it's in the CIB area that was in the Commercial Bank?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The first the sovereign downgrade was did have oil and gas underlying exposure but again it was on a technicality rather than on the fundamentals of the Company. And we fully expect to recover on that.

Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [57]

          Good morning. You highlighted the Swiss franc is a tailwind for FICC. Could you may be size that for us?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, I would just say that overall our sense is that the market is neutral relative to the event. We happen to be able to benefit a little from it. Some others will be more neutral and some may have lost.
As these happen regular way in trading businesses and it just happens to be the case that that event and the volatility it drove is good for our client franchise. And I think it really just goes to show you that we're in a business where expertise matters and risk discipline matters and we were able to capitalize on both of those not just for the Swiss franc but also for the other macro events in the quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I know that the higher volatility of course would drive higher volumes, I was just talking about the event specifically and if there was some one-time gains involved in that so that we can adjust for a core figure here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, I wouldn't even characterize them as one-time gains. I would characterize them as one of a number of items that drove our performance in the business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, fair enough. And then on the energy front a lot of the focus was on the CB and the energy exposure there but you all mentioned that there's exposures in CIB, too. Can you give us may be an update if there was any changes in any of those exposures or loans this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, so overall the total firm the reserve build that we took was a little over $100 billion, 4/5 of which was in the Commercial Bank. So we did experience -- we do all of this on a name-by-name basis, so we did it across our portfolios but the majority was in the CB E&P portfolio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, thank you very much. On your deposit discussion about pushing out I think you said during your Investor Day that you would like to get about $3 billion of noncore deposits off the balance sheet and I know you said you hope to make progress in the second quarter. How should we model that out and what type of benefit have you modeled out to the NIM with that $3 billion of deposits?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It was $100 billion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          $100 billion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          $100 billion. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No worries. $100 billion, I mean look at the end of the day you can see that over the course of the last since whatever the third quarter of 2012 our cash balances grew by a couple hundred billion dollars and that has been a very large contributor to the compression in our NIM, not the only one.
So as we push out the nonoperating deposits we would expect to see that help but remember we're still growing retail deposits. So if you look at this quarter in particular even though we reduced our nonop deposits related to client actions by about $20 billion, the majority of that $24 billion, we have flat deposits so we're continuing to grow the good retail deposits. So I would say it would be a tailwind but it would be a tailwind to a stabilizing and slightly improving NIM outside of rate rises.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then real quick on your professional services, professional services was down from $2 billion to $1.6 billion. Is that mainly due to some of that legal cost maybe starting to go away from the crisis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, I'm sorry of the top of my head can't remember the number you're saying. But no, our legal expenses, forget the legal expense that relates to reserves that we've taken and settlements that we reached, our regular way expense for third parties in legal isn't down substantially quarter on quarter or year on year at this point, although at some point it will be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hi, good morning. So Marianne I was hoping that we could dig into the RWA progress that we saw in the quarter and specifically was hoping that you could disaggregate how much of the sequential decline that we saw was a function of the planned mitigation actions and model benefits that you've cited versus actual FX driven declines?
Because assuming that the US dollar strength persists all else equal one could surmise that we should expect RWAs in a long-term context actually coming out below that $1.5 trillion target that you've cited in the past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So specifically with respect to the quarter I would say that the wholesale parameter update -- wholesale credit parameter updates model benefits is about half of the RWA reduction with the other half coming from regular way portfolio run off as well as some reductions in market risk associated with market risk positions, reductions in private equity, reductions in commitment. So some position reductions rather than driven specifically by FX.
Look, we're running above $1.5 trillion now and we said we're going to manage both the advance and standardize to that number over the course of the next couple of years. So if FX or if the currency translation is a tailwind then we would hope to do better but at this point let's get there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, fair enough. And another question on capital but relating to CCAR. Marianne you've noted on this call and in the past that you don't expect CCAR to be JPMorgan's binding constraint longer term but just given the reduction that we saw in the ask or the need to use the Mulligan in the last exam I was just hoping you could cite some of the planned mitigation actions that you expect to take so that we could see you guys get on the path towards delivering on that 55% to 75% net payout target.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So at the moment our CET1 ratio launching into CCAR was below 10%, not the 12% that we expect to run at once we have built our capital to our target level. And so you are right that right now under CCAR Tier 1 leverage was our binding constraint both last year and this year.
And so a combination of our capital strategy around how we think about the issuance of preferred together with balance sheet actions will be how we think about mitigating that limitation in the short to medium term. But ultimately it doesn't change the fact that once we get to our target assuming that is the 12% that we articulated at Investor Day that again we don't think we should be leverage constrained, so yes we're going to work on that obviously and we are continuing to build capital but when we launched into CCAR we weren't at that level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. Jamie you warned in your annual letter about the possibility of another flash crash. Yesterday I think Simon Potter at the Fed warned about it and cited HFT as one of the issues.
Larry Summers warned about it about a week ago. Are these warnings going anywhere, are they being translated into action anywhere in the system?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          To give you a little perspective I also spoke in that the banking system is much stronger to start with and every bank in the system is much stronger. So just trying to think through what are the effects of some of these things and we look at it is kind of a warning shot across the bow. What I worry about more is what happens in a stress environment and I think people are paying attention to what's going on in the markets and if there has to be changes down the road there might be some changes that are relevant to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Bush,  NAB Research LLC - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Secondly, Marianne a question about Commercial Banking. The returns in Commercial Banking have remained in sort of the high teens over the last number of quarters and it's certainly respectable sort of 17% to 19%. Is there any way those returns improve materially or as rates go up or does that get offset by competitive factors and are we at a normalized level for that business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think the best way to think about it is through the cycle target that Doug Petno put out at Investor Day which is 18%. So that doesn't mean to say that we will benefit when rates rise in this business and it is very competitive and spreads are compressing and there's a lot of factors going on but through the cycle 18% so we're some years below and some above.
Just the question on core growth and security services outside of presentation changes and client exits is currently in the low single digits. So obviously a little bit muted because we're working on the balance sheet optimization but certainly growing and in the low single digits and in terms of looking at advisory and who we are gaining share from principally European banks.
Okay, no more questions?
