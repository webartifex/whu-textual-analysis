Presentation

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second-quarter earnings call. This call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you and good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation. It's available on our website and please, if you could, refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
So starting off on page 1, firm different delivered strong performance this quarter: net income of $6.3 billion, EPS of $1.54, and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.5 billion. The quarter's performance was characterized by strong underlying fundamentals across each of our businesses. With stable NIM and NII, good growth in fee drivers as well as strong IBCs, good expense discipline with adjusted expenses flat quarter on quarter at $14.2 billion, and an adjusted overhead ratio of 58%, and low levels of charge-offs and call loans up 12% year on year.
We also made significant progress on our balance sheet and we've delivered on our non-operating deposit commitment.
While there were no significant items this quarter, there were some small items that are worth calling out. On the positive side, we had consumer loan loss reserves releases of a little over $300 million as well as a little under $300 million of a benefit in DDA/SEA and wider spreads. Against that we saw reserve builds across wholesale of $250 million, of which approximately $140 million related to oil and gas, as well as firm-wide legal expense of a little less than $300 million. If you take those for items and net them, together they contributed zero to net income.
So finally included in the result is $330 million of a benefit from tax discrete items. If you adjust for all of those, our net income is strong at $6 billion.
Skipping over page 2 and on to page 3, we continued to make progress against our capital targets with the firm's advanced fully phased-in CET1 ratio reaching 11%, up 35 basis points quarter on quarter, and standardized fully phased-in was 11.2%. The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation along with an overall reduction to risk-weighted assets, primarily from lower risk across market and counterparty credit as well as some data enhancements with loan growth offsetting runoff.
We continue to build Tier 1 capital, adding $3.4 billion of preferred stock this quarter, and we returned $2.6 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of net repurchases and dividends of $0.44 a share. Preferred issuance, together with a reduction in average assets, drove the firms SLR to reach 6%.
For more details on our balance sheet reduction, turn to page 4.
The last quarter I told you that you should expect us to make meaningful progress on our balance sheet in this quarter and we did just that. Year-to-date our balance sheet is down over $120 billion on a spot basis, driven by a reduction of over $100 billion of non-operating deposits across our wholesale businesses, partially offset by continued growth in consumer deposits. We also saw a $36 billion reduction in trading assets and secured financing as we continue to make progress simplifying our balance sheet.
On the previous page you may have seen that HQLA was down $82 billion this quarter, primarily reflecting those lower levels of cash. However, the firm remains LCR compliant given the significant outflow assumptions that was associated with those deposits.
In addition, the reduction in deposits together with strong core loan growth resulted in an improved loan-to-deposit ratio, up 5% since year-end. These balance sheets actions translate into relatively flat NIM, up 2 basis points quarter on quarter and NII. Quarter on quarter, the reduction in cash drove a 4 basis point improvement that was partially offset by lower yields, and as I said, firm NII was flat.
Turning to page 5 and consumer and community banking, the performance for the combined consumer businesses was characterized by sequential revenue growth on stronger fee revenue and positive operating leverage, generating $2.5 billion of net income, an ROE of 19%, and an overhead ratio of 56%. Revenue of $11 billion was down 4% year on year, driven by mortgage, but up 3% quarter on quarter on seasonally higher credit and debit sales volume as well as higher MSR revenue.
Our focus on customer experience continues to drive growth broadly and we have 19% core loan growth driven by mortgage. Also, our active mobile customer base is up 22% to over 21 million customers. We are the largest and fastest-growing among major US banks, reflecting our strategic objective to have a best-in-class mobile offering.
We remain focused on our commitment to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014, while continuing to self-fund investment in the business. In the first half of this year expenses were down approximately $0.5 billion versus the same period last year and our headcount down roughly 6,000 year to date.
Moving to consumer and business banking on page 6, CBB generated net income of $831 million, flat quarter on quarter and down 8% year on year with an ROE of 28%. Net interest income was flat sequentially with modest spread compression offset by deposit growth and NIR was up 7% seasonally and 2% year on year on continued strong client investment and debit revenue.
Expenses were up 1% year on year, largely due to increased legal costs. Excluding these, expenses were down 2% due to continued improvements in branch efficiency. We continue to see robust performance across our drivers with attrition well below industry averages, average deposit balances up 9%, or $41 billion year on year, and we are pleased to see that 30% of this growth is driven by our investments in business banking and CPC and new builds.
Client investment assets were a record, up 8% or $16 billion, and in business banking average loan balances were up 6% with loan originations flat against a record last year and in a highly competitive environment.
Stepping back and looking forward to the second half, our NII is stable and will increase when rates rise. Non-interest revenue is growing solidly and expenses will decrease, so we expect positive operating leverage.
Mortgage banking on page 7. Mortgage net income was $584 million for the quarter. Originations were $29 billion, up 19% quarter on quarter on seasonal increases in the purchase market. We continued to execute our strategy of adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, totaling $19 billion this quarter and the origination pipeline continues to look strong.
Total revenue increased sequentially, primarily driven by higher MSR revenue, but as you can see, you look at our non-interest revenue it's down $500 million year on year. We still expect non-interest revenue to be down about $1 billion for the full year in line with previous guidance.
Expenses of $1.1 billion were down $200 million, or 15%, year on year and down 9% quarter on quarter despite higher volumes as we continued to manage down our costs. On credit we continued to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies, and as a result we released $300 million of NCI reserves this quarter. And you can see our charge-off rate was 21 basis points.
Moving on to page 8, card commerce solutions and auto. Overall net income of $1.1 billion, up 30% year on year, and an ROE of 23%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year on year on card sales volume and auto loan and lease growth, partially offset by spread compression. Card revenue rate for the quarter at 12.4% was up quarter on quarter seasonally.
Expense was down 4% year on year driven by lower legal expense with the recent settlement regarding debt sale and collection practices having previously been reserved. And in card we saw core loan growth of 3% and sales growth of 7%, with delinquency rates and charge-offs remaining low.
Commerce solutions continued to experience strong growth with volumes up 12% year on year, driven by continued strong spend and the addition of new merchants. We've recently signed several new strategic clients including Chevron, Cinemark, Gap Inc., Marriott, and Rite Aid. Together they represent an incremental 5% to our volume and the majority have signed up for ChaseNet.
Lastly in auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used-car values. We saw average loan and lease balances up 8% year on year and the pipeline is healthy.
Moving to page 9 and the corporate and investment bank. Before I dig into the numbers, we did make some reporting changes this quarter. If you look at the top of the table, investment banking fees is now named investment banking revenue and principally this now incorporates the revenue share with the commercial bank here in this line, rather than in the market revenues where it was previously being reported.
Additionally, trade finance revenue, which was previously reported in treasury services, is now being reported in lending.
So digging into the numbers, CIB reported net income of $2.3 billion on revenue of $8.7 billion and an ROE of 14%, reflecting a strong result in a mixed environment. In banking, IB revenue of $1.7 billion is up 4% year on year. This quarter we continued to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.2% wallet share and widening the gap to number two. We ranked number one in fees in North America and EMEA and gained share, improving to number two, in Asia.
Another strong quarter for advisory, up 17% year on year as activity levels remained high. We maintained our number-two ranking and grew share by over by over 100 basis points from last quarter. Equity underwriting fees were down 5% from a strong prior year for IPOs in EMEA with lower wallet share as we gave back some of the outsized share gain we had in the first quarter. This quarter we ranked number two globally with strong performance in the US on acquisition finance and follow-ons.
Debt underwriting up 1% and we maintained our number-one ranking with strength in high grade also on the back of the healthy M&A market. Treasury services was down 2% year on year on lower net interest income and the lending item of $302 million was down 32% year on year, primarily driven by losses on restructured securities. Given the reporting changes we've made, going forward we should expect for treasury services revenues would be about $875 million, plus or minus, per quarter and lending approximately $350 million. And that is given the trade finance transfer.
Moving on to markets, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 1% year on year, excluding business simplification and the gain in the prior year on the IPO of Markit, which we previously disclosed, but with strong relative performance in rates and in equity markets. Fixed income revenue was $2.9 billion, down 10% year on year similarly adjusted.
In macro products the quarter was dominated by EMEA with a bond selloff and economic and political uncertainty, including Greece. This uncertainty slowed the momentum we saw in the first quarter and kept clients on the sidelines in currencies and emerging markets, but drove strong performance in rates.
Credit and securitized products were down on a continuation of general weakness in the market. And as I mentioned, equity markets had another strong quarter, up 27% year on year on revenue of $1.6 billion with strong performance in all three regions relative to last year and outperformance in Asia, particularly China and Hong Kong, on the back of client interest, first to participate in the rally and later to hedge.
Looking forward, business simplification would drive a 9% decline year on year in third-quarter markets revenues with a corresponding decline in expenses. And as I look into the third quarter in analyst models, I see relative to our markets results this quarter you have revenues in markets going up sequentially. We are fully expecting to see normal seasonal declines in the third-quarter markets revenues.
Security service revenues of $1 billion was in line with guidance, up seasonally on the European dividend season. And moving on to expense, total expense was down 15% year on year at $5.1 billion and an overhead ratio of 59% as we successfully executed the expense reduction associated with business simplification and with lower legal expense. Compensation expense down 4% year on year comped a revenue ratio for the second quarter of 30%, flat year on year.
Moving on to the commercial bank. In commercial banking the underlying businesses continued to perform well with strong loan growth, up $6 billion dollars quarter on quarter and record end-of-period loan balances, with good credit fundamentals and no non-performing loans. We also saw continued momentum in IB revenue off of a record last quarter, which was driven by a large transaction. However, we added $187 million to reserves in the quarter, reflecting select downgrades including oil and gas. Despite this, BAU credit performance at the portfolio, as I said, remains very strong.
This drove net income of $525 million on revenue of $1.7 billion and an ROE of 14%. Revenue was flat year on year, driven by continued spread compression in loans and deposits partially offset by growth in loans, and flat sequentially despite the record investment banking performance in the first quarter. Expenses were up 4% year on year on increased control-related staffing and down slightly quarter on quarter. For the rest of the year for each quarter we expect expenses to remain around $720 million.
Loan balances increased 12% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter. C&I loans grew 3% sequentially, in line with the industry, with middle-market growth being somewhat challenged by strong competition but with more strength in corporate client banking driven by short-term financing activity and new facilities for our existing client base. CRE loans grew 5% and continued to exceed the industry on strong activity in both commercial term lending, which had record originations in the quarter, and in real estate banking.
Moving on to page 11 and asset management. Net income of $451 million on revenue of $3.2 billion reflected solid growth, up 6% year on year and 6% quarter on quarter, driven by continued net long-term inflows marking the 25th consecutive quarter at $13 billion with strength in North America and multi-asset flows; driving record AUMs of $1.8 trillion, up 4% year on year, and client assets of $2.4 trillion. In addition, we had record loan balances which were up 9% year on year.
Expense of $2.4 billion was up 17% year on year, primarily driven by legal expense and to a lesser extent the impact of moving assets to held-for-sale. Adjusting for those two items, expense would have been up more in line with revenue and margins in line with our targets. Lastly, we reported strong investment performance with 78% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years.
Turning to page 12 and corporate, treasury and CIO reported a net loss of a little over $100 million and other corporate reported net income of $552 million, which included a benefit on discrete tax items I previously mentioned. So on page 13 is our outlook page. Any guidance that I was going to give I've made through the presentation. The page is here for your reference.
So to wrap up, strong reported and strong underlying results this quarter across our businesses in an environment that continues to remain somewhat challenging with double-digit core loan growth, with broad-based strength in our underlying drivers, and with continued execution and excellent progress against our capital, our balance sheet, and expense commitments.
So with that, operator, we will open up the line now for Q&A.

          My first question is the capital progress has currently been solid this quarter; last week, however, there seems to have been more support in the Fed in terms of including the SIFI surcharge in the CCAR test. And I guess the question is in two parts: one, what do you think the chances are of the -- any or all of the CCAR surcharge or the CET1 surcharge to be included in CCAR; and two, what are the next steps in terms of business model adjustments, if that did pass?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So to -- obviously we don't have any particular insight. I think the comments you're referring to were comments about the support for evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all [of it]. And so really it hasn't changed relative to previous comments and the door has clearly been left open for that, but we have no further information. And so far it's evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of the surcharge, so we're just going to have to I suppose and see.
Meanwhile, as you know, we are -- and by the way, if it happens for us it would happen for everyone. We have shown you before -- not that that's a good outcome, but we've shown you before that we think that regardless the competitive peers set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels. And so if everybody has to increase their minimum, it is going to be a similar position for everyone.
Meanwhile, we are continuing to execute on everything that we've already told you we are going to do to optimize our capital. Our commitment is to go to firmly within the 4.5% bucket for the surcharge, and if we believe we can do it and it's economic and it's not going to hurt our clients, we may go further. So we will respond when we see the rules and we are not going to stop continuing to do the best we can to optimize our returns based on scarce resources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. And just the second question is you've clearly made also progress in terms of your deposit mix. As we potentially anticipate a rising rate environment for the back half of the year, given what the regulators have done in terms of saying, okay, here are the good deposits, here are the not-so-good deposits, how should we expect the pace and magnitude of retail deposit repricing or pass-through if the Fed does raise rates in the second half of this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We actually haven't really changed our point of view since the investor day and previously about the fact that we are expecting retail deposit -- and there are other people who have slightly differing views. But we are expecting retail deposits to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles, given the competition for good, high-quality, LCR-compliant retail deposits; given the advancements in mobile banking; given the awareness in the general environment around low rates and the desire to participate in rising rates. So when we think about our sensitivity and our reprice, we model it in assumption that it's going to be higher, somewhat higher.

          I see your markets revenue are down 1% year over year the way you look at this, but I'm trying to reconcile that with Jamie's comments two months ago at a New York conference where you said there is repricing in rates derivatives, prime brokerage, clearing, and trade finance. I'm guessing it's just risk off.
Can you shed more light on what type of repricing you are seeing with any specific examples, because the transparency for us on the outside is pretty weak?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Obviously, when you talk about trading, when you have two months to go in a quarter you don't know the exact number and repricing is a complex issue. I'll give you some very specific things and then I'll tell you why it's hard to figure out exactly what shows up.
Clearing, we've definitely seen people start to charge for clearing and effectively charge the balance sheet 25, 50 basis points. It's a small business so I don't think it's going to dramatically affect those lines. Prime broker, we've seen similar type of thing.
Repo, it seems that people are charging pretty much for repo. We need to get a return on it. Exotic derivatives, which are again very small, are being repriced to, I would say, full capital and liquidity. Muni credit has probably been repriced a little bit. Again, it's a small market.
If you go to credit and trading, so credit we've really not seen any repricing effectively in commercial credit. You've seen a little bit in mortgage to make up for the extra costs in mortgage. You've seen a little bit in auto; it got more aggressive, not less aggressive. So trade finance you've seen a little bit of repricing, and I know these are not all trading numbers.
What you don't see, Mike, is that in a lot of cases, while you may have repriced a little bit, you're also shedding business so that you have -- as you are protecting your margins by -- because of AML costs you are going to not do certain types of business anymore. In FHA the lifetime cost of servicing, you cut back on FHA volumes, etc. So you're protecting your margins, but you're actually shrinking your revenues in some cases. That's happening a little bit in clearing and prime broker and stuff like that; you want your best clients.
In other categories clients are -- like deposits, we haven't seen repricing effectively, I don't think, in non-operating deposits. On the other hand, some clients are saying let's restructure our relationship; it makes more sense for you, JPMorgan. I'm willing to give you other business which is not credit sensitive, etc.
It's kind of a whole of the amount of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return on your capital, not necessarily to show revenue growth in that line item. It's very easy to show revenue growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And just one follow-up. When you say (multiple speakers)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Mostly what you see in trading is just volume related and spread related, etc. Even in trading, spreads are narrow but breadth is also very low, which means spreads get gap out pretty quickly, which eventually could be good for trading. So it's unclear (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          When you say a little repricing, is it bigger than a breadbox? Are we talking about basis points or 1% or 5%? What are you talking about here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'm talking about basis points, 20 basis points, 15 basis points, 10 basis points. That's all you need in some of these things to get an adequate return on capital as we currently look at capital.

          Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Question on the deposit shrinkage. You obviously finished the program you announced at investor day. Just wondering if you're going to take it further; what the impact on revenues has been. And do you expect that the full benefit to NIM is already in 2Q or -- in the 2Q numbers or we are going to see more benefit in 3Q from the actions you took?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So what I said, and hopefully it was clear, is that we actually exceeded our commitment. We actually shrunk our non-operating deposits by more than $100 billion and not just through our consumer deposits, but we are also able to grow wholesale operating deposits. So we had a good mix shift both in consumer versus wholesale, but also within wholesale and so we feel really great about that.
There are two priorities after that. The first is protecting that position and making sure that we are able to not have inflows of those deposits as the industry continues to absorb them. But the second is we will likely look to potentially push a little farther, but it gets harder and harder each margin, the next $5 billion or $10 billion, as you get more and more closely aligned to operating accounts and operating business. And we've always said that we want to do this for the right reasons, for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that's going to materially harm our clients. So that's the lens.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The [product] has also been made in the Level III assets: derivative receivables, certain balance sheet items, RWA. So the effort to optimize the balance sheet for G-SIFI, etc., is not going to stop; that we are going to continue to do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          But you know what, I don't anticipate us launching another and announcing another program. We've already done a little better. We will continue to try and do a little better.
In terms of revenue impact, not very much right now, as you might very well know, because you can see that the balance is much more on a spot basis that on an average basis. But the equation looking forward will be much the same math we said at investor day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for a half a year, but there would be some expense benefits on FDIC costs, etc. So not a very big number.
I think that was the question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, and the NIM benefit should flow into 3Q as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A little bit, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Marianne, was wondering if could remind us about the timing of your expense reduction targets in the consumer and investment bank. Specifically, if you hit the $57 billion in adjusted expenses for 2015, how much of the ultimate cost saves does that $57 billion target for this year incorporate? How much would you have achieved already in 2015 and any thoughts on the trajectory for remaining saves after this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, so let me do this in two parts, and I'm going to start with the consumer businesses, where the commitment is actually a couple of years old and we are sort of well, well on our way to delivering against that -- the commitment $2 billion dollars in 2017 versus 2014. It's not exactly linear, but you can consider it to flow through time.
And if you look at the CCB page on whatever page that is, I think we show that for the first half of the year our expenses are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion. So that gives you a sense for how we are tracking. On the CIB, obviously the commitment is somewhat newer; at investor day this year $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014.
I would characterize that in two parts. $1.5 billion is business simplification. The majority of business simplification -- not all, but the majority -- will come out of our run rate in 2015. And you've already seen that in the first and second quarter when you've seen the $300 million, $400 million expense reductions in each of the quarters on business simplification.
The other $1.3 billion, which is all the reductions in technology and operations and headcount, is going to be things. We are working on it actively -- we have programs, we have people -- but it's going to be more of a 2016 and 2017 benefit. If I was to look at the first half of 2015 versus the first half of 2014, take the $500 billion in consumer and business simplification in the CIB space -- that's probably the right way to size it, about a quarter so far this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A quarter of the total?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, great. Then a quick follow-up is on RWA. Any update to your year-end RWA targets and thoughts about how we should think about potential RWA levels longer term?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          RWA, advance RWA is down $36 billion, $37 billion; [one five three six]. We said a little greater than $1.5 trillion. We are still on track to be $1.5 trillion or a little greater, $1.5 trillion advanced at the end of the year. Standardized right now is at $1.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion, so pretty close to $1.5 trillion against the target at the end of the year of $1.55 trillion.
That's a little better, but obviously on the standardized you have some upward pressure as we continue to grow those really great loans that we are growing. If you look to our investor day targets, we are still hoping to maintain the discipline around both of those at approximately $1.5 trillion through time.

          I'm just curious in terms of your core loan growth; you mentioned that that's up about 12% year over year. Can you give us a sense as to where that's growing the strongest and where you're seeing a bit more weakness? Within the core loan growth, specifically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Of course. I'll do it in three parts. First of all, it is growing pretty solidly or strongly, so either in-line or in many cases better than the industry across most of the product categories. The one that's growing the most strongly because of the way we are portfolioing loans is mortgage, so that's driving some of that outperformance. And the one that is most challenging, but still growing, is middle market. Fiercely competitive; everybody is chasing that sector.
But you can go through the businesses. We had 6% loan growth, 8% loan and lease growth in auto; 6% business banking; 19% core in consumer; 4% in commercial, so 3% core in card. So it's solid to strong pretty much across the board; most competitive in middle-market and flattered by portfolio and mortgages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, Marianne, and for my follow-up I noticed I guess you were quoted in an earlier meeting today suggesting that there could be further provisions for the oil and gas portfolio. There's been some media reports prior to this week about regulators potentially looking a bit more carefully at your portfolio as well as a number of other banks.
Can you give us a little more color as to how you are thinking about the potential trends there and any comment you might want to give in terms of where the regulators are focusing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          What I said earlier is not inconsistent; it's entirely consistent with what we said last quarter. We built reserves modestly for oil and gas last quarter on the back of the spring redetermination of borrowing base. We feel another modest reserve this quarter.
And we said we don't -- we might expect more reserves in the second half of the year. There's another redetermination cycle in the fall and it's I'm not going to say likely, but it's possible we will be selectively downgrading some clients. If none of that is out of our expectations, it's completely normal levels considering the cycle and how we think about the credits, we are still very happy.
And we are not going to make any comments on regulators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Those reserves do not mean we're going to have losses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Correct. We are reserving for downgrades; doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to be cash losses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Marianne, just wanted to follow up on that last point. Your commentary about credit, for the second half, is in line, you're $4 billion plus and you've got $1 billion of charge-offs this quarter again. So on that point just one question about where you continue to see underling improvements. Card obviously is still above your guidance, but can you give us some of the thoughts about where any existing improvement can come from?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So credit, like charge-offs, have been very benign across the whole sales base. They have reverted to somewhat more normal levels in auto, so I'm not expecting there to be a big step changes in the underlying charge-offs in the wholesale space. We continue to see improvements at a slower pace in mortgage, but at 21 basis points we are sort of getting down there.
And card, while it is slightly above -- 2.6% above our 2.5% is also pretty much getting there. It's one of the reasons why we've said expect the second half to look like the first half in terms of order of magnitude and expect net-net low for long.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then to your point about not expecting to be much loss from the energy provisioning and that we could see energy provisioning, plus this quarter you had a nice $300 million release from the NCI portfolio, is this kind of it for reserve release and can you talk about your outlook there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I would say in the non-credit -- sorry, just to clarify the comment on oil and gas; we said they will not necessarily translate into losses. We are not going to predict which ones will or won't.
On the reserves, for non-credit-impaired portfolio we are continuing to see improvements in charge-offs as well as home prices, albeit a little bit more gradually. So I would still expect there to be more reserve releases over the course of the next 18 months in hundreds of millions of dollars in total; not billions any longer, of course. We have $1.8 billion reserved right now.
In the post-credit-impaired space clearly that's life-of-loan model and so we will continue to evaluate that model against parameters that we have in it and expectations, so that will be what it is at the time. And in card we're not expecting any significant reserve actions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe we could just ask a question on card fees? That's been an area where growth in card fees have been pretty flat for a while as you ramp up reward spending. We saw a pretty nice jump quarter over quarter; some of that is seasonal, but it was a little stronger than what we saw the last couple of years.
Are we getting to a point where you are lapping some of these higher reward costs and growth in new accounts and we should start to see that revenue line track more closely with spending, or is this something unusual this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So you are absolutely right; all the underlying phenomenon are still there. We are still seeing spread compression, but we are seeing very strong growth in spend. We aren't quite lapped yet on new accounts going through the revenue rate. We will eventually be, but it's a good thing to be adding these new accounts that will drive strong spend in the future.
So I would say our near-term guidance is that we are expecting our revenue rate to be at the lower end of that 12%, 12.5% range. And, yes, over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships we would expect that to start to edge up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And on the card loan side it seemed like you saw a decent uptick this quarter. You are starting to get past some of the runoff and it seemed more of a core driver.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. We told you we would hope to drive core loan growth in the card space low single digits and this quarter it was 3%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [44]

          I just want to emphasize -- Marianne mentioned it, but emphasize; Chase Paymentech, which is seeing really good growth, probably 50% faster than the industry, but we are also signing people with Chase Paymentech combined with ChaseNet. We are running real volume across it and we are signing up a lot of folks for that and ChasePay. So the strategy of ours is kind of coming to fruition and we hope it will be a good driver; happy customers and good growth for the next 10 years.

Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So first question on capital. I just want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about preferred issuance plans going forward now that you've met the 150 basis point RWA target.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Obviously we don't give you lots of details on our issuance plans. You are right; one of the drivers for us to issue in part, not exclusively, was it's not -- as you know, we were Tier 1 leverage constrained in CCAR and so as a result of issuing this we not only helped TLAP, but we help our CCAR stress capacity. And we are about 164 RWA. So we are not going to talk about forward issuance but we've made progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then just a follow-up regarding, Marianne, your comments about the trading outlook for at least in the near term, recognizing it's still very early days in the quarter. Since the very start we've seen, or at least we've experienced, a number of global shocks and on the regulatory front we do have the Volcker implementation deadline, which is looming. So taking all those factors into consideration, how should we be thinking about the near-term trading outlook?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So to start with Volcker, we aren't expecting Volcker to have an impact in the near-term trading outlook. We've been talking very consistently over an extended period of time about the fact that we've reshaped our business through time to be compliant in substance and in form with Volcker. And so while that was real reshaping of the business, the last 18 months have been really focused on getting operationally ready around the reporting and the metrics; it's been hard work and we are ready.
So I don't expect it to have a direct impact on our near-term trading. Clearly over time we need to continue to evolve the feedback loop with regulators, but that will be entirely gradual.
With respect to the trading, it is too early for us to say anything specific about the second quarter -- sorry, the third quarter -- except to say we are -- all other things equal, we would expect to see normal seasonality from the market. Nothing has changed that fundamentally wouldn't have us expecting normal seasonality in the third quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time, has been -- we've become very consistent. I think in 2014 we had no trading loss days and even this year there were only a handful of trading loss days. Obviously some areas are up and some are down, but our shares are high. I think we are doing a great job servicing clients.
We are adopting all the new rules. Like [50%] of interest-rate swaps are on SEF today and I think it's 95% of FX trading by transaction is electronic. You can do a lot on your mobile phone or iPad now, so the business is actually doing fine. The returns on risk are very good. We used to report that, but kind of return on VAR are very good. It's become a much more stable business that clients need overtime.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right. And just to add to that, I would say that we also talked about, in the period of transition towards a more normal economy and rising rates, you might see some shocks like this. We've weathered both the EMEA bond sell off and China well, and it just speaks to the strength of our risk management discipline. And we generally do pretty well in more difficult markets.

Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [53]

          You guys had a very decent mortgage banking quarter in the second quarter with rates going up. We know that the refis have started to come down, but the purchase market has been stronger I think than people expected in the second quarter. What do you see going into the third and fourth quarter, especially with the new regulations coming out with the disclosures with (inaudible)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So with respect to -- we saw a stronger seasonal purchase market. We actually gained a little share in the purchase market in the quarter and refi held up pretty well because of pipelines coming into the quarter. But we are expecting that to grow seasonally in purchase and in refi to pull that down to smaller levels in the third seasonally. And no direct impact from the disclosure requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Part of the quarter is the reserve takedown, so don't double count that. That may not be there next quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (multiple speakers) Can you talk a little bit about the tax --? My follow-up question on the tax rate. Should we be modeling in 28% to 30% going forward; is that 25% just an outlier?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The way I would think about it is normal tax rate for the year is 30%, plus or minus. Just given the way tax reserving is it's usually biased to being fairly conservative and so, as you know, we have seen discrete tax gains periodically, some of them not insignificant, resulting from completion of settlements and audits with tax authorities. Not to say that you should necessarily model in directly 30%, but we don't predict or forecast the tax benefits.

          The equity trading has been very strong the last couple quarters, both for you and for others, assuming it continues the rest of this earnings season. As you step back and think about some of the drivers there, you mentioned some repricing; we've obviously seen some deepening of some markets, increased volatility. Can we think about there being potentially a long-term secular recovery in the equities trading, or do you think it's more just stocks are going up, just global QE, or too early to tell?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It's definitely the latter and I think it's perhaps a little too early to tell on the former.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then just separately, what type of mortgage loans are you adding? Are these jumbo? Are they fixed rate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Jumbo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So over half are jumbo, the other are conventional performing fee plus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And I guess are you choosing to add some mortgage loans instead of securities? Because you've got a smaller securities book than a lot of peers and it seems like there's capacity to add there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We have a fairly large securities portfolio and our decisions around that are in part driven by our overall interest-rate risk positioning, but with respect to the mortgages it's fundamentally a better execution decision for us. We will portfolio or loan where it makes economic sense to do it relative to distributing it, other than jumbo where, clearly, they will always go on our balance sheet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          If you can put a jumbo on a higher ROE than a Fannie/Freddie, you would do that. And part of the investment portfolio is for liquidity and obviously, because non-operating deposits are down, proportions of that will come down too.

Glenn Schorr,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just want to follow up on the conversation in fixed income, and I agree with you; it seems like you weathered the whole Greece and China storm pretty well. The thought on the lack of liquidity in the fixed income markets gets a lot of attention. You guys have the most market share; have the lowest standard deviation in the business. As a liquidity provider that's a good thing for you.
But curious on how you are thinking about preparing for what seems to be a pretty serious issue and how serious of an issue do you think it is in terms of the potential disruption?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          There's been a lot of press and reports, including recently, on market liquidity and there are a number of factors playing into it. It's true that liquidity, in some cases, has dried up quite quickly when there's been extreme volatility and it fed on itself. But the reality is that we've talked about the fact that that was likely to be a phenomenon that happened more frequently as we transition to a more normal environment.
We are very disciplined about how we trade and support our clients and generally we've been able to weather them very well, as has generally the community. Not that we know, but we haven't got any stories or horror stories around (inaudible) a bond sell-off or other things this quarter. So I think it's definitely an issue; one that we need to watch, one that has multiple root causes, and one that we are generally taking in our stride.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And look at the big picture and we pointed it out, the financial system -- like in the United States banks are much more sound. Trading books have more capital liquidity. The whole system is better off. So you can't look at one piece and say what will that do.
The second is that these -- obviously there's less liquidity in the marketplace and it's a whole bunch of factors. It's hard to tease out exactly which one, but trading books have more capital and more liquidity. I think people are a little worried about potential Volcker rule violations, so they are being a little more cautious.
There are obviously structural changes in electronic trading, HFT, and each business is slightly different. So not every -- I wouldn't say everyone is affected exactly the same. It's also true that the system is pretty resilient to what happened with the currencies and treasury, and that's a good sign.
I think what we are going to be really cautious about is when markets aren't that good. JPMorgan is fine. We are not talking about whether or not JPMorgan is going to have a hard time with liquidity. We are not. The question I really would have is, when markets are tough, will there be a feedback from -- these violent markets, will there be more volume or less volume.
Someone was quoted the other day saying markets always pull back when there are tough times; that is true. The question is will be harder and worse, will it feed back into the real economy. It's not will there be lack of liquidity.
During the crisis they were two market makers out there and we were one of them and so you need them a little bit, but it doesn't stop markets from gapping out. We are not saying this is a terrible thing, just being very cautious about it. And we are always trying to be very cautious.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Speaking of cautious, the last one I have is on living wills. I know we have a little bit of time before we hear anything, but if you look at the comments from the previous year, what they wanted you all to address, it seems like there was a massive amount of progress made. I'm not sure what you can tell us, but curious your thoughts on progress made and then maybe timing on when we might hear regulators thoughts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I can tell you that obviously we took the feedback from the regulators as the industry did exactly as you would expect, entirely seriously; put loads of resources and effort to bear in making as much progress as we thought was humanly possible over the course of the period. And we feel that we made very, very -- I would agree with you; the industry, but JPMorgan specifically, made very, very significant progress in addressing the feedback between getting it and the July submission date. And obviously we feel like we have a credible plan.
That's not to say that we won't continue and some of our plans, and you saw it in some other disclosures. We are going to continue to work very hard at simplifying our legal entity structure over the next few years and interconnectedness and operational resiliency and all the things -- and reporting readiness, all the things that are going to make it even better.
So we think we made very, very significant progress. We think our plan is credible. We don't know exactly when we will get feedback, probably in the fall.

          And we respond to every single thing regulators raise with the huge resources to meet their needs. It will probably be iterative over time about they'll make more demands this year, etc. and --. By the way, I think there is a 50-page public part that you can actually read and it shows you. That's a 50-page summary of I think a 200,000 page detailed report.

          Marianne, you mentioned a couple of times about the competitiveness in the middle-market lending space. Can you give us some color on what you are seeing, whether it's underwriting standards, and what kind of product type in the middle market that is most competitive?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It's very broadly competitive and we compete obviously with big banks, regional banks, and non-banks. It's not that we are losing loans and deals most often on price. It's normally on size of holds or non-bank taking whole deals or on structures, but it's very, very competitive. Everybody likes the sector for growth and everybody likes -- so everybody is trying to make progress.
We are being very, very disciplined, and as a result of that, slightly lower growth than the industry average. And you might not always want us to always grow at the industry average. You want us to hold true to discipline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [79]

          Right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Remember, we looked at the whole relationship. I forgot the exact number, but if you look at the middle market relationship, I think something like half, maybe even a little bit less, of the revenues are from the lending.

          You guys have made great progress with the penetration of the mobile banking app that you've created as well as online banking. You showed us that your branch count is down over 100 branches on year-over-year basis. What do you see for the branches as you go forward? Is that trend line likely to continue as you continue with the increased penetration from the mobile app?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The way I would characterize it is we had a period of time following the Wampum merger where we were in new markets and we didn't have the right distribution footprint where we were building. We said about a year and a half ago that we felt like we had the right footprint as a macro matter, about 5,600, and that now we are around perfecting that, which is about consolidating certain branches where it makes sense but building new ones where makes sense. Consolidating them together where it makes sense.
You will see I think Gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years and that's probably still the right way to look at it, but it's really perfecting the network. Moving branches to the areas we like where there's a high density of affluence. And then, as you know, really looking at the nature of branches: so the footprint, the way we are using them, the way we are staffing them, importantly, moving them to more advice and less transaction, more automation.
Definitely responsive to the evolution in customer preferences. And mobile and online is not only a fantastic customer experience evidenced in our experience stat, but it's also a lower cost to serve, so we are also improving the profitability of the very highly transactional customers. I think Gordon used the word omnichannel. We have a place for everything in our suite and branches are very important. We're just going to be evolving them to continue to meet customer needs.

          I was just curious about the reduction of the non-operating deposits and I would have expected that to come mainly out of the corporate and investment bank. But when you look at the disclosures on your average asset level, it's essentially been $850 billion plus/minus each of the last five quarters. Where is the shrink really happening, or how do we see it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          In the non-operating deposits within the wholesale deposits, the majority is the CIB, but not quite two-thirds. And then you've got the commercial bank and you've got a little bit in asset management. So it is the majority of the number, but there are still sizable numbers, particularly in the commercial bank in the financial (inaudible) space.
And then, when you look at our overall balance sheet, you see cash going down because of the deposits. You see securities going down, but strong loan growth offsetting, and then small reductions in trading and secured financing.

          But when I look at total assets in the CIB, it's 845 this quarter versus 846 last year. It just doesn't look like a whole bunch came out of there. It looks like it all came out of the --.

Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [91]

          Well, if you go linked quarter it's 865 to 845. I'm just curious; it doesn't seem to mesh up to --.

Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [92]

          Well, we are getting more operating deposits, too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We talked about the deposit reduction is overachieving in non-op and improving mix in operating. So, trust me -- and I'm not looking at what you're looking at, so I do trust you -- but trust me that 60%-ish of it is CIB.

Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [94]

          Okay. When you see it in your public disclosures it all looks like it's coming out of corporate and other, which is down more than 100 linked quarter, so I was just kind of curious how it all works. Because if --.

Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just following up on the markets discussion. Curious whether or not you have seen some of the drama around Greece impact M&A discussions in Europe this quarter and maybe an update on the IB backlog at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The M&A -- we don't think Greece has affected the M&A dialogue very much, because it's been very active pretty much around the world. And when I say around the world, it's also like European companies coming to America and American companies going to Europe, etc., and those conversations continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A lot to Europe, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A lot to Europe, yes. So Greece had no real effect on that. Greece is a very, very small percent of the Eurozone in total, so economically it's not a driving factor for most of the companies there. Psychologically maybe it's going to affect some people, but I don't see why a company that has its own ambitions is going to change them because of Greece.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And would just -- with respect to the backlog, I would say it's very good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We did see a tremendous amount of something that we've almost never seen before, of American companies financing in euro because it was cheaper to do that, even if you swap back to dollars. So you saw a lot of American companies going to Europe to do that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Thanks for that. And then on security services, I know that you all highlighted that it's up quarter over quarter on the seasonal strength for the dividend season, but it was down year over year. Can you help us reconcile the year-over-year decline?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think if you go back to last quarter, Brennan, and take a look at the remarks from last quarter, we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the ADR business that drove a reduction, but just a classification issue. And then in addition we did lose a large client at the end of last year and that is having an impact. I think if you go back and look at the second quarter, hopefully that will make it clear.
And so the guidance, when we did those -- when we made that presentational change and obviously we talked about the client exit a few quarters ago, the guidance was, given those, we would expect the revenues to run between $950 million seasonally. And this is obviously a strong season and, therefore, it at through $950 million and $1 billion seasonally and, therefore, it's at the $1 billion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So Marianne gave you all very specific guidelines, which we don't normally do, on treasury services, investor services, and expenses in the commercial bank because a lot of you have your models wrong. And Sarah finds it very frustrating that you can't get it corrected quarter after quarter, so we've said here is the number that is actually our best guess. So, please, put it in your third- and fourth-quarter models.
And mortgage revenue was another one which has been ongoing to us. And what's the other one so we can just get it on the table whatever it is?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Jamie, you made a comment about attacking new markets and that sort of tags on to what I was going to ask, which is whether there are any of the old WaMu markets where you've not been able to expand as aggressively as you've wanted to and that you might be thinking about exiting. So I'm just wondering, can you just tell us how you feel about individual markets right now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Nancy, it's really important -- when we talk about these numbers, by the way, RWA and branches, we are not making commitments to anybody. That's our best guess knowing what we know today, but we reserve the right to change that on a moment's notice for whatever reason that makes sense for the Company and the clients.
And so branches -- it is very important that you look at branches city by city until you have the right footprint. So if you remember, the old A&P which never changed its locations and it never changed sizes and it failed. Any retail business should always be adding in new communities, subtracting in some; having the branches to adjust to a new reality, whether it's getting bigger or getting smaller.
In our case it's getting smaller, but again we are not getting smaller because we are guessing at this stuff. We are getting smaller because of the less need for operations and branches now. People are doing far more on mobile phones like that.
So we actually do it city by city. You don't set an overall guideline and say you have to do X, Y, or Z. It's city by city. And so, for the most part, in the WaMu footprint, I think Florida and California for the most part, city by city we went in and added what we thought we should have.
Wampum -- remember we also added on top of that small business, private banking, some middle-market, other businesses that WaMu wasn't even in. It was part of the expansion of those businesses, too. And so when I said a new city, I'm talking about what we've never really done -- I was talking about this way back to BankOne and the stocks when we did the merger with JPMorgan -- is going into a city de novo that we never been in. There you've got to look at how many branches you are going to open, how long is it going to take. And so we do want to do one of those and that will have nothing to do with WaMu because they are also places that WaMu wasn't.

Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Another geographic question. I get that Greece is not that important to the Eurozone and the events of the past couple weeks seem to have been a lot of theater, frankly. But the events in China in the last couple of weeks have been somewhat worrisome. Have your plans for China changed at all, given what seems to be a retreat from open markets there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No. I don't think there's been a retreat from open markets there either.
Remember, we've always said about China is you got to look and plan for the long run, which we do in all businesses. McKinsey has a report that shows that they are going to have 25% or so of some of the Fortune 1000 in I think it was 10 or 12 years. Enormous growth in their companies. Their companies are going overseas. Their companies are doing more M&A.
We did that one unique transaction where ChemChina bought Pirelli in Italy. Obviously, when we have a unique network, we can help a Chinese company and an Italian company at the same time, so we are building there for the long run.
As a risk management tool we've always said that the way we treat that is we will be prepared for very tough times and I think it's a mistake not to grow because you're going to have tough times. I have never seen an economy that didn't have tough times. If you went back to the United States, when J.P. Morgan was building JPMorgan back in 1850 and 1860, look every single time that you panic because America had a recession there would be no JPMorgan. So we are not going to change.
What we've seen with the officials in China is that they are very responsive to changes, and you can argue whether they should have gotten that involved in the stock market. You can't manipulate stock markets. But they are very responsive to lending.
They've changed their reserve policies, their RMB policies, the QFII policies, the Hong Kong Shanghai Connect. Not everything they do is going to work, but they still seem very committed to more and more market reform, more and more of taking SOE -- rationalization of SOEs and taking them public, so some market discipline there. Creating more of a consumer society.
And what we've always said -- and I think they have the wherewithal to meet their short-term objectives of growth, but we expect that they will have bumps in the road. We expect that and we are going to look right through that. The fact that their -- I also remember their market went from $4 trillion value -- so it's a $10 trillion economy. It went from $4 trillion market value to $10 trillion; now it's back to $6 trillion. I think those are the numbers.
The American stock market has done that roundtrip a couple times itself and so the American economy is $18 trillion. I think our stock market is $25 trillion, so there will still be huge opportunities there. If they ever completely reverse what they are talking about doing, you will see it in far more significant ways than them getting involved in the stock market.

Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just a quick follow-up. Marianne, earlier on you were talking about deposit betas and, for a lot of very good reasons, expecting that deposit betas will be a little bit faster this time around. But could you round out the conversation as to how you are thinking about how your NIM is going to traject in a rising rate scenario? Because I got a few questions on whether the deposit betas being a little faster means that the NIM trajectory is likely to be different from last time rates rose for you guys.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Marianne, you showed a NIM thing that NIM would go back to 265 to 275. And, remember, when we say deposit beta it is by product, by --and it's got gamma, so the first 25 basis points, the second are a different 25 basis points, they are different than the third 25 basis points. It's a pretty intensive analysis to try to get accurate; that's what we're trying to do. And it's all in that number that was presented and we don't think that's changed dramatically.
As Marianne said, we are assuming that whatever happened in the last cycle, this one will be worse. In other words, you will gather less of the benefit from rates going up than we have in the past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, because the last time rates rose your NIM didn't move up that much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Listen, there's a unique --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is a unique circumstance when you're at zero. There are a lot of things that happen when rates grow to 25 basis points that there will be -- you will pass very little of that also. And we also see that -- we will see that in money market funds. We will see that in some forms of deposits, etc.
The beta gets much higher as rates go up. If I had to guess, I would say we are conservative, not aggressive.

Unidentified Audience Member    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          This is actually Steve dialing in for Gerard. Just two follow-ups. You had mentioned the credit downgrades; I believe you said oil and gas. Were there any other sectors, and if there were, just some figures on them?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, the credit downgrades included oil and gas and we called it out just because in total oil and gas was $140 million of our total net $250 million reserve build. But also I said that there were select names, it's like a dozen names, so it's not really like there's another sector, just very discrete names.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, great. Thank you. And just a second follow-up. Can you just give us your mortgage duration and how far you are willing to take it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, we are not going to give you that. We disclose -- when you say mortgage duration, obviously we build into all of our models mortgage duration. You guys can calculate that yourself by looking at disclosures in the 10-K that show mortgages at 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, etc. And obviously we can change that at will with our investment portfolio and things like that.
It's all in the NIM already. So obviously we have negative convexity in our portfolio.

But Marianne has started to do such a good job that I've become unnecessary to be in all of them and I can obviously go do other things. So don't be surprised if one of these days I don't show up; don't read anything into it. Thank you for being here.
