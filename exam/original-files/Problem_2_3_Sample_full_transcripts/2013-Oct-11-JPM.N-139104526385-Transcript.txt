Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to JPMorgan Chase's third-quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. 
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time I'd like to turn the call over to JP Morgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. 
The firm made a net loss of $380 million for the third quarter, on the back of very significant litigation expenses, so I want to take you first to page 2. We've added this page for this quarter only as we want to be as transparent with you as we can be, and give you as complete a picture as possible of our litigation reserves, and a current perspective on the evolution of our reasonably possible range of losses in litigation. And as you know, as transparent as we would like to be, we are necessarily constrained in what we can actually say. 
Having said that on page 2, I'll start by saying that we appreciate the litigation expense of $9.2 billion is much more significant than you've been expecting. It's much more significant than we expected, until very recently. The reality is that over the last few weeks, the environment has become highly charged and very volatile. Things have been very fluid, and the situation escalated to the point where we're facing very large premiums and penalties, the level of which has gone far beyond what we reasonably expected; however, those are the facts we're dealing with today in our reserving actions this quarter and are trying as far as possible to put these issues behind us. 
So let me quickly take you through the table on the top of page 2, which is a roll forward of our reserves. We started 2010 with $3 billion in reserves, added around $28 billion through the third quarter, including the actions this period, and have settled a little less than $8 billion across matters, which leaves us with $23 billion approximately of  ending reserves, which relates to a broad range of matters, and includes a significant reserve for mortgage-related matters, including both securities and repurchase litigation exposure. Remember our GSE repurchase reserves of over $2 billion are separate from this. 
The balance at quarter-end reflects the $9.2 billion we're expensing this quarter. This expense also covers a range of matters, including but not limited to mortgage backed securities. And the impact to net income you can see is high, as it's being affected by a portion of the expense estimated to relate to enforcement penalties, which would not be tax deductible. Again, these estimates relate to a number of cases, including among other things, mortgage, as well as the recently-announced CIO settlements. We do expect litigation expenses to normalize over time to much lower levels, but they may be somewhat lumpy quarter over quarter. 
Finally on this page, we've included a table, which shows a revised range of reasonably possible losses, and those are losses that would be in addition to our reserves, and remember, it's pretax. It's very important to emphasize that when estimating this range, it's difficult, and there are significant inherent uncertainties and judgment required. As you can see, this was estimated at $6.8 billion last quarter, and while the range has gone down versus last quarter, its only gone down modestly in comparison to the reserve adds. 
Think of it simply as the estimate of what was reasonably possible back in the second quarter reflected our best assessment of the environment we were in, and our best judgment at that time. But as I said, we didn't, even a few weeks ago, reasonably expect things to have escalated to where they are now, so we have therefore revised our range to better reflect the reality of this current environment, with a range of up to $5.7 billion. Before we go back to page 1, just a final comment, as we said in the press release, the Board and senior management continues to seek fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage related issues, but at this time, we're unable to report on any specifics. 
So just flipping back to page 1, and just to finish off the front page, the other significant item we've highlighted on the page is the combined $1.6 billion of loan loss reserve releases for the consumer businesses, and if you add the two significant items in the table, which we don't consider to be core to our earnings, they total a loss of $6.2 billion, and $1.59 of EPS to the negative. If you adjust our results for these two non-core items, we would have earned $5.8 billion and an EPS of $1.42 with a return on tangible common equity of 15%, and that's not to discount the items, but rather to show the strength of our underlying performance. 
The businesses showed double-digit growth in key drivers, as well as market share gains in consumer and CIB, in banking and market. For the second consecutive year, we lead the nation in deposit growth, up 10%, credit card sales volumes were up 11%, and we maintained our number one IDC ranking, with 130 basis points increase in market share, and asset management saw $19 billion of long term net inflows, the 18th consecutive quarter. 
So turning with that to page 4 and the detail of  our balance sheet and capital. First, after allowing for dividends and repurchases, our capital declined in the quarter by approximately $2 billion. As a result, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio remained flat at 9.3% quarter over quarter, with a decline in capital being offset by lower risk-weighted assets, primarily driven by legacy portfolio run-off. We're targeting 9.5% by the end of this year, and still aiming to run at about a 50 to 100 basis point buffer above this level over time, and our 2014  CCAR submission will take both these targets into consideration, as well as maintaining the flexibility to increase dividends and to repurchase shares. And just a note, our Basel III ratio under the advanced approach is currently lower than under the standardized approach. 
An update then on leverage. The firm-wide supplementary leverage ratio under US rules remains at 4.7% this quarter, and similarly, the bank leverage ratio remains at 4.3%. And as you know, comment letters were provided recently relating to both the US NPR as well as Basel proposals, which included requests for revised treatment for certain assets and exposures, and we don't know what the outcome of the final rules will be, but it's possible there will be some things to improve those numbers. Finally, we remain compliant with LCR this quarter, and have HQLA of over $530 billion, with around $350 billion in cash at central banks. And as you know, we resubmitted our CCAR at the end of September, and expect to receive feedback from the Fed in early December. 
So now let's turn to business performance, and while the environment has been and continues to be very challenging, remember that there are more than 250,000 people in this Company focused day-in and day-out on serving our customers and communities. So with that on page 5 I'll start with Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.7 billion in net income for the quarter, on $11 billion of revenue, and with an ROE of 23%. As expected, we've seen a sharp drop in mortgage banking origination volumes and margins that's impacted noninterest revenue in the quarter. 
But taking a look at the franchise, we ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches, over 19,000 ATMs, and 1,900 Chase Private Client locations. And we continue to see really strong growth in the underlying drivers for the consumer businesses. Average deposits were up $40 billion year on year, an increase of 10% and for the second year in a row, we lead the FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth, and a growth rate more than twice the industry average, with that strength being broad based across markets. We're number one in our three largest markets and we gained share in 20 of the 25 largest markets. Our active mobile customer base grew by 30% year on year. 
We had record credit card sales volume of $107 billion, up 11% year on year, and outperforming the industry for the fifth consecutive year. This quarter also had record client investment assets of $179 billion, up 16% year on year, reflecting strong positive momentum of the Chase Private Client initiative, as well as overall higher market levels. And to close a moment on expenses, which were down $89 million year on year primarily due to lower mortgage banking expenses, and across CCB, we will have reduced headcount by over 15,000 for the full year of 2013. 
Turning to page 6, consumer and business banking. Generated net income of $762 million, and an ROE of 27% on net revenue of $4.4 billion, up 2% year on year, and 3% quarter on quarter. Net interest income is up 3% quarter on quarter, driven by the strong growth in deposits I mentioned, partially offset by spread compression. But for the first time in about three years, the deposit margin has not declined quarter over quarter, meaning that rate compression is being offset by higher reinvestment rates. And at current market rates we would expect, all other things being equal, for our deposit margin to be relatively stable in the medium term. 
On the noninterest revenue side, we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue. Expenses are up year on year, reflecting the investments we've made in the business, including Chase Private Client, as well as costs related to strengthening control and compliance. In a minute on business banking, you can see loan balances are flat quarter over quarter, up 2% versus last year, and production levels have stabilized at around these levels with a healthy pipeline in that context. 
Turning to page 7 and the mortgage bank. Overall mortgage banking net income was around $700 million, with an ROE of 14%. And the short story here is significantly lower production income offsetting higher reserve releases, but if you start at the top with production pretax, we guided you that production pretax margins would be slightly negative in each of the third and fourth quarters. Excluding repurchases, you can see that's the case for  the third quarter, with a net loss of $85 million or a net negative 21 basis points of pretax margin. As you see, revenues are down over 50% quarter on quarter. This reflects both a reduction in lots, and the impact of a mix change, together driving 120 basis points of revenue margin compression in the quarter. While lots were down 40%, quarter on quarter closed loan volumes were down 17%, reflecting a pull through of the second-quarter pipeline. 
And although you do see that our expenses are down some, around 7%, this reflects primarily the transaction level variable costs. We have taken appropriate actions this quarter to adjust capacity, which will fully hit our run rate and exit Q4. On the positive side, our purchase volumes continue to increase and purchase mix was nearly 50% of loans this quarter, up from 35% last quarter. 
Moving on to servicing, a loss of $226 million pretax excluding MSR risk management. Lower revenues were down due to a couple of items, including the exit of lender place reinsurance. While on an adjusted basis, the servicing revenue would have been up slightly, reflecting the impact of higher rates. Also, servicing expenses were $858 million for the quarter, including approximately $200 million of foreclosure-related matters. If you adjust for this, our core expenses would have been around $650 million, on track for approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as we guided at Investor Day. Finally, you see the MSR showed a modest loss this quarter of $180 million, which includes a negative $120 million due to further HPI improvement, which is also driving higher reserve releases in the real estate portfolios. 
So on to the real estate portfolio, pretax income of $1.5 billion includes net charge-offs of a little over $200 million, with charge-offs expected at around that same level next quarter. As expected, a continued reduction in delinquencies, but importantly improvement in HPI drove severity down in both NCI and PCI portfolios, which led us to release a combined $1.25 billion of reserves this quarter. 
Turning the page to page 8, will be card, merchant services, and auto. Revenue of $4.6 billion was down slightly year on year and quarter on quarter, as a result of spread compression, despite strong sales volumes. With net income of $1.2 billion, up 29% year on year, and an ROE of 26%, excluding reserve releases, which reflects strong and consistent growth in sales and interchange revenue. 
In card, year over year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes, was consistent and strong, at 11% and 14%, respectively, and we saw a slight increase in average outstandings quarter on quarter. Expenses are flat year over year, and down a little quarter over quarter, but the second quarter included a one-time item. The net charge-off rate has reached historic lows at 2.86%, which is down over 70 basis points year on year, and we released $350 million of loan loss reserves this quarter. We expect an additional $150 million of reserve releases next quarter, consistent with our guidance for the second half of the year. Before we move on, a few things on auto, with originations up 2% year on year, and balances 4% year on year. And despite higher rates leading to increased competitive intensity, we are still expecting growth in the fourth quarter year over year. 
Moving on to slide 9, the corporate & investment bank. We had very strong performance in CIB, with net income of $2.2 billion and an ROE of 16%, despite being a seasonally weaker third quarter and including a DDA loss of nearly $400 million. As usual, we'll focus on the numbers, excluding DDA. We had net income of $2.5 billion on revenues of $8.6 billion, and an ROE of 17%. In banking, total revenue was $2.9 billion, and we maintained our number-one ranking in global IB fees with $1.5 billion, up 6% year on year. We were up in a market that is down overall in wallet, and captured 130 basis points of wallet share over last year. Our market share gains were significantly larger than any of the other top 10 players, and supported by landmark transactions like Verizon. 
I'll take a second to just give you some color on the strong competitive performance in ECM this quarter. We're number one year-to-date in terms of wallet, gaining 140 basis points a share, and this quarter, we're number one in volume, number one in wallet, and number one in deals. 
Moving on to markets, $4.7 billion of revenue, down 2% year on year, versus a strong third quarter last year, in line with our guidance that we provided at Barclays. Fixed income markets revenue of $3.4 billion was down 8% year on year, but remember, the third quarter of 2012 did include modest losses in the synthetic credit portfolio. Equity markets revenues of $1.2 billion were up 20% year on year, with broad based strength across cash and derivatives and across regions. Security service revenue of $1 billion was up 3% year on year, with growth in custody and fund services, partially offset by lower agent lending spreads. And credit adjustments and other have a negative $409 million, with almost entirely DDA. 
Expenses of $5 billion were down 7% year on year, primarily driven by comp, with a comp to revenue ratio of 27% for the quarter. Loans were down slightly primarily due to trade finance, and finally, average CIB VaR remained relatively flat quarter over quarter, at $45 million. The current quarter continues to reflect historically low levels of volatility, as well as continued risk reduction. 
I'll skip page 10 and take you to page 11 and the commercial bank. The quarter saw net income of $665 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were flat year on year and quarter on quarter, reflecting pressure on NII, offset by favorable franchise trends. Spreads compressed in the quarter 5 basis points or so, from the relatively stable landscape in the last few quarters across most client segments and geographies, and given the environment, it's likely spreads will continue to be under some pressure. 
In terms of loan balances of $135 billion, up 9% year on year, and 3% quarter on quarter. This remains a tale of two cities. The commercial real estate business continues to grow strongly, up 4% quarter on quarter with loan growth outpacing the market and growing every month for the last 13 months. Multi-family fundamentals are very strong and traditional commercial real estate is building momentum, with both CRE and multi-family pipelines remaining robust. However in C&I, demand remains soft and competitive pressures high, the combination of which has continued to drive relatively flat C&I loans in the quarter, and we continue to focus on quality over growth. Every day we're adding new quality clients, clients with whom we expect to do lots of business over decades to come, and we've added over 600 of these clients year-to-date. 
And aside from lending, we continue to cross-sell our existing clients, so evidence that growth IB revenues were a record $448 million for the quarter, up 16%. Before we leave CB, two final points. Expenses were up 10% year over year reflecting higher products and headcount expenses as we invest in front office and controls, and credit reflected a relief this quarter as the risk profile of the portfolio continues to improve. 
Page 12 and asset management. Another very strong quarter for asset management, with net income of $476 million, up 7% year on year, and an ROE of 21%. Revenue was $2.8 billion, up 12% over last year, and while overall higher market levels did help, very strong fund performance and flows drove the story. 74% of our Mutual Fund AUM is ranked in the first or second quartiles of performance over five years, and we saw $19 billion of long term net inflows. This is the 18th consecutive quarter of long term net inflows. Importantly, we saw this in every single long term asset class from every region, and it's brought our year-to-date long term flows to $74 billion, which compares to just less than $60 billion for the full year of 2012. 
We ended the quarter with AUM of $1.5 trillion, up 12% year on year, and in banking, we continued to see deposit and loan growth across-the-board. And while we expect loan growth to continue to be relatively strong, it's likely to be somewhat lower in Q4, given the lower mortgage pipeline. Expenses increased 16% year on year as we continue to grow and invest in client advisors, and looking forward, we expect long term flows to remain positive, and the breadth of our platform to enable us to grow our business and continue to sustain strong trends. 
Moving on to page 13, corporate and private equity. A total net loss of $6.5 billion for the quarter, but breaking it down into its constituent pieces, private equity generated net income of $242 million, reflecting gains on certain investments in our $9 billion portfolio. Treasury and CIO showed a net loss of around $200 million, but you'll see that the $261 million of negative NII this quarter is lower than the run rate seen over the last several quarters, which reflects the impact of higher rates, specifically higher yields quarter over quarter, driven by mortgages and reinvestment in munis. 
In the quarter we deployed $32 billion gross in new investments, primarily agency mortgages and munis, including $5 billion of agency mortgages, which we've classified as held to maturity. As we continue to reinvest, if you follow the forward curve, you should expect NII to continue to improve the CIO Treasury over the next several quarters. And finally, although AOCI ended up relatively flat quarter over quarter, or even up slightly, we did obviously see significant volatility during the quarter. 
The other corporate net loss of $6.5 billion is driven by the $9.2 billion pretax or $7.2 billion aftertax for litigation expense in the quarter. If you exclude litigation, results for the quarter did include a few positive tax adjustments totaling around $500 million, relating to prior period adjustments, settlements, resolutions and reserve changes, mostly BAU items. 
So finally, page 14 and our outlook. We've covered most of the outlook going through the presentation, but just a couple of things I would highlight. As expected, our firm-wide NIM, core NIM, and NII were relatively flat this quarter, and given market rates, we expect relatively flat NIM and NII in the near term. The Firm is positioned to benefit from a higher rate environment, and we are starting to see that in our results. 
Turning to expenses, we expect adjusted expenses in the full year to be between $59.5 billion and $60 billion, as we continue to invest in controls and compliance. Overall our businesses are delivering in terms of leadership growth and financial performance, with double digit growth in key business drivers, as well as market share gains. And as I said, excluding corporate litigation and releases, we returned a 15% return on tangible common equity. I'll hand it over to Jamie who will go through the final slide.

Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great, Marianne. Thank you very much and hello everybody. So I'm going to just talk a little bit about things on page 15, because a lot of questions were getting asked about it. 
It's the three columns, I'll do each one shortly. First, simplifying our business. If you look at what we're doing, we're spinning off one equity partner, selling physical commodities and we closed down a bunch of business lines. I think it's a core business principle to always simplify your business, and to focus on where you can really win. It's a little more amplified this time, because obviously there's a new regulatory environment, capital, and we need to focus a lot of our management mindset on controls. You also, on that first column, you see we're derisking. We're trying to meet new standards we set for ourselves and the regulators wanted to set, to reduce risk to our Company, particularly on anti-money laundering. It will have a revenue effect, so my guess is if you ask, probably a couple hundred million dollars across all of our businesses. 
The middle column shows you the investments we're making in control. We want to be best-in-class. We want to get to Six Sigma. Its become the number one priority. Just give you an idea, we're going to spend about $1 billion more, and but that's not the effort. The real effort to think about is how much resource we directed to get this right, and there are unprecedented work streams, like 500 people working on CCAR, 500 people working on resolution recovery, we just turned in, a believe it or not 100,000 page plan. We've added 5,000 people, and so this is a permanent investment, these costs aren't going to go away, and it's important we get this exactly right. 
If you look at the right-hand column, I want to go down that one by one. So I just mentioned it is permanent cost structure will stay in place, but our overhead is very competitive, we're very rigorous in expenses, and we intend to stay that way. So you shouldn't expect to see tremendous increase in our expense base. While we simplified our business, it does not really affect our core businesses, our core products, so Marianne went through the four business lines, it's not going to affect our ability to be extremely competitive. Our fortress balance sheet is intact, and as you know, critically important to us. The high levels of capital liquidity will ultimately affect pricing to clients, but we'll also be able to push down and optimize across the globe effectively, as we adjust to the new global financial architecture. 
I think it's important to point out that we do have to adjust to a new global financial architecture. It's not just the consentor, there's really rules around the world. We're working hard to do that. We think we will be able to do that, but we go into that with excellent franchises, good underlying growth, and a pretty good long term outlook, because while we operate in violent and volatile businesses around the world, markets go up and down, the underlying growth of asset management, equity, debt, capital markets, global multi-nationals, US consumer needs, middle market needs in the US, will be growing over time. So we think we're in a very good place to serve them. 
Our people really have done an outstanding job persevering and performing through these difficult times, and you can go back and say its been over five or six years. If you came to the building, I know a lot of you have, you see the employee morale is very high, and hopefully will stay there. 
And then the last thing, at Investor Day, since a lot of new rules, they won't be completely finalized but we'll know most of them, we'll be able to give you a lot more of an update on how we think this affects our businesses going forward. We're pretty optimistic we'll be able to continue to build a great Company. So we'll stop there, and open the floor to questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Operator Instructions) 
Our first question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just on the legal front, not sure exactly what you can say, I'll give it a shot here. Does the lack of a settlement so far with the government reflect the DC shutdown, or more the fact that you're still negotiating, or a combination of both, any comment there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think it may be a little bit the DC shutdown, but in reality, it's a complex thing. It's a Board level issue and we want a fair and reasonable settlement, if we can. And that's all we can really say about it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It involves multiple agencies, so you can imagine the complexity. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and in terms of the $9 billion provision this quarter, can you give us any sense of how much that reflects revised estimates of government penalties and fines, as opposed to refined estimates for damage claims from private parties and things like that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, John. Unfortunately, we did as much as we can, give you as much clarity as we can, but we aren't going to be able to break that down for you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you give one more shot, Marianne explaining how the range of possible loss doesn't go down more after such a big provision? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so John, the way to think about it, very candidly, is that we didn't expect when we estimated that -- remember it's a very difficult thing to estimate, there's significant uncertainty in terms of the estimate, significant judgment. And when we made those judgments in the second quarter, we didn't anticipate the environment being as volatile and escalating to the point that it has now. So as we have taken our reserves, and the reserves reflect today, so it reflects the current environment and the situation in fact that we're in, and we've now taken that into consideration as we look forward with our reasonably possible range. That's why it hasn't gone down anywhere near dollar to dollar, obviously. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and one more thing on this, does the settlement, negotiations, and things that you're doing does that affect how you project losses on other aspects of legal that you were not negotiating in the last couple weeks? So you've upped the projection of what you might face on other stuff? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All we can say, John, is that we reserve for what's equitable, based on the facts and circumstances specific to each individual exposure, and the overall environment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's a tough environment, John. We're just trying to reflect that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, on the expense front, I guess Jamie just said that the things you've added in the control and compliance area are permanent, and that drove up the expense outlook on adjusted basis, Marianne of $59.5 billion to $60 billion, so this is this the go-forward run rate? The $60 billion adjusted expenses, what would be the opportunities to bring that down over time, is there any areas where that is still environmentally elevated? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So just two things, John, and I think in the Barclays presentation there was a slide that showed that of the increase in our outlook, there was a chunk of it that related to non-core prep litigation, so it certainly isn't entirely to do with our investment in cost and control, much of which we are funding through efficiencies. Having said that, there is an incremental cost. It is in part permanent, and it's going to be reflected in our run rate, but there was a good, I think $500 million is my recollection of other expenses including non-corporate litigation, which as you know, we don't adjust out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then also in there would be the default servicing, which is still elevated. Can you remind us what the longer term target and how that could come down? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so the longer term target was a $325 million quarterly run rate, but that's over the longer term. What we said about 2013 and are on track to deliver is that we would exit the year with about $600 million of expenses in the fourth quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Which we still expect. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Which is expected. So if you look at the third quarter run rate adjusted, it's about $650 million, down from just over $700 million in the second quarter, so that trend is moving in the right direction. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then the last thing for me is just wondering, Jamie Dimon, did the internal control issues this year and some of the headliners at regulators, does that affect your mindset as you go into CCAR and think about how you'll think about capital return next year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So first of all, we're going to get there when we get there, but obviously, this Company is very sound, plenty of capital. We want to pass CCAR, but when you talk about capital plans, it's going to be subject to several things. One is the stock price, subject to passing CCAR with flying colors, which is really the stress test of CCAR, and also subject to wanting to meet our own targets for capital. So we've already said we want to get probably something North of 10% Basel III Tier 1 capital, et cetera and when we know all those numbers, do our budgets, we'll put the proper CCAR plan in place. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thanks.

    Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just a quick follow-up on the CCAR. You had mentioned the difference, well you didn't say the exact difference between advanced and standardized, but I wonder if you could shed light on the spread between the two. And I'm just curious, does it play a bigger role in the process this year, or you were just pointing it out? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I was pointing out mainly, Glenn, because I think if you go back several quarters over a year ago, standardized for us was lower than advanced by a reasonable spread, and clearly, when the common [store] amendment is applicable, which is not for a period of time, we would be looking at the lower of those two ratios. Right now, it's higher than the advanced approach, by a little more than 10 basis points. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We should put out when we do CCAR next year, effectively, it's not the same for every quarter, but effectively, it will be based on Basel III, which is a former volatile number because RWA moves around under stress under Basel III, as opposed under Basel I. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, but I mean that spread is a lot tighter, so it's less concerning so it's good. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, curious, we don't have all of the answers on how the whole leverage focus is going to shake out but it seems I'm putting a little words in your mouth, but it seems to be working its way through a little bit. I think your book's down 15% or so year on year, and it's less than 10% of the overall balance sheet. But is that a correct way to think about it,  that focus is going to start impacting the repo market? And I'm just curious if you could talk about for your book, what is balance sheet financing versus real customer financing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so SLR, which I think you're referring to is 4.7%, remember that would go up by 50 basis points if you just subtracted the cash we hold at central banks. So until final rules come out I wouldn't overreact to it. Obviously SLR, it causes you to optimize differently, and a lot of products which are very high user capital under SLR, think of those as deposits, repo, and any of the short-term and low margin, revolvers et cetera. 
So it will make you optimize differently, but I think in reality the way we look at it is, we'll be able to adjust to it, we'll probably be able to do it by client. We're going to get to the ratio we need to get to, and we want to do it without disrupting all of our clients. So we will be able to give you more detail when we know the final roles. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And remember, Glenn, there is still the possibility there will be changes made to reflect I think the FIN41, which you're talking about, which I think would be positive for the repo market. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, understood, shifting gears just a quickie. So the guidance is for flat net interest income dollars, and the loan growth was 1% or 2%, quarter on quarter and year on year, but the underlying business, as you mentioned are a lot better. Just curious, it seems like conservative guidance, but curious on what is behind it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So on NII, Glenn? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Correct. In terms of NII dollars being flat. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So yes, I mean, growth has flattened out in terms of interest earning assets, you seen that obviously take place over the last couple of quarters, and so our guidance is reflecting the fact that we have seen things stabilize, both NIM and NII, and that further near term that's what we're expecting. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, maybe a last one. In a world that doesn't have a lot of loan growth, has very low interest rates and Capital Markets have been far from ideal to your point, your businesses, underlying business or operating goods. And extra charge, you're earning at that $6 run rate that people are hoping you could get to.  I guess the question is, do you have more confidence than you did last year in terms of that $24 billion over the cycle, because you're at that run rate now with not ideal conditions. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Listen, it's your job to forecast the future. We do think that it's very good businesses, and like I said, it's underlying growth, but obviously it could be swamped in the short run by markets and events, et cetera. We'll provide a lot more in Investor Day, and give you much more insight. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, I have more confidence. Thanks, Jamie, Bye.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A couple questions. One on, just another question on FIC. We've talked in the past about clearing and clearing requirements, and prior quarters we just had very few trades coming in under the new rules. Could you give us a sense as to how customer behavior has been, and how that's impacted your FIC line this quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So, I think there's two major things. First of all, the pre trade and post trade rules are in place, and basically they didn't have that much of effect on the business. And now you have the steps in place, and from talking to folks on the trading floor, volumes seem to be down a little bit, but not because of the steps. 
The steps are basically accepting data at this point. They are not effectively making mortgage yet, so you haven't seen a huge effect of it. And I think over time, it still remains to be seen. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then on SLR, did I hear you correctly that  you aren't going to make any changes to how you're providing credit to clients, until you find out what the final rule is? There's no major changes on how you're approaching the market? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, because we'll meet the new targets and retain the capital, and eventually, we are actually already pushing down to the business. We're sorting to push down to the business units SLR, all the capital, all the stuff. Eventually, I mean LCR, eventually we'll put down SLR, and that will affect pricing and stuff. 
What we don't want to do is do a lot of anticipation, but if revolvers stay at SLR at 100% drawn, the cost will go up.   I'm not sure they will go up immediately but they will go up over time so we'll be able to get there. We just don't want to do stupid things in anticipation of rules, which we don't know what they are yet. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Betsy, our businesses are thinking through all of the implications. When the rules come out, we'll be able to act, but think about it as a measured approach. We don't want to overreact. We want to see how things play out, and at the margin, there will be changes to products and pricing but we'll be very measured. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So cash at central banks doesn't have to hold capital against, that's 50 basis points. If you took revolvers down to what we say is a normal draw, like even a stress draw of 20% which is what we saw in the crisis, there will be another 50 basis points, so we just want to be a little measured in how we deal with this. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then second thing on mortgage, in the mortgage servicing, relatively high charges, the foreclosure piece in there, but just wondering if there's anything else going on in the servicing expenses? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, Betsy, this is really just the basic underlying run rate, which is about $650 million. Which does include some severance obviously, given actions taken to adjust capacity in the business, together with the $200 million item, which relates to foreclosure, it's nothing else. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and portfolio sale coming up at all in that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, not anything of any significance. We have done some, but nothing major. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then just lastly, just another question on the litigation on the page 2. I think the Street understands the reason for taking the $9 billion charge, and I see here you've got the two comments on page 2 which highlight that unpredictable, hard to forecast. But I guess what some folks are wondering is, should we be putting into the model just higher run rate of litigation expenses going forward, I think over the past couple years its been $300 million to $500 million normalized quarter, $1 billion to $2 billion, on a top and up quarter. Is that $1 billion to $2 billion the new normal until we get through this whole thing or--? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We would love to reduce the uncertainty around this for ourselves and for you, but it's very hard to do. So the way I'd look at it is it will probably be elevated for the next year or two, not like we just went through, but it will necessarily be lumpy. So it might be as we settle, as we negotiate, as  we figure out -- remember there are multiple agencies involved in every case now, so you saw in the CIO that we paid four, maybe eventually five penalties, which we really did not expect. So we just have to deal with it and deal with the reality that it is. It will abate over time, and the underlying power of the Company you can see, so-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I wish I could give you a better answer, but one day, it won't be a big number. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So Jamie, as you think about all of the litigation stuff that you've got, can you give us a sense as to how much you're currently in discussions to negotiate? I mean, to give us a sense of how far along you think you are? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I think you have to look at first of all, the big ones are really Board-level type of discussions and we -- our preference is always to resolve it. It is very hard to fight with your regulators or the Federal Government, but we want them to be fair and reasonable. We have shareholders, and those shareholders, by the way, I remind people, it's not me. It's veterans or retirees and mothers and we're trying to do the right thing. It's very hard. We've got the top people involved inside and outside the Company, and hopefully over time, we will make this a much smaller issue. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just looking at slide 15, I think it's very helpful in terms of laying out some of the things that you're targeting to reduce in the left hand side. I guess as we step back to the picture and we think about a couple hundred million of revenue you gave up on the left side, some expense pick up in the middle, and then we factor in the higher capital requirements, the higher liquidity, are you confident that both the long-term earnings impact won't be that meaningful, and that you don't need to adjust the model that much? And I think that's most people's view but the nickels and times, I think there's some concern that it does start to add up as well. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well it does, but again, we think we've maintained pretty good margins and pretty good capital, and we have different ways to optimize. And not all of the things we're simplifying were very profitable, and so remember, let's just focus on other things and the other things we're doing pretty well. Like almost every single business, we're up in share. And remember, the reason you go up in share is because you're doing a good job for clients. They vote with their feet, which means you're satisfying them. 
So we're comfortable we'll be able to adjust to the new world and still have great businesses, and again, you haven't seen all of the repricing that might take place, you haven't seen the reactions and change in business strategies, and some things may move to the shadow banking world, which is fine. We'll figure it out. Like I mentioned, the needs of our clients, consumer, small business, middle market, large corporate, are not going away. They have to be served and satisfied somewhere. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just separately the compensation rate within the investment bank coming down this quarter, despite pretty good revenue trends overall, any additional color on that? I think you've been targeting 35% longer term, and we're maybe 31% or so. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We've said 30% to 35%, and remember we do it pretty consistently after capital, and looking at value created, stuff like that so that hasn't changed, just came down a little this quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Lastly could you just share what the CIO losses were a year ago? I'm not sure if you disclosed that before? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We said there were modest loss last year (multiple speakers)  and they were about breakeven this quarter, and it's getting very small. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from [Erica Najerian] of Bank of America. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erica Najerian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    My first question is on the new leverage proposals.  I think we're hearing loud and clear that you're not going to do anything rash in terms of how you run your businesses, but given that we're still in proposal form in the US and also with Basel, can JPMorgan accelerate capital return in next year's CCAR, even with these proposals fluid on the leverage side? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Erica, two things. One is, if you just look at the firm wide leverage ratio for a second that 4.7%, obviously that maybe changes when the final rules are issued, but just take that as a base. We're only 30 basis points from the minimum and while we're targeting to go higher than that, clearly 30 basis points is not a great distance for us to cover. 
And then I'd just reiterate what Jamie said, which is when we look at our 2014 CCAR, it will take into account a balanced set of facts and circumstances, so obviously both the quantitative and qualitative nature of the results of the stress test, but also our desire to want to get to capital levels that we've expressed, together with maintaining flexibility to do appropriate dividends and repurchases. So all those things together will be considered in the capital plan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erica Najerian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And my second follow-up question is on the advanced versus standardized approach, as it relates to the CCAR. You've told us that the standardized ratio is clearly lower, but as you run your models under stress, what is more punitive for your bank? Is it coming into a stress scenario with a lower starting point on standardized, or is it the RWA inflation, when you stressed the advanced? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So three things, just to clarify. Currently our standardized ratio is higher than advanced, albeit not by very wide margin, so just to clarify that point. Just generically, the advanced approach RWA sensitivity to a stress environment would be more impacted than a standardized approach, but remember, that's a 2014, that's a future issue for us. 
The 2014 CCAR, as we understand the instructions, we will be looking at an additional test on top of the 5% Basel I, that will have a Basel I risk weighted assets for the denominator for the first four quarters, and Basel III standardized for the second four quarters. So it's a 2014 CCAR, the advanced approach isn't one of the critical tests, although it will likely be in the future. But in theory and in reality, that will reduce more dramatically on the stress than the other measure. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erica Najerian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it, thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Three small questions and one larger one. First, what was the loan utilization on the wholesale side for the quarter versus last quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It was relatively flat, Mike, in the low 30s, between 30% and 31%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And as far as the headcount reduction, you said in CCB you're taking up 15,000 jobs this year and 11,000 in mortgage? Where are the rest of the jobs coming out from, and how are you able to do that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's consistent with what we said at Investor Day, in terms of the remaining jobs turning out of the branch networking consumer, as we implement new technology and new operating models, and new branch formats. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and as it relates to slide 15, the repositioning of the business, what inning are you in for that derisking and the control agenda? It seems like the derisking might be earlier innings, and the control agenda the later stages but you tell me. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I guess we're making huge progress on it, but it's not going to stop for years. It's permanent. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then the larger question relates to the legal issue. How much of the investor losses for the mortgage putback and the mortgage securities relate to Bear? I know there's been a lot of numbers in the press, but we haven't heard those numbers from you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So Mike, just what it's worth on page 2, very small in the footnote, we talk about that estimate of about 80% of MBS deal losses related to heritage investments. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And what's the dollar-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's losses. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, 80% of the losses? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And what's the dollar amount of losses on the mortgage putback side? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When you saw mortgage putback, are you talking about the GSE putback? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well what's the total dollar amount of all of the losses we're talking about the potential settlement? That must be public somewhere, for mortgage putback in aggregate, the mortgage securities, what are the dollar amounts of the original, what's the original principal amount, and what's the investor loss? Just the dollar amounts if you can break that down. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think have you to get that from other analysts who actually have published numbers like that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I guess one question, it's 80% of the losses are from the deals, would you have done the deals differently? Did you not read the fine print? Did you not have some additional protection that you might have had? I know it was short notice for these transactions. On the other hand as you look back now maybe you wish you did something differently? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think -- obviously, that's true, Mike, so because this is very painful for the Company, and so Bear Sterns we did do quickly. We didn't anticipate that we would be paying anything for prior losses for Bear Sterns. I tell people, even the Bear Sterns number, I think it was $80 billion of bonds were made good which would have failed that day, had they gone bankrupt. 
And we did ask, we weren't completely stupid. We did ask the SEC for and only the SEC for would they please agree not to take enforcement actions against JPMorgan against things that happened at Bear, which of course they couldn't do outright, but they did say they would take into consideration the circumstances in which the transaction took place. 
And in WaMu, we don't believe we're responsible by contract. But that does not mean that people can't come after you. So that was a little bit of a lesson learned too. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you talk more about the trade-off? Nobody is forcing you to sell off. If you really think this is a bad deal, then you obviously wouldn't do it so what's the trade-off of not settling versus settling? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're going to do what's in the best interest of our shareholders, all things considered, it's a Board level decision. And it needs to be fair, reasonable, taking consideration all of the facts and have some possible -- we would like to get it done, and if we can't, that's the Board will make that decision. It's not a good choice either way. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [91]

    And your decision to disclose the legal reserve, as we go back and asking all the other banks, what's your legal reserve, JPMorgan disclosed it, why don't you? What were the factors that led you to do that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike, the factor there was candidly that you were all trying to do this, you had most, or at least a large number of analysts that published research papers trying to recreate settlements and reserves three times, and for this one time only, we felt like it was helpful and transparent and constructive to show you the magnitude of reserves after these actions. So that you can have that context when you think about the future.

    Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. First of all Marianne, in the expenses related to mortgage production, those were down about 6% quarter over quarter. Do you have a sense as to if the trajectory of those costs are going to come down faster over the next couple of quarters? Several banks have discussed that in terms of trying to reduce the expenses, at the same time production revenues are also coming down. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so first of all just to give context to that 6% to 7% down quarter over quarter, there is a portion of our expense base related to mortgage that's truly variable, so as production levels go down, we pay less compensation on the loans, and as a result, that's what you're seeing in this quarter. With respect to then rightsizing the expense base for the opportunity in the market, we have taken actions, as you have are aware in the third quarter, to start to do that; however, once you go beyond the truly variable costs, those actions take some four, or cases six months to truly get to the run rate. 
So while we would expect to see that start to come to fruition in the fourth quarter, not completely in the quarter, more as a run rate matter. And then there is a portion of costs that are more fixed, in terms of our ability to be able to participate, whether it's real estate technology and a core infrastructure. We are obviously also taking a look at that, but we are in this business, and so there will be an element of fixed costs into obviously next year. 
But you should expect that we're still seeing, absent lots go down slightly into the fourth quarter, so you should expect revenues will maybe be down, but expenses will also be down, for that net slight negative pretax margin that we've guided you to. That's still what we expect. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's helpful and then just a question on pipelines. You mentioned that the pipeline in commercial banking was healthy. Just curious as to whether or not that is largely due to transactions that have been held up because of uncertainty in the economy on the part of your borrowers, or is that also being helped by more business being booked by your bankers? And also if you have a comment on the investment banking pipeline at this point, realizing it's early in the quarter, that would be helpful too. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Let me brag on our commercial bank and investment bank bankers And they've opened up branches I want to say Jacksonville, Sacramento, Nashville, so we're actually in more places in the commercial bank. Obviously, we've been building in the WaMu footprint in Florida and California, they've been doing an exceptional job. 
And more importantly a high quality job, like we're really happy with the quality of the business we're booking. And our Investment Bankers you see the numbers in equity and debt and we didn't mention all of the deals that we are involved in but Verizon, and Sprint, and Nokia, there's good pipelines and good traffic. You know that can change tomorrow, but the fact is, we are satisfying our clients and we're thrilled with the business we're generating. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then just Jamie maybe a question on the buyback. At this point it doesn't sound like you have any concerns about the litigation expenses in this quarter being an issue for the CCAR submission, or future buyback trends, is that what I heard? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So we don't expect or believe there should be any repercussions, but ultimately that's the regulators' decision so we resubmitted CCAR in September. We're still waiting for feedback. We get feedback in early December. We will do a good, thoughtful and appropriate job of thinking through our capital asks as we do the 2014 CCAR, so those will be the things that we do. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And we're doing very little stock buyback right now. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [102]

    Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You mentioned in passing that at the Investor Day in February, you think that there will be a lot more of the rules in place that you'll be able to discuss the impact of.  I was wondering the specific ones that you think will be available by then, Volker for example, is it your understanding that you'll have a good understanding by then? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, Volker, more detail on SLR, more detail on how much long term debt, I think we have almost 20% of available resources today. And then you could look at things very basic and simple and say okay, well if the cost is a little bit higher and pricing stays the same and capital is higher, returns a little bit lower, that's true. But that doesn't take into consideration things we don't know which is repricing, competitor strategies, and our ability to optimize by client, by state, by region, by product 
So all those things, we just give you a better idea. We're very comfortable we've got a very good business, but we'll give you a better idea of what we think it means by business. For example, we're going to allocate more capital and operating capital to the businesses, we'll ask them to optimize on SLR, and without damaging the client franchise, but we just will give you more detail. That's all. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. One thing that you alluded to a couple of times this morning is the idea of the SLR being maybe 50 basis points higher, if you didn't have to carry capital, or count into the leverage exposure. You were deposits with central banks. Since you mentioned it a couple times, does that mean that you actually have a reasonably high degree of comfort that there will be an exemption for that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, I think that a lot of people mentioned that they think it was inappropriate to apply capital to that, but the regulators will decide, whatever it is, we will be able to adjust to and conform to the rules. I would just point out that some of these things can move that number quite a bit and there's a reason why you shouldn't overreact to it and just take the time and do it right. We know the final rules, we will conform. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We conform very quickly, so it's just why would you conform very quickly and disrupt clients? So just think of it that way. We're trying to do the right thing to the client base and the Company. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We don't want to restrict, we could go out tomorrow and say we aren't going to make anymore revolvers, and we will be there very quickly. We just don't want to do that. It's not a rational way to run a business. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure, that's completely fair. At this year's Investor Day, you identified in the investment bank a $65 billion run-off portfolio that you gave some targets of reduction for, at year-end. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I've also noticed that in your Pillar 3 disclosures you've got a very high CRM, which I have to assume is associated with correlation book stuff, which I guess that run-off portfolio is. Can you give us a sense for whether that's right, and where you are with that run-off portfolio? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are going to meet our targets through the run-off portfolio, which will cause a couple of things. Part of the CRM was a synthetic credit portfolio, which is, I'll say, 1/10 of the size it was a year ago and I don't remember the exact numbers, and we're still going to be optimizing across other products. There's certain things in mortgages that use up a lot of capital, et cetera. So we have more to go in optimizing RWA. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And that was a separate synthetic credit portfolio than what you moved over from CIO, or is that a part of it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, no, that one, but they had a small correlation book in the IB, this was a synthetic credit portfolio moved over to the IB, and eventually it will probably be put together. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And much smaller. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We heard recently from some people in the industry that there's the expectation of a counterparty, a major counterparty default as part of the CCAR stress test this year. Do you have any sense for whether, are you hearing that that's going to be part of it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [121]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, we've received instructions and that does feature. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's a rational idiosyncratic event that people should be prepared for. Remember, we did go through that with Lehman. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And it wouldn't be the first time we modeled such an event as part of our stress testing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. Final question. So it's always been very important to you, Jamie, that you had a record of not losing money in a quarter, through the whole credit bubble and disaster. And yet this quarter, because of the size of the litigation reserve, you did. Not a large amount of money, but you actually had a net operating loss. Do we take that as a signal of the certainty and the timing of the size of the settlement? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. I think you should take that, I mean obviously it's very painful for me personally, because I agree with you, I don't like losing money obviously for my shareholders, and we put up, and Marianne has been very clear. These are very tough numbers to estimate, it's a heightened environment, multiple agencies are involved in often the same thing. We're just trying to improve and get better and move on. Remember, these reserves relate to things that took place over multiple years, so it isn't a one year event, and we still didn't lose money during the crisis. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski ,  Autonomous Research LLP - Analyst    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [129]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marianne, you'd mentioned the CCAR resubmission. When that comes out, will that be made public, and what will we be able to get from that, and how will that impact your submission going forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I'm not expecting that the details and results will necessarily become public. Remember, it wasn't a quantitative issue per se. It was a qualitative issue, so what the regulators are looking for is our response to their recommendations and substantial progress in that. 
I do think that it obviously would be public what their response has been to that, some time in December, and we'll work out exactly when that would be. So I would expect you to understand whether our plan has been accepted or otherwise at some point in December. And we're already working on the 2014 CCAR submission. Obviously that submission in early January, which means it's will be Board approval in December and that is starting. 
All of the work, and Jamie talked about it, he talked about 500 people, thousands of people involved, models, documentation, covenants, controls, all of that work that we did for the resubmission is fully being leveraged for our ongoing CCAR processes, and we're building on it. So this for us will continue to become better over time, and 2014 will be another step in that process. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [131]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great, and as far as other changes that you're aware of, you had mentioned the counterparty failure, are there any other large items that would be a change in the way, or in addition to the way they're approaching the submissions this year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [132]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Really most significantly, the other thing that we just talked about, which is in addition to all of the other minimum levels that we've been testing against, we have new tests under Basel III, albeit a test that recognizes savings in the capital numerator, and also a slightly different denominator through time, with different minimum levels of 4% in 2014, and 4.5% in 2015. So that's the other real big framework change. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [133]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it, and related to taking the charges in this period, given what was the actual information that changed? In other words, the accounting rules tend to require a certain standard to recognize that, and if you haven't reached that agreement yet, what actually did change that required the recognition of that in Q3? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [134]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So we obviously can't comment on any sort of discussions or status of any specifics on litigation. Yes, you're right, the framework is probably an estimate. Also you should obviously assume that we didn't or couldn't estimate, all of these events were not probable at the time. But today, our reserves are appropriate for the current environment, and the information that we're allowed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Did you say at the outset that the $9 billion wasn't fully taxed because of a portion related to penalties? That would imply like roughly about a third of it, does that make sense? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're estimating some penalties, given the environment we would expect that some of the expenses would come with penalty nature, and you can obviously do the math from the front page. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [137]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [138]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But they are estimates and they include a range of matters not limited to mortgage. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [139]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks very much.

    Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [141]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you talk about the commercial loan balances? I noticed that the period-end balance had a nice increase from the third quarter, but your averages were almost flat. Is there a pick up in lending activity in the month of September? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [142]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Actually, it's a great question. There is a fronting in that number of just shy of $2 billion, $1.7 billion that will ultimately be syndicated in the short-term, so I would adjust that out when you're looking at the quarter over quarter numbers. Other than that, it's relatively flat and steady performance in core middle market and strength in real estate. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and I know the litigation questions are sensitive, so I don't know if you can answer this or not. The discussions that are going on, that we're reading about in the paper with the US government, is it more of a factor of the dollar amount that's holding it up, or is it more terms and conditions? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We can't comment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We've already said all we can say about that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [146]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that's fair. Another question is, you at your Investor Day talked about the Visa partnerships that you were just announced, could you give us some more color on how that's going, with the merchant acquiring and the payment business? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [147]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's going well but we're still, I think they are still building the systems to actually do it, and come with the products and services that we think can do a better job both for the merchants and for customers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But we're in active-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're still working on that. That's not going to happen overnight. We just think it could be a very good thing over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [150]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I assume you'll give us a good update at the Investor Day in February? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [151]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, we will try to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [152]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We will. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [153]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Coming back to the asset yields, you talked about the deposit margins improving quarter to quarter, earlier in your call. Are we at a point where the asset yields in the securities portfolio have bottomed? Are you replacing securities with equal yields or higher? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [154]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Essentially has flattened out at this point, yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [155]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And we've begun to reinvest, we're looking at the overall portfolio, we're doing some rotation, and that process has started. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [156]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Remember,  rates did go up almost 100 basis points. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [157]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. Finally, on a go forward basis once we get over all these issues that everybody is confronting today in the banking industry, with the regulatory and maybe the interest rate environment, what's going to be the capital ratio that's going to constrain your growth? Is it going to be the SLR ratio, the Tier 1 common? What's the one you think will be the real achilles heel? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So just at a macro level, talking at the firm-wide level for a second, we've said that we're looking at running the firm at a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio between 10% to 10.5%, which would imply, in any case Tier 1 capital minimums will be 11% ultimately, so we'll be at 11%-plus  from Tier 1 capital and we talked about leverage running at 5.5% over time as well. And if you think about 11%-plus Tier 1 capital, 10% to 10.5% Basel III common and a 5.5% supplementary leverage ratio given the ratio of our risk weighted assets to our balance sheet, they actually co-exist quite happily. So it is going to be a multi-variance of finding constraints, but at those levels, they exist quite nicely. 
Obviously the devil is in the detail when you push down into the businesses, client by client, product by product, and that work will go on, and as we do that work, as Jamie's talked about, we expect to be able to optimize, which will include some repricing and some restructuring of products. But at a macro level, they will co-exist relatively well. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [159]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I always add to that CCAR will be in our opinion another binding constraint over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [160]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Very good point. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [161]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Correct. Coming back to the capital, on the orderly liquidation authority, as we all know there are certain buckets of capital that have to be maintained. Do you have any clarity yet that the excess over the 9.5% under the Tier 1 common portion, will that be applicable to other buckets, so you don't have to raise as much in preferred or senior debt? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [162]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We don't know those rules yet, but presumably it's going to be equity plus preferred plus unsecured senior debt, and subordinated debt. And I think our number is at 20% of risk weighted assets there, so we're in a pretty good place but we'll see what the final rules are. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffery Harte,  Sandler O'Neill & Partners - Analyst    [165]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Most things have been covered but I'm looking at the loan loss reserve releases from the PCI portfolio, assuming credit gets better, that theory continues as well. How should we think of that going forward? Is that going to be something lumpy from time to time? Is it going to be more gradual, like it would be in a normal loan portfolio? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [166]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So with PCI-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I have to go because I have a meeting I have to go to, but appreciate the time with us, and Marianne can answer the remaining questions. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So the way to think about the PCI reserve release its the first one we've taken, and it reflects obviously improved home prices and lower severities, but it's divided by model, so if all other things from here are equal, then we are what we are. Obviously, if there are significant changes, probably primarily in home prices, but also in delinquencies, and you might see some more reserve releases. These are likely to be more periodic and lumpy, because obviously, we will be refreshing our loan loss reserves, or our life of loan forecasts over time. It's possible that you may see them in multiple quarters but that's not what we're expecting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [171]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A few questions on the investment bank, and you touched on the comp expense earlier. It's obviously very low as a percent of revenues, excluding DDA, I think it's 27% So given revenues are down, your bonus accrual must be way down. And my question becomes is that just coincidence that it happens in a quarter where you take $9 billion of regulatory litigation costs, or is there a cause and effect there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [172]

    No there's no cause and effect there, obviously.

    You say obviously, but okay.

    Well there's no cause and effect there. Full stop.

    Perfect. And then my second question, you've talked a lot during this conference call about pushing things out to clients when you have more clarity on your leverage ratio, and I guess -- the rules and what not. I guess just broader, as you think back not the leverage ratio but all the Basel III rules we've faced and all the changes in higher capital requirements and whatnot. Are you surprised at how slowly some of those price increases have been pushed down, and how slowly capacity has left the industry, or do you think it's about right, or do you think we'll see more of that going forward? Maybe you can just make broad comments there.

    Well I can certainly talk for JPMorgan, where as soon as we understand rules, we start to push them down into the organization, so that the people who are transacting at the products and the client level can make the best and most appropriate decisions to maximize returns and meet hurdles, and all of those sorts of good things. And you're right. Over the last several years, we have seen capital and liquidity increase dramatically. 
Meanwhile we are still delivering a core underlying performance in that mid-teens return on tangible common equity. So we're still competing effectively, which leads me to believe that others are doing the same thing, and that's being reflected in the competitive nature of the environment. I think it's obviously going to continue some, as we and others have set ourselves even higher targets for capital, and then obviously new rules including the SLR, but I also do think these things work through the system through time pretty quickly, given the nature of the business.

    Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.

Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [179]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One quick follow-up on your liquidity holdings here. Your excess liquidity pool looked like it increased almost $85 billion sequentially to $538 billion. Just want to know what's driving that, if there's anything you're worried about or thinking about, because I thought your LCR ratio last quarter was above 100%. And if you could just give us your updated LCR ratio, that would be great, thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [180]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So our LCR ratio last quarter was 118%. This quarter, we haven't disclosed it, but it's not far off that same level. and the increase in cash is not necessarily because we're trying to do anything from a liquidity perspective, but it also reflects inflows from clients, both operating bills, and importantly non-core non-operating deposits that we then place with the central banks.

Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [181]

    Okay, thanks.
