Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth-quarter 2012 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's, Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Mr. Dimon, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, operator. Thank you very much. Welcome, everybody, to our fourth-quarter call. I just want to start by telling you that Doug Braunstein won't be doing this call. I just want to thank him for his service to the Company. I do want to remind people, in spite of the fact that the whale happened during that time, during that time, we also had three record years of net income and something we all are very proud of this Company. And so Doug, thank you for your service if you are listening.
And we are thrilled to have Marianne here. Marianne, some of you may know, but Marianne has extensive experience in accounting, numbers. She was the Controller of the investment bank for several years, so she knows the investment banking wholesale side pretty cold. She was also the CFO of the consumer side, so uniquely she has got deep experience in both parts of the Company. And so I'm going to turn it over to Marianne. We are thrilled to have you here. She's going to take you through the numbers and then we will take any and all time you need to answer your questions as usual.
The only point before we start is I think the numbers here are really good. I mean look at the underlying detail of this Company, the third year, record income, 15% returns on tangible capital and growth in virtually every single business. And some negatives like NIM and stuff like that, which will, over time, reverse. So Marianne, let me turn it over to you and just take it through the details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. This is Marianne. I am going to take you through the presentation this morning, which is available on our website. I refer you to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements, which is at the back of the presentation.
And just before we turn to earnings, we also announced today the completion of the Board review of CIO and the management task force report. Both reports are available on our website.
So with that, we will turn to page 1. The firm generated net income of $5.7 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.39 a share, on revenue of $24.4 billion, up 10% year-on-year and down 6% quarter-on-quarter. And on the page, you see we had a few significant items for the quarter and these (technical difficulty) offset each other and we will go through them as we go through the presentation.
But what you don't see on the page is we also had a number of smaller items, many of which we will mention when we go through. For example, we made a contribution to our foundation and realized some securities gains this quarter. These smaller items also largely offset slightly to the negative.
So for the full year, we generated record net income of $21.3 billion, or $5.20 a share, on revenue of $100 billion, flat year-over-year. Return on tangible common equity was 15% for both the quarter and the year and in fact, as Jamie said, this is the third consecutive year of both record net income and 15% return on tangible common equity.
And before I turn to the businesses, I would characterize the overall performance of the quarter as strong performance across our businesses and highlight four themes. First, the positive trends in marketshare that we have been seeing continued this quarter. Year-over-year, we saw strong consumer deposit growth of 10%, mortgage origination volumes up 33% and sales volume in card up 9%. Also, the number one ranking in global IB fees, including record debt underwriting fees, record assets under custody in CIB, record revenue in Commercial Banking and record revenue in AUM in Asset Management.
Second, we continued to see positive year-over-year loan growth. On a reported basis, the total loans for the Company were up 1%, while excluding runoff portfolios, our core loan growth was 9% with record loan balances in Commercial Banking up 14%, record Business Banking loan balances up 7% and record Asset Management loan balances of $80 billion.
Third, strong credit performance continued in our wholesale portfolios, as well as in the core consumer portfolios, which have stabilized at low levels of charge-off and delinquency. The real estate portfolios continue to show improvement as the housing market continues to recover, but losses are still high.
So finally, we continue to strengthen our capital position and you can see that if you turn to page 4 and I will take you there. We ended the year with Basel I and Basel III Tier 1 common of $140 billion and $144 billion respectively, both up $5 billion this quarter. And we had strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 11% and 8.7% respectively. And to note, the estimate for Basel III of 8.7% includes the full impact of MPR as we understand it compared to 8.4% last quarter and is approximately 150 basis points over last year on a comparable basis. The return on Basel I RWA was 1.9% for the quarter ex-DBA.
And we added a few points to the bottom of the slide, which we think are important and we will spend some time at Investor Day going through our balance sheet in more detail, but just some salient points. You can see we have $450 billion of equity and long-term debt, under $100 billion of short-term debt, which is small relative to our $700 billion of cash, high-quality securities and secured financing and finally, deposits of $1.2 trillion, which fund our $700 billion of loans.
So turning onto the businesses, if you move to page 5, Consumer & Community Banking, this includes our Consumer & Business Banking, Mortgage Banking, Card and Auto businesses. There's some facts here that show the strength of our Consumer franchise. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2 billion of net income for the quarter on $12 billion of revenue. We have the number one ATM network and the number two branch network with a 150 new branches this year. We're the number two mortgage originator and number one card issuer in the US and ended the year with over 100,000 Chase Private Clients in over 1200 locations. And we have over 31 million active online and 12 million active mobile customers.
And just another thing that we are particularly proud of this year is a new accomplishment. We achieved the number one ranking in the American Customer Satisfaction Index Survey for customer satisfaction among large banks.
In the appendix, we included a page on Hurricane Sandy, which I won't take you through, but it was amazing to see how our employees rallied to support our customers and while the financial impact wasn't significant of the firm, the impact we were able to have on our customers was significant.
So onto page 6, Consumer & Business Banking. You can see net income of $756 million on revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1% year-on-year and sequentially. We continue to see pressure on deposit margins, 12 basis points in the quarter and 32 year-on-year, which negatively impacts NII, but this continues to be largely offset by deposit growth. We are growing customer deposits at more than twice the industry average, 10% year-on-year.
And also in December, we saw the lowest customer attrition rate we have seen in the last 10 years and if you take that together with the customer satisfaction results I mentioned earlier, it speaks to the great progress we are making on the customer experience. We are deepening relationships with averages balances per account up, customer satisfaction up, transaction per debit card up, active online and mobile customers up.
And just two more revenue drivers this quarter. We had record business banking loan balances of $18.9 billion with a strong pipeline and investment sales up almost 50% year-on-year with client investment assets up 15%. And almost two-thirds of these sales are managed accounts, which generate a strong recurring source of revenue for this business. Expenses were flat quarter-on-quarter and up slightly year-on-year driven by new branch builds.
Mortgage Banking on page 7, the overall net income for the mortgage bank was $418 million and there are a couple of significant items here this quarter, which I will take you through as we go through the results. Moving up to the top and production, production pretax income of $789 million on strong originations of $51 billion, up 33% year-on-year and 8% in the quarter, which reflected strong refi activity, as well as an increase in correspondence. And although margins remain elevated, as we expected, we did see compression this quarter relative to the peaks of last quarter and we do expect them to continue to normalize into 2013.
Production expense this quarter includes a litigation expense, which is a part of the significant item for mortgage-related matters that we had on page 1. Agency repurchased demand and the outstanding pipeline were both down significantly this quarter and cure rates improved driving lower losses, which resulted in a net positive $53 million for the quarter.
So on Servicing, net servicing results in the portfolio at the end of the quarter include the impact of the acquisition of $70 billion of MetLife servicing and just a reminder, it closed late in the quarter. It is high-quality agency servicing with the added benefit of additional HARP opportunity for us. Looking at Servicing expense, you can see it includes the net charge for the IFR settlement of about $700 million, which is the balance of the significant items for mortgage-related matters.
And just finally on this page, real estate portfolios, you can see pretax income of $812 million, including net charge-offs of $417 million. Charge-offs for the quarter were positively impacted by adjustments relating to Chapter 7 loans that we wrote down last quarter. And if you back those adjustments out, charge-offs would have been about $520 million this quarter versus $600 million last on an equivalent basis. And the improvement was driven by lower home-equity delinquencies.
Looking at the whole year, we saw significant improvement in charge-offs driven by a 20% to 30% decline in delinquencies and to a lesser extent improving house prices. We expect these positive trends to continue next year, but not necessarily at the same pace as this. And given these trends, we released $700 million of loan-loss reserves this quarter, which is also a significant item. And going forward, you can expect quarterly net charge-offs of $550 million plus or minus going forward.
On page 8, we will talk to you for a minute on the IFR settlement. The settlement requires us to make a cash payment of about $750 million and also provide modifications, short sales and other relief commitments of $1.2 billion.
In terms of the earnings impact, we are booking a current period charge, but we are going to see significant future run rate savings and here is how you can think about it. In 2012, our run rate expense for the IFR was between $100 million and $150 million a quarter and we expect this to continue at these levels or even higher throughout 2013. These costs will now be eliminated almost immediately and the remaining work completed by the end of the month.
If you exclude both the net settlement costs and also the IFR run rate costs, our Servicing expenses would have been around $725 million this quarter, which is obviously still very high relative to our longer-term guidance of $300 million to $350 million a quarter, but we expect that to continue to trend down and we don't expect any additional costs associated with the settlement in 2013. We already have many programs in place to help borrowers and these are fully in our reserve.
Moving on to Card, Merchant Services and Auto on page 9. Net income of $840 million, down 20% year-on-year and 12% quarter-on-quarter on revenue of $4.8 billion, flat year-on-year and up slightly quarter-on-quarter. We saw strong sales volume again in Card, up 9% year-on-year. The revenue rate you see of 12.82% reflects strong interchange revenue and merchant processing fees and low revenue reversals on strong credit performance and our merchant processing volumes were up 17% year-on-year. The net charge-off rate you see of 3.5% is down slightly quarter-on-quarter and down 79 basis points year-on-year and we believe we are at or near the bottom here. We took no reserve actions this quarter, but there may be some additional reserve releases in the first half of 2013.
On Auto, originations up 12% year-on-year, but down 13% quarter-on-quarter due to seasonality. And a final note on expenses, our fourth-quarter expenses were elevated due to the impairment of an asset related to a nonstrategic partnership.
Slide 10 and 11, and the Corporate & Investment Bank. Strong results here for a fourth quarter, net income of $2 billion on revenue of $7.6 billion for the quarter, which included DVA of $567 million, which is in the credit adjustment line item. And for clarity going forward, in addition to DVA, this line item will also include CVA and related hedges.
So if you focus on the numbers ex-DVA, $2.4 billion of net income on $8.2 billion of revenue, up 19% year-on-year and down 4% quarter-on-quarter. And just a reminder, our new reporting here reflects how we manage our clients. The traditional banking relationships are in banking and investor clients in market and investment services and we will talk more about these segments at Investor Day.
Total banking revenue of $3.2 billion is up 29% year-on-year driven by higher IB fees of $1.7 billion in the quarter, up over 50% year-on-year, making this the strongest fee quarter this year and including record debt underwriting fees. Total markets and investor services revenue of $5 billion, up 14% year-on-year, driven by markets revenue of $4.1 billion, up 19% year-on-year and down 15% quarter-on-quarter. And just to remind you, this is in line with the better end of guidance we gave you at Goldman Sachs.
It was a solid quarter for Fixed Income, up 21% year-on-year, down 15% quarter-on-quarter across products. Reminder, the impact of the remaining synthetic credit portfolio is included here in the Fixed Income result and was a modest loss again this quarter. Progress continued to be made derisking this position.
Equity markets of $895 million, up 11% year-on-year, down 14% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential change was primarily due to seasonally slower equity derivatives with CapEx [piece] holding up well.
So just moving onto drivers and at the bottom, you can see our average CIB VAR declined to $106 million this quarter, which is a significant reduction and although it is not on the page on a spot basis, VAR declined even further reflecting lower volatility in the look-back period and also the risk reduction in synthetic credit. We also had record assets under custody of $18.8 trillion, up 12% on the year and record (inaudible) revenues.
The comp to revenue ratio ex-DVA for the whole business was 27% for the quarter and 32% for the year and both for the quarter and the year, comp to revenue ratios both including and excluding DVA were basically the same for TSS, the IB and CIB. And going forward, we expect the combined business comp to revenue to be 35% plus or minus.
And just a comment on credit. Trends are stable at low levels and provisions this quarter benefited from recoveries and a reduction in the allowance related to restructured nonperforming loans.
On page 11, just before we leave CIB, there's a few metrics. Number one rank in global IB fees, number one fixed income markets revenue share through the third quarter of this year, number one ranking from institutional investor for all American fixed income and equity research and we have also made progress on our international expansion in the last couple of years. International loans and assets under custody up 50% and 33% respectively since 2010 and almost half of the revenue this year for CIB was international.
Commercial Banking on page 12. This year was the third consecutive year of record revenue and net income for this business. The quarter saw net income of $692 million, up 8% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter on record revenue on $1.7 billion and record loan balances.
(inaudible) data shows we are growing our loan balances faster than the industry average with C&I loan growth up 18% and record middle-market loan balances for the 11th consecutive quarter up 14%. We continue to see competitive pricing pressure, but spreads remained stable this quarter and lastly, we continue to see strong credit performance this quarter.
Asset management, page 13. Continued strong investment performance and long-term inflows drove the third consecutive year of record revenue. For the quarter, net income of $483 million, up 60% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter on record revenue of $2.8 billion. Total results this quarter driven by higher performance fees and improving markets and net inflows of $32 billion driving AUM growth. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows for this business.
Other positive trends included loan growth up $20 billion year-on-year driven by both mortgage and international growth and average deposits of $134 billion, up 10%. Expenses up 11% year-on-year due to higher comp expense, but the pretax margin of 29% was also up.
Moving on to page 14 and Corporate and Private Equity, overall net income of close to $500 million for the quarter included private equity net income of $50 million principally from gains on sale. Treasury and CIO had a net loss of $157 million, which included negative NII due to the low rate environment and limited reinvestment opportunities, which was partially offset by about $200 million of net securities gains and mark to market. Excluding these gains, treasury and CIO's net loss was about $300 million, in line with our guidance and we are continuing to guide to a net loss of $300 million plus or minus.
And finally, other corporate, net income here of just over $600 million includes $620 million of tax adjustments, which is our final significant item. It resulted from a reduction in tax rate for the full year and also a number of discrete items, most significantly a tax return adjustment. And although large, these items are not unusual. The tax adjustments were partially offset by $184 million of additional litigation reserves and again, if I adjust for the two items I just mentioned, other corporate net income would have been about $100 million and we continue to expect it to run at that level, $100 million plus or minus, going forward. And remember, both treasury CIO and other corporate results are likely to vary quarter-on-quarter.
Moving on to net interest margin, turn to page 15. You can see firmwide NIM declined 3 basis points and core NIM 7 basis points in the quarter. Of note, our NII held up this quarter and in fact, it grew despite this compression. There is obviously a number of items affecting NIM. First, the negative. Competitive pressure and the runoff of higher-yielding loans drove lower loan yields across the board. Lower rates in Europe drove lower investment security yields and the low rate environment continued to impact reinvestment opportunities.
And on the positive, increased hedging and a change in mix reduced the cost of our long-term debt. Hedge accounting had a neutral impact on NIM this quarter with some offsets in assets and liabilities and going forward, given the environment, we continue to expect modest pressure on NIM for the next several quarters.
So just turning on page 16, our final page, the outlook, we have covered most of these items already and we will provide more detail on our outlook at Investor Day, but we remain optimistic about 2013 and the continuation of marketshare gains, positive loan growth and improving credit trends all contributing to our results. So thank you for joining us and with that, we will open up the call to Q&A.

    (Operator Instructions). Glenn Schorr, Nomura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi there. Thanks. So over time, we have talked back and forth about housing improving and you were right and it is improving. But curious if you have any metrics for us on say what is built into the reserve models and how -- what kind of sensitivity we could have on say -- let's just say hypothetically housing improves 5% in 2013 and again in '14. Just -- I don't know if you can put metrics around it, but -- (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, we obviously have to make some assumptions going forward in house prices and they are not that different than the assumptions you would see in most other that get published by Case-Shiller, etc. Right now, they have a modest increase in home prices in 2013 and '14. I will stick with just those two years. But if it was 5% better than that, which is possible, that would run through our books in lower charge-offs and lower reserves. And just as a rule of thumb, $500 million for one year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's a very rough rule of thumb.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I appreciate that. From what I understand on CCAR this year, the Fed is going to be taking a closer look at internal stress testing and all the procedures that go around that. And I think we are going to get to see -- you are going to be disclosing some of those results. I am not front-running what we are going to see. I am just curious. In general, are we going to see that at the same time, are we going to see that on a lag basis and what you plan on disclosing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, no, we are required under Dodd-Frank to disclose our stress tests. Remember, we do -- in March. We do it almost immediately after the Fed's report. And remember, we do hundreds. The Fed is four. So we look at multiple kind of stress tests and we are going to try to give you a full view of how we look at the Company under stress. I should point out that a lot of you did it yourselves in the past. You were pretty accurate some of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Jamie, maybe the last one, on things related to part of the liquidation authority. I know we haven't seen the white paper yet, but there has been a lot of back-and-forth and I am not a believer that we are going to get the worst-case scenario that some of the people at the FDIC had thought about, but long story short is, as ironic as it is, every bank has spent the last couple of years reducing their subdebt because Basel III doesn't count it. Now, shocker, we are going to have to (inaudible) some more because the OLA is going to want it. Just curious on how much prep you can do ahead of that and what your expectations are in terms of a phase-in if that is going to be impactful in the near term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just to give you a view, we have $200 billion of equity and $250 billion of unsecured debt. That is $450 billion. That is a lot of capital before anyone else bears a loss. It is not clear to me that subordinated versus just unsecured, and it would take time to develop those markets. If a bank has 50/50 or -- obviously it changes the nature a little bit over time, so it will take time to develop. But I think we're working with the authorities to get it right, to do the analysis right, to have the right numbers. I think you have a little time before someone says it has to be this amount.
Remember, we have got Basel I, Basel II, Basel III, OLA, LCR NSF and the new one and we are going to be able to accommodate all of them. It will take a little bit of time. I do want to point out that we fully intend in 2013, late 2013, to be a 9.5% Basel III and to be fully compliant with LCR.

Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So you all are about to start buying back stock here in the first quarter and the share price is at about $45. Ironically, this is the price point historically where there has been an indication of some price sensitivity. So maybe I was hoping for an update on your thinking on that front.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we had done giving you some numbers in our annual report last year about where it is a no-brainer to buy back stock, which I said is tangible book value. Tangible book value is now $38 or $39, which has gone up, what is it, $4 this year, almost $5 this year. So we still think if you haircut earnings and buy stuck at these prices, it's probably still a good deal. We got permission to buy back $3 billion in the first quarter. Obviously, it is going to be a little price-sensitive and then CCAR will set what we can buy back for the next four quarters after that. I hope that answers your -- yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, no, I think so. So basically we can look at the tangible book value growth versus the last comments and imply from there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You can do the same numbers at today's prices. Discount, if you want to be conservative, discount earnings, buy back stock. At the end of a two or three-year period, you will apply earnings per share and higher tangible book value per share even at these prices. It seems like a pretty good deal to me. Typically, you have a good company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And you are not going to need the capital down the road. I am not talking about for one year, but down the road.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. And then the $100 million to $150 million that is coming out of your legacy costs, is that part of that $500 million per quarter that you all have highlighted in the past or is that in addition to that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Think about it as all in and we are expecting our run rate in the future to be I think $300 million to $350 million, as I said, excluding the items we talked about. Including IFR, we are at $725 million. We have got a ways to go, but it is coming down. Think about it in there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Good deal. And then the comp ratio in CIB is down this year or I should say maybe full-year 2012 about 2.5 percentage points from year prior. How should we think about the comp ratio in the IB on a going-forward basis? Have we hit a structural shift here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I think let me just put out first off that our comp ratio was 33%. If you, by the way, if you added back some of the bonuses paid in corporate that don't show up as comp in the IB, it would be like 35%. We think that the roundest number is kind of an ongoing run rate. We have formulas. We don't pay out necessarily by the formula, but we have formulas that are capital-adjusted, risk-adjusted, etc., etc. that -- that is what really guides it and it is not -- so it is really done at a much more detailed level than it will bounce around that 35%.
I should point out that again we feel good that our ROE in the investment bank was 17% this year. It was 16% or 17% last year and the year before and we are paying our people fair and well. I feel good about that. That is a good thing. That is a good business model to have something like that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure, but probably, on the whole, upward comp pressure across the street competitively is probably nowhere near as it had been. So in improvements and increased cost leverage is probably decently sustainable wouldn't you say?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I think that is probably true, but other firms have ratios of 50%, 55%. Ours is already fairly low. We want to win in the business. We are going to be competitive in compensation and obviously that will adjust over time as competition changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then last one from me, as we start to move forward towards the central clearing of swaps here late in the first quarter of '13, do you maybe have an updated view of what this transition might mean for JPMorgan's FICC business or your capital markets revenues for 2013?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At Investor Day, we will try to give you a better view of that. So there are clearly some negatives and we don't know all the rules, also some positives. So we are in a position between custody and clearing and our brokers businesses to provide some of those services for investors so they can allocate capital properly, transform the collateral and serve them better. So let the rules come out. Obviously, this is going to affect our revenues a bit, but there will be opportunities there too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [26]

    Terrific. Thanks a lot.

Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hey, good morning. A question on LCR. Jamie, you mentioned that you were going to be -- looking to be 100% compliant by the end of 2013 and I wanted to understand did the Basel release on LCR align with your sense of how it is going to shake out in the US? And I ask because the RMBS looks like it was very tightly worded, so I wonder if there is any caveats to your comment that you will hit the 100% by -- (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, here is my caveat. We are going to meet LCR this year whatever it is. It doesn't matter to us whether we like it or not. Now to answer your question, there were some changes in LCR; I think they were good, but they still capped the benefit like mortgages and we have like almost $90 billion of MBS. So government-guaranteed MBS is in what they call level 2 and therefore, you are restricted in how much [capital] liquidity.
Now personally I think that is wrong, but it is okay. We will live with it, we are moving on. I don't know why the American regulators would agree to that. Government-guaranteed MBS in a market you want where they treated liquid and remember, they already have a 15% haircut. I could argue they don't need any haircut, but look, whether changes are made or not, we are going to be compliant. It is not going to affect our earnings that much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then just separately, a small item, but on mortgages, you talked about the gain on sale that came down on the quarter and that you are looking forward to that normalizing over the course of the next year or so. Could you just give us a sense of how much we are talking about normalizing because we could go back to precrisis and it is a much bigger implication on mortgage revenues than if you are talking about just before the long end of the curve started to come down dramatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so hey, Betsy, we talked about the third quarter being -- peaking at over 200 basis points before the margins compress in some 40 or so basis points in the quarter and we do expect that to continue into 2013, not at that level. If you go back in time, you would see gain-on-sale margins more in the 65 basis points. I don't know if that is where it will end, but certainly we expect for that to be seen through 2013, but with gaining marketshare. We hope to keep our volumes up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Obviously, it will normalize over time, but it may not go that low because our expenses could also be permanently higher. To be in the business is going to cost more money and obviously that will be part of your -- what you have to earn back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. I get it. Okay, thanks.

    Ed Najarian, ISI Group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Najarian,  ISI Group - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, good morning. Jamie, a quick question. Any update with respect to how quickly you expect your Basel III risk-weighted assets to decline? We saw a little bit of a decline this quarter, expecting more decline, but is there sort of any change in the outlook for the pace of that decline or how you are thinking about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so we -- the number that Marianne showed you is the Basel III Tier 1 common 8.7. If you look at what I call for the next two years passive mitigation, that is run-off and what I call normal models, so we still have to get certain models in there and there is not arguing with anybody, it's just models that should be put in place, that would add almost 1% to Basel right off the bat. About I am going to say $100 billion of that would be models, $80 billion to $100 billion would be models. Part of that is the runoff to synthetic credit, which is obviously coming down over time.
And the other thing, which I think you're going to see, is we are pushing Basel III down, we have, but we are pushing it down at a very detailed level. I think over time you're going to see (inaudible) down capital Basel RWA even more. And there are things in Basel, which I don't know what the future portends. We have $200 billion plus of operational RWA in there now. That is driven very -- that is like $16 billion of capital. That is driven very high by obviously the mortgage litigation and stuff like that, some of which will go away. So one day, a lot -- that $200 million should come down a lot too. I just don't know the timetable for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Najarian,  ISI Group - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to that, you mentioned wanting to get to 9.5% by the end of 2013.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, I didn't mention -- we are going to get there late in 2013 whatever it takes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Najarian,  ISI Group - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Along with that, we see a number of companies sort of building a little bit, 50 basis points or something like that, of sort of a buffer on the buffer to account for AOCI fluctuation and things like that. For you guys maybe getting up to 10% or wherever the ultimate endpoint in, is that more of a '14 event or is that also something that you would like to get done this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We will answer -- to give you more feedback -- maybe we have to have a buffer. We don't know what the final rules are for capital. So you already have a conservation buffer. You go below what happens. Obviously, OCI could be a big swing. Like if you model -- I forgot -- we had modeled it. Like 300 basis points would be $20 billion after tax or something like that. But you could handle that too because it is going to come in over time and you can manage your balance sheet going forward, your stock buyback going forward. So we really need to see the future rules to make that determination. If we need a buffer, we will have a buffer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Najarian,  ISI Group - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Whatever that is, we will go there right away too, but we just don't know what it is yet. And we don't know whether CCAR is going to drive capital or the conservation buffer is going to drive capital or whatever. And we don't know how the G-SIFI exactly works, even though we know it's a 2.5%. We will probably find ways to reduce that over time. So we have plenty of capital. Right now, I am -- far more than I personally think we need, but we have plenty of capital.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Najarian,  ISI Group - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I think everyone is trying to sort of do math on how much capital you might return this year. So all of those are questions -- (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, unfortunately, that is a one-year thing, okay and I should point out that before you ask is that when we started the dividends, we said that the intent would be to increase them a little bit every year, so you should expect to see that. We are going to ask for less capital return from stock buyback than we have in the past so where I can do $3 billion in the first quarter. We are going to do less because we have determined, and this is a Board-level determination too, that we want to get to 9.5% quicker and we don't exactly know how these stress tests work. So we think under severe stress, we would have plenty of capital, but the last time the Fed's numbers were very different. We don't understand that and the way CCAR has done this year has even more volatility. Basel 2.5 is far more volatile in how you calculate RWA, OCI and all that than the old Basel I test. So we are a little cautious, which I think is what obviously the Fed expected people to do.

Erika Penala,  Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Some of the pushback that I have gotten from some investors on your strong quarter is on the provisionals overall. So I guess I want to follow on Glenn's question because clearly CIB is unsustainable from a provision basis, but it seems like there is still a lot of leverage left on the provision side from CCB. So Jamie, was your comment that if house prices were up 5% over what is in your model, the additional leverage provision is $500 million per year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, let me just separate the two. In Consumer, credit card is near the end. There could be more, but it is near the end. It's really mortgage. Mortgage reserves are going to have to come down as charge-offs come down and charge-offs are going to come down. We are not trying to manipulate our earnings or anything like that. They are going to come down. The portfolios are smaller; housing prices are going up. We just don't know exactly the pace they are going to come down, but remember they are half what they were a year and a half ago and my guess is, in a year and a half to two from now, they will be half of what they are today, which implies the reserves will come down. We have $5 billion left; that implied would be $2.5 billion. So nothing magical there. That is what is in the numbers. It is really a matter of timing, etc.
On the CIB side, it was really -- we had one or two big recoveries, so we did have, what was it, $400 million, but Marianne also pointed out there were some other negatives that got booked in CIB too. So you are right; we are not going to have much reserve takedown in CIB, but the other negatives won't be there either. So it is a little bit of a wash in CIB too from other non-reserve-related stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. And in terms of CIB activity levels, I think that the investor base did expect some strength this quarter more than seasonal. I guess could you give us a sense of whether or not the strong fourth-quarter showing is sort of a harbinger for activity levels finally picking up in 2013?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I wouldn't call it a strong fourth-quarter showing. We kind of made an assumption that the last two weeks of the year are pretty dead in terms of activity and we were a little bit wrong about that. But here is what I would say. Activity now is continuing; it is usually strong in the first part of the year. We don't know. But I personally believe that this has been, and I have been consistent about this, a cyclical, a secular change. We deal with 16,000 investors. Investable assets are going up; they are not going down. Global trade is going up; it is not going down. High net worth assets, I'm talking over 10 years and so there is a need that people have to buy and sell securities, etc. So I think the underlying trend is up and obviously spreads will compress over time. They have by the way for 20 years. That will continue.
And now we have got a bunch of model changes, not models, but like business model changes from swaps and derivatives and regulations. We will adjust all that, but there is a chance you're going to wake up one day and it will be a boomer year and no one is going to predict that either. There is a chance we happen to go into recession that it will get worse, but my attitude is I think we are very well-positioned in the business. It is very broad-based between FX rates, credits, securitized products, commodities. It is very global, emerging markets driven by research, which Marianne mentioned we are number one. So over time, it will grow. I just can't predict what it is going to do next quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And just I wanted to sneak one more in on Card. We appreciate the color on sales volume in Card and I think there is a thesis out there that if the US consumer is taking home less because taxes are higher, but the underlying economy is okay, then that could potentially translate into receivables growth finally. Is that a reasonable leap to make as we look at receivables growth for next year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Look, I think the American economy -- I've said the table is rather well set. Consumers, businesses, housing, small business they are all in pretty good shape and I think we need good policy and good fiscal policy, but yes, so we expect to see -- we have had, which I think you mentioned, we have had run-off in consumer too. Remember, in Card, from (inaudible) and some other stuff and we are running off sort of businesses and certain things we got out of, but you could start to see a little bit of growth now going forward in outstandings. Good growth in spending, a little bit of growth in outstandings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [53]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, hi. Marianne, it looks like your adjusted expenses ex-litigation IB comp came in around $49 billion or so for the year. Do you have an outlook for this number in 2013? Are you looking for some improvement in that above and beyond what you save from the foreclosure settlement?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so, hey, John, we will do that for you at our Investor Day in a lot of detail. I think the way to think about our adjusted expenses going forward, you should think about them being flat to down in terms of direction and we will go through all of that for you in February.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Is that the right number like flat to down from around that $49 billion or so level?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, around $50 billion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, okay. And then that excludes litigation. It looks like litigation for the full year came in at about $3.7 billion. That is down from $4.5 billion the year before. Do you expect that trend of declining litigation expense in '13?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One day we hope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (multiple speakers). So we don't -- yes, we won't -- we can't predict the litigation expense, I'm sorry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not clear yet. Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think the one part, which I just want to reiterate, is that obviously that one is going to be lumpy and be ongoing except the part relating to mortgages. We have done a lot of work on and we are hoping that we are properly reserved there and they are not going to see duplication of that. In the last couple of years of litigation, a lot of it related to mortgages. Not all of it, but a lot of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then on the buybacks, the first quarter is usually a big issuance quarter for you on shares, but knowing you have approval for $3 billion of gross repurchases, do you expect to have a net reduction in your share count by the end of the first quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You have got me there. I think if we buy back $3 billion and what we issue -- I think we issue --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -- amortizes in over time as we issue it --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -- so my guess is it will go down a little bit in the first quarter. When you issue restricted stock, it doesn't immediately go into fully diluted. That goes in as it amortizes. Remember this stuff amortizes over three years generally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Like for 2012, your share count didn't go down. That is because you suspended the buybacks and it didn't do enough in the first quarter to take the share count down. I assume you would like to see it decrease at some level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If we spend the whole $3 billion, my guess is it will go down, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then when you say you are going to ask for less, just to clarify, you mean you will ask for less than $3 billion per quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Last thing, on risk-weighted assets, it looks like your assets were up 2%, but Basel III RWA came down. What drove that delta? Are we starting to see the mitigation take effect?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I think, John, in part, that is it. I can get back to you with more specific details. It did come down slightly in the quarter. It does reflect the combination of our full understanding of all of the rules, plus some model changes and everything else in the quarter and BAU activity, but we can get you more detail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And one more thing. Your net interest income grew in the fourth quarter despite the NIM headwinds and the runoff. And I understand your NIM percentage outlook, but I guess what helped you grow NII dollars this quarter and do you think you can grow NII dollars in 2013?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, well, so we are continuing to grow our deposits very strongly. We are continuing to grow our loans very strongly, so core loan growth up 9%. So all in all, we are generally holding pace with NIM compression and hope to see the same next year plus or minus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford Bernstein - Analyst    [78]

    Okay, thank you.

    Mike Mayo, CLSA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Just first a factual question. How much were fourth-quarter performance fees in asset management?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It was better by over $100 million versus the fourth quarter last year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Of course, last year wasn't particularly good by the way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. My main question is does the CIO incident change how JPMorgan is run? And as you said, you have had record net income, 15% return on tangible equity. I think you said in the past -- someone at JPMorgan at least implied that the CIO incident shouldn't change things. On the other hand, you have the new cease-and-desist orders, regulatory actions by the Fed and the OCC and this change in reporting format is the most radical that has ever been put in place since, Jamie, you have been CEO and then all the changes in management. You have a new head of consumer, commercial, investment bank, international, CFO, CIO.
So on the one hand, you highlighted the record net income. I guess my question goes to sustainability of the results over the next several years given how many people have changed, the change in reporting format and the regulatory action. Maybe it is like if you are driving on the Long Island Expressway and you get a ticket for going 80 miles per hour, then you drive 50 miles an hour. Is that just completely off?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Completely off. Let me tell you where - you raised a lot of subjects; let me do them one by one. Obviously, when you have a problem like the whale, you have mistakes, which you should acknowledge and then fix. So we obviously fixed CIO totally 100%. People in it, reporting, risk, controls, committees, guidelines and we don't do synthetic credit there at all. But some of those mistakes obviously scared us and we went and checked everywhere in the Company. So we are fixing certain things across the Company. Not that they are bad, they are not disasters, but they require fixing. And so when you have an accident like that, you want to say we are going to use this to get stronger, better, smarter, tougher. And we have to and we are going to. Obviously you can't meet every demand of the regulators. So we have got real resources doing it. We have already done a lot of it. We are going to continue to do more. So yes, they were changes from the whale.
Number two, we are in business to build the business over time by serving clients. That is what we do. We do it every -- we take risk. When you take risks, you make loans; you take risks when you invest money; you take risk when you build systems and branches. But that is what we have been doing consistently and I hope you see in the underlying numbers more branches, more bankers, more custody, more trading, more products, more services, more countries, happier clients in every business. Record results in Commercial Banking, Asset Management, a lot of cross-sell in that and we are going to do a lot more to describe to you the competitive benefits that we get in this Company because the different business units work together and things like that.
So that part of the business hasn't changed. That is why we are here. Even CIO has always been doing that, investing assets conservatively because I was watching something on TV today -- you have to earn a return on your assets. The book -- you are not going to try to earn a return on your assets is ludicrous to me and to manage asset liability exposure generally conservatively. We obviously made a mistake.
And the third thing, the reorganization, that was around -- and I (inaudible) do a lot of this for you, around the client. If you said rebuild the Company from the ground up, you probably would have organized it around the clients, not necessarily by product. It is not that we were bad or banks were bad or anything like that; it is that companies acquired mortgage companies, they acquired credit card companies, they acquired retail branches. The power of that franchise is extraordinary. 40% of our retail branches own credit cards -- are credit cards today. A big chunk of our mortgage sales come out of the branches. Most of our small businesses serve out of the branches. Middle-market is served out of the branches. The branches are becoming an enormous competitive advantage for asset management. The commercial bank couldn't survive without them.
So all we did is say put together those businesses under one roof where you want to have -- you want to treat the client the way they want to be treated when they come in the front door. Same thing for CIB, the same client set in the investor side and the issuer side, the corporate side. So we go to any country. We serve the big companies, we serve the sovereign wealth funds, we serve the governments. We serve them out of TSS and we serve them out of the investment bank.
All we are doing here is better coordination, which we think will have more cross-sell and believe it or not lower expenses. Plus it will help us deal with the new regulatory environment. So both of these things are going to help us deal with the new regulatory environment to have consistent standards across all the businesses, etc. So that is why we had the reorg.
And management changes, you went through the litany of changes, but just remember Daniel Pinto has been in that business his whole life. Mike Cavanagh has been here for many years and was already running TS&S. Doug Petno has been running the Commercial Bank for several years now. Gordon Smith and Todd Maclin, we did it a little bit faster than we told people. We told people we were going to put that under one roof. Marianne Lake has been the Controller of the IB and the CFO of the consumer bank. All the people in these jobs have been here a long time and they are very good. I mean I think it is an exceptional management team.
It is too much turnover, but again the way I look at the turnover, if I have 15 people in the operating committee, you should assume that 15% to 20% every year will turn over. Some years will be zero and some years will be more. When you have reorgs and stuff like that, it is a little bit more. Hopefully, you're going to have stability. We have got a great management team. They are working a lot of different things. Most have been here a long time. And part of it, part of it relates to -- remember if you were on my Board of Directors, you would be asking me, in fact instructing me to make sure you were putting in place in big jobs the people who have to be tested to see if they can do my job. That is -- I mentioned this many years ago, that is job number one. That takes precedence over all other things. And sometimes it leads to turnover. I'm sorry.

    I guess we will hear more at Investor Day next month, but what are you watching for since there is so much rotation among top managers around the same time? What are you looking for to make -- ensure that this current team will work?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, look, you should get to know them, but you could evaluate their quality, their integrity, their brains. Mary Erdoes has been here a long time. Matt Zames, who is now Co-Chief Operating -- Frank Bisignano both been here a long time. So these are long tenured, very good, respected employees. And so I know it is going to work. Obviously, you have to make that evaluation yourself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Then last follow-up, does your positioning to ask for less than $3 billion per quarter in buybacks have anything to do with the regulatory actions that recently came about?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not really, but the CCAR does have this qualitative aspect, which I don't exactly know what that means, but not really. It really related more to the desire -- the stock price is higher and the desire to get to 9.5% quicker. Everyone's being doing it and obviously we shouldn't lag. That's all.

Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great. Jamie, I was wondering if you could kind of talk just a little bit about given the strong results that you've got and kind of the hopes of continuing to drive them, which areas you think are the best in terms of where you can see investment in either share gains or growth into 2013.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Also, Mike (inaudible) because you had me do a little work after one of your reports came out about stock price. So do this yourself. Take Bank One's stock price from the day before I got there to today, and take JPMorgan's stock price from the day we announced the deal to today, compare it to the S&P, the bank, the bank index or all other major firms and it's actually rather good. It outperformed in both cases, the bank by a long shot. In both cases, the S&P not by a long shot but by a significant margin and almost most other financial companies. So obviously something has been working a little bit here.
Opportunity, I think the opportunities are fabulous. So next year, we are going to focus a tremendous amount of regulatory requirements, these consent orders getting things done, but also just organic growth. Small business, Marianne mentioned, is up almost everywhere, partially in Florida and California where WaMu gave us the opportunity to do that. We opened our 1000th branch in California. We are still going to open net over 100 branches this year. Our credit card has been growing. The Chase Private Client, we have got 250 branches to 1200 Chase Private Client. That number is going to go up -- and I don't know if we've -- I don't know if that is public -- okay, now it's public -- to something like 2000 end of next year. It is really working. So it is growing dramatically.
Our mutual fund complex has been growing. TS&S, actually not TS&S, the Global Corporate Bank has opened multiple branches overseas. We have gone from 120 Global Corp bankers to 286 or something. It is going to be north of 300 and it is working.
If you look at Investment Banking revenues out of the commercial bank, when we first got here, I think it was like $450 million. This year, it hit almost $2 billion and we think the opportunity to continue to grow is large. So in almost every single business, we see very good opportunities to grow and obviously, we operate in a difficult world, the financial services, but in the Investment Bank, it was -- it has been -- Marianne went through the numbers, but we don't see why we can't continue to grow that around the world and serve more clients in more places like Colombia or in some of the emerging markets.
In Commercial Banking, we opened branches in non -- states we don't have branches, which have been focused on kind of larger clients and international. That is working well. International commercial bank is working well and all these numbers are in here. You guys should go through it soon. They are all pretty good and you are going to see us continue to focus on growing those businesses in a quality way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just as a separate issue, you have obviously responded to the orders from both the OCC and the Fed. Are there any kind of impacts while those are out there until they have kind of deemed them to be kind of fully dealt with and what is the timeframe for that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I think you should look at it -- we are already fully engaged in meeting all of those concents and other regulatory demands. Remember, we have changing rules and requirements. We also have a lot of items that the regulators have asked us to focus on, their consent orders. So yes, it is a tremendous amount of resource, but it is not going to change the numbers you see. It is just the people involved -- a lot of people involved in risk credit, legal compliance, audit, HR all are really involved in getting a lot of this stuff right and we have to do that. Of course and people in the business too of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. A couple questions in the mortgage banking business and as we think about the mortgage asset, I guess the first one is what is your appetite either now or as you look forward to actually portfolioing some of the mortgages you originate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so, Matt, you would have seen that we pretty much portfolio all the jumbos we originate right now. We price them to great returns and we would continue to do that. We like that asset. I think overall across the firm, we did $5 billion of jumbos this quarter and so you should expect to see that continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would just add that one of the things you learn to live with a little bit is that you could put a mortgage on your balance sheet and earn or 3.75% or 4% if it is a jumbo or something like that. It doesn't have OCI. It holds more capital, but it might be a wiser thing to do than taking the gain on sale and then buying an MBS at 2.25%. So there are all these opportunities to think through how to manage in the new world properly both for the client and for the shareholder. (multiple speakers). Go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That is really what I was getting to because I think you have one of the shorter MBS books out there. Obviously has a strong mortgage origination platform. And as we strip out kind of the legacy residential mortgages, what you are left with is not a huge number. So just trying to gauge what the appetite might be to --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It may be -- and that may change over time and get bigger. So we are doing a little bit more and right now, it is the jumbos. We have done a little bit like C pluses and stuff like that, but there may be others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then maybe somewhat related, as we think about just the underwriting standards in the mortgage business --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We would much prefer loans than securities like in commercial bank, credit card, etc. So the reason we have securities is because we can't generate that kind of loan right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As we think about underwriting standards in the mortgage business -- I mean we can see the average FICO scores that the banks do collectively that Fannie and Freddie backed still quite high. There has been some good progress with dealing with the legacy issues, not just for JPMorgan, but for the industry as a whole. Got the new guidance from the CFPB, home prices going up. What else do we need to see for banks to loosen underwriting standards of mortgage a bit?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think the QM was a really big start and kind of well thought through, but it also needs to be coordinated with Basel III, some of these NPR rules, this whole thing about OCI. So all these things are going to affect mortgage a little bit and a lot of players involved in that who have to coordinate it. But I do think over time they will open up the mortgage markets. How rep and warranty is going to be handled, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TRN, skin in the game. I think securitization will be important. So if I was the government, I would want to get QRM and securitization rules fixed as quickly as I can to allow people to start.

Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Maybe a question for Marianne. Marianne, I noticed that the global liquidity balance was up about $50 billion quarter-over-quarter to just a little bit under $500 billion. Is that in line with your guidance that you are going to meet the LCR requirements by the end of the year or is there something else going on there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would say that is probably in line with that. We have excess cash and excess capacity at central banks and that is what that reflects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    They are two different numbers, but they move in the same direction. And we will probably disclose more about that at the Investor Day too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We will.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And how much of an effect, if any, was that on the margin in the quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Probably not much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, not much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We do break it out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We disclosed it. We haven't disclosed it in the fourth quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What was it last time?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Probably like 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Interest duration. So it is probably about the same.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And I may have missed this, so I apologize if you -- (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [129]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The other thing -- right, but the important -- I think the way to look at (inaudible), we would benefit from rising rates. So I've always said that that portfolio is subordinated to the interest of the Company. It is very short. You can extend that duration or a lot more income, but then we would be hurt by rising rates and we break out the earnings and risk from rising rates -- if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points, it is about a $2 billion plus pretax. And that comes through the investment portfolio and loan repricing, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    How much would you estimate at the long end of the curve would you need to see the long end of the curve go up to mitigate the margin pressures so that you could actually see maybe margins not go down?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [131]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I can't -- offhand, it is hard for me to say that, but I think I am going to guess, but like 30 or 40 basis points. It's not a lot to neutralize it --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [132]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Correct, no, I agree.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [133]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -- to eliminate -- right, something like that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [134]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yep. The other question, and I apologize if you guys already gave this answer, but what was the gain on sale of mortgages this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The margin?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Or the dollar amount.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [137]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I think it is in the supplement. I am afraid I --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [138]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's in the production revenue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [139]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it's in production revenue, which I think was close to $800 million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [140]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And what was the spread, like 3%, the revenue spread?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [141]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Revenue was 3%, 3.5% and net was -- (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [142]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's like 3.5 times 50, actually is on closed, not --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We will do the math for you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then coming back to the return of capital, Jamie, I know this at a stock price you are not going to want to buy back your stock. I am not asking for that stock price, but let's assume for a moment bank stocks do well this year, your stock gets to that level where you are not real comfortable in buying it back. Would you guys consider, as the excess capital builds up on the balance sheet and the Fed limits your regular dividend to maybe 30% of earnings, would you consider special dividends as an avenue to give back that excess capital if you feel it is not -- you are not comfortable buying back the stock at the price at some future level?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First of all, it is a Board-level decision and in some ways, it is a nice problem to have, but the way you set the question up you almost have no option. You can't buy back stock and you can't raise your dividend. All you have left is something like that. So we will get there when we get there. Again, we need to see all the new rules and how they are going to apply like this conservation buffer and we may know more by Investor Day, but when we know more, we will let you know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Wheeler,  Mediobanca - Analyst    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, good morning. A couple of questions. The first one, on the latest reorganization, I guess that comes with you in the light of having completed the integration of both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. It makes complete sense, but have you actually set any targets in terms of both the revenue and cost synergies you think you might achieve in the medium term? That is the first question.
And the second one was on the $80 billion to $100 billion of RWA you think you could shed by reworking your models. Something ironically you have been pretty critical about in the past in terms of the Europeans' view on that. But can you just tell me is it getting more difficult to do that in the market (inaudible) at the moment? We are getting some pushback from (inaudible) on some of the risk-weighted asset calculations or are you finding it pretty straightforward to actually negotiate that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So the first one is obviously we do budgets and stuff. We put targets in place, things we would like to accomplish. So that is in how we look at -- we are not going to disclose it to you. But I did say that we do think it is going to enhance revenues and reduce expenses a little bit. So a little bit is in there for the CIB and a little bit in there for consumer. And we are going to disclose more at Investor Day about kind of cross-sell and how we look at it and where we think we can benefit, etc.
And if you look at risk-weighted assets, we are up to -- our balance sheet is $2.4 trillion. We have got $200 billion of money deposited in central banks around the world or in repo, very short-term investments, $350 billion in AA securities and $400 billion in securities borrowed or resales. We have a really, really liquid balance sheet. I just mentioned $750 billion, almost $1 trillion of very short-term stuff that is sitting there on our balance sheet in the asset side and our risk-weighted assets are now $1.65 trillion. They have gone up dramatically because of Basel 2.5, the fact that we don't have certain models in place that will be accepted.
So some of the benefit arguably is going to be just -- I am going to call it run-off. Some is from models that regulators expect people to design and put in place that we don't have yet. We just don't have the history or we haven't done the modeling and that is -- a lot of it is around credit-related, synthetic credit type stuff, securitizations and things like that. So we are going to put those in place. And that is not arguing with regulators; they would expect us to do that over time. Obviously, regulators -- I know they are going to look at how people do models around the world and they want this done fairly, etc.

    Marty Mosby, Guggenheim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marty Mosby,  Guggenheim Partners - Analyst    [152]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I wanted to ask a detailed question about the mortgage rate purchase expense. You were able to show this quarter that you had a reduction in the reserve of $249 million and only experienced $196 million of losses. So you actually net brought down the impact there. And in your outlook, you talked about being able to offset future losses with release of reserves. So I wanted to ask that question first and then I had one more follow-up after that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [153]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure. So think about repurchase. So both sides of that we do them separately. So repurchase losses, I told you you will see demand down significantly, you will see the outstanding pipeline down significantly. We have seen cure rates improve and so our realized losses were sub $200 million and it is what it is and it is a factor, a feature of activity obviously and it can vary a little.
On the repurchase reserve side, it is obviously model-driven and we use inputs, including things like cure rates. So it is not going to be a perfect offset in this quarter. It happened to be slightly more and over time, over the next few quarters, we think they could largely offset that you might see some small pluses and minuses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marty Mosby,  Guggenheim Partners - Analyst    [154]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So we should see a -- we have gone through an inflection point here where you think the demands are coming down and improvement of what you are seeing overall but that drain should be somewhat mitigating going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [155]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, and I would say we are in constant dialogue with the agencies and obviously people ask about behavior and we are in constant dialogue, we think we understand the direction it is going and we feel good about where we are right now and we will continue to monitor that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marty Mosby,  Guggenheim Partners - Analyst    [156]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then as we look into 2013, I was trying to take a little bit of your outlook and just kind of create a net progression. If you look at the $1 million that you basically highlighted in margin compression, you have a natural offset that you have explained in the servicing expenses for about $400 million. So if you take your current run rate of operating of $1.35, annualize that to $5.40, you have probably got somewhere between $0.07 and $0.10 worth of negative that comes out of that from netting out the positive that you have in the servicing expenses from margin compression.
If you then move incrementally for growth, if you offset a lot of the margin compression with loan and deposit growth, then you are being able to generate about $1 billion of incremental by just growth and overall balance sheet. If you look at expense savings and then some reduction in shares, you can kind of look at how you would layer in towards something like 10% kind of growth next year as you kind of mirror those kind of big moving pieces. So I just want to make sure we were tracking those and if you had any other thoughts about incremental opportunities to create EPS next year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [157]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I don't know how to respond to that. I think -- maybe you can call later and get some more feedback on some of the stuff you said. You can call Sarah Youngwood at investor relations. But you went through a lot of the stuff that is accurate. Obviously we are in an environment -- the environment changes all the time, but we have growth plans everywhere. So it isn't like we are sitting on our laurels and just looking at what is going to -- NIM compression, stuff like that. So we expect to grow earnings next year. I may be wrong, but that is what we expect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marty Mosby,  Guggenheim Partners - Analyst    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And I guess, Jamie, the bottom line is that you have product growth to offset margin compression, but then you have got share repurchase and some efficiencies that create incremental growth. I guess that is the bottom line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [159]

    Good morning. Can you just give us an update on where you are on the synthetic portfolio? I know you probably don't want to give a dollar amount, but is it mostly gone and what the timeframe is of that -- even if it is a modest drag, just having that off the books completely?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [164]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think we had said earlier, on July 13, we hope it is almost a nonissue by the end of the year. I think we are getting there. I think from the day that -- and we are not going to give you more detail than what I am about to tell you so don't ask. We had modest losses in the fourth quarter. There is no reason to have any losses going forward. The risk from the date of the investment bank got and they have done a good job continuing to derisk it are down, I am going to say, another 50%.
So obviously, there is still risk. It is still a portfolio which has got -- the average duration I am going to say is 2, 2.5 years left. So if you did nothing, it is going to diminish dramatically over time, but I think we have got it well-controlled at this point. There could be some volatility because of the nature of it. It has got some idiosyncratic exposures in there, but we think we are fine. We don't think there's anything that anyone needs to worry about anymore.

    Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on the deposit growth, I think you were up on a period-end basis $54 billion. Is there any way to kind of get a sense of how much of that is stickier? Was that just sort of fiscal cliff concerns or was it the TAG-related deposits? Do you have any sense on what was driving that and if it is just more sustainable organic growth that would be helpful?

Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [166]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You have got to do it a little bit by business because I think in consumer mostly sticky, but it is probably a little bit of TAG -- like you guys had an estimate for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, like (inaudible) plus or minus. Mostly those deposits we would consider core and sticky.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. And then TS&S is a lot of seasonal year-end deposits, so it bounces all over the place. Asset management I put in the sticky category. Commercial Bank has been kind of flat, but it is sticky.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [169]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that's helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [170]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is flat because the loans are starting to grow and it is huge. Commercial has $190 billion of deposits. I think that number was $100 billion 3.5 years ago. So they have a lot of money there. We actually expect that might have come down one day as companies start to grow and expand more aggressively, which would be a good thing.

Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [173]

    Yes, good morning. This first question is a little bit short term, so forgive me, but the CFTC, as somebody mentioned earlier, did push back the timing of some of the OTC reforms with respect to central clearing. And I guess my question is, from your point of view, all other things being equal, should we expect stronger fixed income revenues as a result of that in the first half than we otherwise might have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [174]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's a woulda', shoulda', coulda'. I don't know, Guy, the answer to that question. I think if they had been put in place -- it depends how they would have ultimately been put in place. So they were delayed to get more work and how it gets done. I think if they had been put in place for JPMorgan where the rules constrained us overseas, but didn't constrain other companies overseas, we would be down from what we might now have. If the rules were put in place as we can compete freely in Frankfurt, London, Singapore and Shanghai, my guess is our US revenues would have been down a little bit, our international revenues would have been up a little bit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [175]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that is actually real helpful. Thanks. My other couple of questions have to do with your outlook slide. First of all, on corporate private equity, I just want to make sure that there is no distinction that I should read. When you talk about treasury and CIO, you talk about the net loss of $300 million plus or minus specifically in the first quarter. When you talk about the other corporate $100 million, you don't mention a timeframe. So does that mean that you expect more potential variability over say the course of this year in the treasury and CIO number than the other number, which is more of a run rate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [176]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, so private equity is $8 billion invested. We expect to earn a return on that. We are obviously getting a great return on it, so that is lumpy, but it should be more than $50 million on average. Treasury -- think of treasury as NII. It is very predictable. The NII (inaudible) by quarter. That number will go down a little bit. That is just how we allocate capital and funds between all the business units. And then how we invest the assets.
So we can change that tomorrow by having longer duration in our investment portfolio. The lumpier part of treasury and CIO is when we have mark-to-market gains and securities gains. That bounces around a little bit and again some of that is discretionary. So we don't look at that -- we should almost call it a net loss, and that number -- I think the $300 million will come down over time, not go up for a whole bunch of different reasons, which I won't go through right now.
And then the other corporate -- that has net allocations, BOLI, COLI, taxes, all these lumpy items and we will just try to tell you it should be plus 100 -- it could be on average 100, plus or minus a couple hundred because of lumpiness of those items. Like corporate taxes are lumpy for a whole bunch of different reasons and so our numbers would be 100 on average. And we always explain the difference if there is ever a big difference there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [177]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So if I add the two together, and obviously we know there is lumpiness, but just adding those two numbers together at face value, we are talking about a quarterly loss of a couple hundred million. You used to guide to quarterly earnings of I think it was $100 million to $200 million on that kind of combined line. So if I was trying to assess what the swing had been relative to a few years ago, how much of it would you say is just the compression of net interest margins and how much of it is moving away from some of the, pardon the word, but exotic investment strategies that CIO used to --?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [178]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It has got not a damned thing to do with exotic investment strategies, zero, nada, nothing, okay? The bulk of those assets are always invested conservatively, AA plus. We had to do it around the world, so deposits around the world, etc., nothing to do with that. It has all got to do with some of the NIM compression that shows up there because obviously investment portfolio yield has gone down a little over 2%. It was 4% three years ago and how we allocate capital and things like that.
The changes you have seen. Some of them are the differences due to the regulatory changes of B3, RWA and stuff like that. So we will try to make this a little bit clearer going forward. But on average, that number will come down, not go up over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [179]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that's fair. And then the final question I have is just on the [firmwide] right below that. You talked about capital allocations a moment ago. It sounds like your LOB return on equity targets are, like you say here, are going to come down for some units and therefore overall but the corporate guidance is the same. So does that mean that basically all this change just is because you're allocating more capital out to the business units and you will have less at the corporate parent? That is the only real change?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [180]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, when we allocate the new Basel III operational capital debt, the capital allocations will go up mostly to the CIB by I am going to say 20% or so and to the commercial bank by 20% or so or maybe a little bit more than that. And that will obviously change the return targets for those units. It will also be very healthy, so it will just come down. The Company will be exactly the same.
I mean so we just have -- I think when we allocate all this stuff intelligently, it will actually probably end up driving better returns over time as people learn how to manage it a little bit differently. So we will be allocating -- again, it eventually will show more. We will be allocating out -- think of it as everything at one point, LCR, G-SIFI, Basel III, Basel II, whatever comes down the pike will be allocated out so our managers can manage through it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [181]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. That's great. Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [182]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the other thing we haven't decided permanently is how you look at each business because my feeling has been, this is open for debate, is that the business should be capitalized the way its competitors are going to be capitalized so they would feel free -- they are free to compete in that category. I think the people lump their capital ratios around their competitors. That could be very hard for someone for example to be -- run with 7.5% capital and all their competitors are at 10% or vice versa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [183]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So you are going to try to move both capital and cost allocations more to each unit being on a stand-alone basis, is that right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [184]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, cost is cost. It has nothing to do with that. I am talking about capital -- saying we may capitalize the commercial bank at 8.5% and the investment bank at 10%. It may not be 9.5% for everybody because they have to operate, they have to compete in different environments. So that is where you just -- we just haven't figured out exactly how to do that yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [185]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. Thanks.
