Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the JPMorgan Chase third-quarter 2014 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, operator, good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on page 1, the Firm delivered strong underlying performance this quarter with net income of $5.6 billion on strong revenue of over $25 billion, up 5% year on year, reflecting growth across most of our businesses; and EPS of $1.36 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% for the quarter.
Included in our results is Firm wide legal expense of approximately $1 billion after-tax, which relates to a number of matters, in large part an estimated amount for FX, which was treated as non-deductible tax purposes.
There were also a number of smaller items, most notably a benefit of approximately $400 million of tax discrete items in corporate, as well as consumer reserve releases of $200 million pretax. Excluding these and other non-core items net income was approximately $5.8 billion reflecting strong core performance.
The quarter was characterized by continued strength in our leadership positions as well as market share gains across the consumer businesses, higher levels of market volatility and client volumes than anticipated in CIB and record performance and asset management.
Core loan growth for the quarter was strong, up 7% year on year, while maintaining strong discipline across the board and with encouraging trends in consumer. We've also continued to make progress against our capital targets with a CET1 ratio of 10.1% and firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.5%, all while returning approximately $3 billion of capital to shareholders the quarter, with gross share repurchases of $1.5 billion.
Turning to page 2 -- adjusted expense that -- excluding legal, was $14.7 billion in the third quarter, down approximately $30 million quarter on quarter with an adjusted overhead ratio of 59%. We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses.
Although our third-quarter adjusted expense may appear elevated in comparison to our full-year target of $58 billion, it was substantially driven by higher market performance versus our earlier expectations. If the positive momentum continues in the fourth quarter it is likely that our total adjusted expense will be above $58 billion, but obviously on higher revenues.
On credit, despite lower reserve releases, Firm wide credit costs remain very low, driven by reduced net charge-offs. We expect total net charge-offs for 2014 to be less than $5 billion, which is below our previous guidance.
Also included on this page are the returns generated by each of our businesses this quarter. Of note the commercial bank and asset management achieved 18% and 25% ROEs respectively, in-line with their through the cycle targets. CCB was at 19% and, if you back out the impact of legal expense in CIB, its ROE would've been around 14%.
Moving on to capital on page 3 -- the Firm reported a fully phased in advanced CET1 ratio of 10.1%, up from 9.8% last quarter, reaching our year-end target of 10% plus. Not on the page but for your information the fully phased in standardized ratio was 10.5%.
As you know, the final US rules on SLR and LCR were published in September. On SLR there were no notable changes and, as I just mentioned, the Firm's SLR was 5.5%, reaching our target level and we were at 5.7% for the bank this quarter.
The LCR final US rule had some changes versus the NPR. Remember, we have been disclosing our LCR compliance relative to the Basel rules. The US final rule is in some ways more punitive, but we remain compliant with a more modest buffer.
Moving on to business performance starting with CCB on page 4 -- the combined consumer businesses generated $2.5 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%.
I'd like to draw your attention to the right-hand side of the page; it shows that the long-term investments we've been making in the business are paying off, illustrated by the many leadership positions we hold. We are particularly proud of our customer satisfaction rankings.
We're seeing continued strong growth in the underlying business drivers. Average deposits were up $35 billion year on year, an increase of 8%. Our active mobile customer base is up 22% and credit card sales volume of $120 billion was up 12% on strong new account originations.
Across CCB we reduced headcount by over 10,000 this year against our year-end target of 8,000 outlined at Investor Day. And we expect a total reduction of 11,000 or so by year end.
Finally, before I move on, as you are aware, JPMorgan and certain others in the financial services industry experienced cyber attacks this quarter. We are taking every step to protect our customers and our Firm, but these attacks highlight the need for continued and increased cooperation among businesses and the government to systemically reduce and resolve cyber threats. We are committed to doing our part. To date we have not observed elevated levels of fraud related to this matter.
Turning to page 5, Consumer & Business Banking -- CBB generated net income of $914 million, up 20% year on year. The business continues to improve its operating leverage with an ROE of 33%, up 6 percentage points versus a year ago, with revenue up 5% and expense relatively flat.
Underlying business drivers remain strong. Average deposits of $476 billion were up 9% year on year and client investment assets were up 16% to a record $208 billion.
We continue to see strong deposit growth across regions and markets. In fact, for the third consecutive year we led the FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth among the largest 50 US Banks. Overall we grow our deposit share in 46 of our 50 largest markets nationwide and we remain number one in three of the largest deposit markets.
Moving on to revenue, net interest income was up 4% year on year driven by strong deposit growth offset by continued pressure on margins. And noninterest revenue was up 6% with investment revenue growth driven by Chase Private Client and with the addition of over 700,000 households driving stronger fee income. Expense is relatively flat with efficiency improvement in the business being offset by increased cost of control.
Finally, on business banking originations, the momentum that we've seen in recent quarters continues and we believe we have outperformed the industry with loan originations for the quarter of $1.6 billion, up 27% year on year, down quarter on quarter seasonally.
This reflects a combination of industry trends improving driven by business optimism generally continuing to remain strong and improving banking performance, especially in the expansion market as our targeted strategies mature. We do expect the strong growth to continue through the remainder of the year.
Mortgage Banking on page 6. Overall mortgage banking net income was $439 million for the quarter with an ROE of 10%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging, mortgage production pretax income, ex-repurchase, was slightly positive for the quarter, a little better than guidance on better-than-expected expense performance.
Originations are approximately $21 billion or up 26% quarter on quarter against a market that we estimate to be up approximately 10%. Therefore we believe we've gained share and that share gain has been in high-quality jumbo and conventional eligible bonds which, as you know, are the segments we are focusing on.
As a reminder, with purchase mix up the business has become much more seasonal with volume and profitability peaks in the second and third quarters and lows in the first and fourth. Given this we still expect the fourth-quarter results to be a small negative as previously guided.
Finally, on production we had a $62 million benefit in the quarter driven by refinements to our repurchase reserve.
On to servicing, net servicing-related revenue of $639 million was down $54 million quarter on quarter, again on the better side of our guidance due to gains on the sale of Ginnie Mae loans.
Looking forward into the fourth quarter, core servicing revenue will continue to decline and we expect less benefits from other revenue sources, such as those from Ginnie Mae sales, given lower delinquencies and lower loan modification volume. As a result we do expect fourth-quarter servicing revenues to be $600 million or slightly lower.
Servicing expense increased approximately $25 million quarter on quarter due to investments in control and operational improvements. You will note that this represents a delay in achieving our target of $500 million for the fourth quarter. However, we are doing what is necessary to improve our controls and operational processes and we expect servicing expense to continue to decline through 2015 at a slower pace.
MSR risk management was a modest gain of $76 million reflecting regular model updates. On real estate portfolios we added approximately $6.8 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, up from $5 billion in the second quarter.
Loan quality remains very strong, we recorded net charge-offs of $81 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the noncredit impaired portfolio, reflecting improvements in home prices as well as delinquencies.
Lastly on mortgage, headcount was down approximately 6,000 year to date, meeting our target for the year outlined at Investor Day. And we are on track to reduce it by an incremental 1,000 or so by year end.
Turning to page 7, Card, Merchant Services & Auto -- net income of $1.1 billion, down 10% year on year, but up 4% excluding reserve releases with an ROE of 23%, reflecting very strong spend as well as balanced growth of $3 billion year over year. Continuing momentum we saw last quarter as growth and our core business is now outpacing the runoff portfolio.
Overall we saw strong and stable revenue of $4.6 billion, flat year on year. Loan growth as well as strong sales volume was offset by spread compression and higher amortization of customer acquisition costs. Expense is up 4% year on year predominately driven by higher [forward] expense related to Home Depot and higher auto lease depreciation.
In Card sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 26th consecutive quarter. This industry outperformance is being driven by the value proposition of our core Chase branded and partner products and the investments we are making in customer acquisition, ultimate rewards, marketing and customer service. These investments are driving strong new account originations, up 29%. And the performance of these new accounts, 2013 and 2014 vintages, is exceeding our expectation.
In merchant services volume was up 15% year on year driven by continued strong sales performance. But transaction growth was up 6% year on year lagging sales growth, driven by merchant mix and aggregation trends.
In auto new vehicle sales continue to grow year over year with the third quarter up 8%. We've seen the 12th consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth despite a very competitive market and credit losses continue to be stable and low with the auto pipeline remaining healthy, consistent with a recovery in the auto market.
Moving on to credit, the environment remains benign. We continue to see improvements in card early delinquencies and the card net charge-off rate was 252 basis points, an all-time low. This quarter we released $100 million of auto and student lending reserve with no releases in card.
During September a new step forward in the evolution of payments was announced, Apple Pay. We are excited to be a key player in a solution that offers improved security and a streamlined customer experience. At the same time we are continuing to develop other innovative payment solutions.
Moving on to page 8 and the Corporate & Investment Bank -- CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of $8.8 billion and an ROE of 10% or 14% if you adjust for legal expense. In banking total revenue was $2.7 billion, down 6% year over year. IDCs were $1.5 billion, up 2%, with revenue growth in advisory and equity underwriting fees on strong market activity being offset by lower debt underwriting fees.
We maintained our number one ranking in global IDCs per Dealogic with particular strength in ECM in Europe and IPOs globally and we remain a go to bank for large deals and related financing. The ID pipeline is strong with an environment supported of M&A and a strong equity underwriting market.
Treasury Services revenue was $1 billion, in line with our guidance, and Lending revenue was down approximately $200 million year on year, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses of over $100 million in this quarter versus modest gains in the prior year on securities received from restructuring.
So let's spend a moment on market revenues. The green shoot and the potential upside to our performance that we've been seeing in early September did in fact materialize and our reported markets revenues were up 1% year on year, despite a strong third quarter last year, a quarter in which we significantly outperformed.
In fixed income in currencies and emerging markets a strong quarter and a particularly strong September with pickup in both volumes and volatility as currency markets benefited from divergence across global monetary policies, an average quarter for commodities and credit and an improving quarter for rates.
In equities we saw quite strong performance for a third quarter in line with last year. Cash was very strong in EMEA on the back of a strong primary market and equity derivatives results were lower versus a record last year, offset by an uptick in prime services revenue on higher balances and continued growth.
Of note, customers are taking notice of the progress we've been making in building out our electronic trading platform. And we are seeing strong growth in electronic trading volumes, up 50% in year on year in Europe and nearly 20% in the US.
Moving on to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to have completed the sales of our physical commodities business and detailed portfolios, which were major parts of our business simplification agenda and with limited impact on ROE over time.
However, these sales will present revenue headwinds in the fourth quarter. And based upon their contributions to last year's results, these will drive an approximately 8% revenue decline year-over-year or approximately $300 million.
So outside of the year-over-year decline driven by business exit, we are cautiously optimistic that momentum may carry over. However, October so far has been mixed, likely on the back of a changing market sentiment around the prospect for global growth and inflation.
Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 8% year on year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits, down quarter on quarter 5% on seasonality. Assets under custody were $21.2 trillion, up 8% year on year. Credit adjustments and other, a positive $240 million, is driven primarily by DVA and FVA as a result of credit spread widening and refinements to certain assumptions.
Moving on to expense, total expense was up 21% year on year with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter and year to date. Non-comp expense was up 21% year on year primarily driven by legal expense, but down 2% quarter on quarter as increased legal expenses were more than offset by lower cost of business simplification and other expenses.
Just quickly on CIB loans, the headline 5% decline for loans is driven by lower client overdraft and trade. Underlying that, traditional credit portfolio and other HFI loans were up by over 10%.
Moving on to page 9 and Commercial Banking -- the quarter saw net income of $649 million on revenue of $1.7 billion with a strong ROE of 18%. Revenue was down 3% from the prior year and 2% sequentially, reflecting yield compression in our lending book as well as business simplification, partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances.
Expense of $668 million was in line with guidance and relatively flat year on year and quarter on quarter, despite ongoing investments in controls. Loan balances increased $1.6 billion in the quarter driven by continued strong performance in our commercial real estate businesses.
CRE loans increased 13% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter, both in excess of the industry, and our CRE book has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters. C&I loans were relatively flat from the prior quarter, broadly in line with industry trends.
Of note, deposits increased $5 billion in the quarter, mostly in Middle Market and corporate client banking. This is reflective of our clients still managing with very high levels of liquidity. Having said that, utilization rates were up slightly for the quarter and pipelines continue to move incrementally higher across the board.
Outside of lending we continue to make good progress in building our core franchise. This quarter growth investment banking revenue was approximately $500 million, up 12% from last year, and on a year-to-date basis the commercial bank has generated $1.4 billion of investment banking revenues for the Firm up 22%.
Card and merchant services revenue increased 7% from the prior year. And finally, since this time last year we've added approximately 500 new clients in targeted industries.
Overall credit performance remains strong with net charge-offs of only 1 basis point, marking the seventh consecutive quarter with net charge-offs in the single-digit or very low or recoveries.
As you think about the coming quarter, we do expect returns to continue. We would like to remind you of the one-time proceeds of approximately $100 million that we received in the fourth quarter of last year from a lending-related workout.
Moving on to page 10, Asset Management -- an excellent quarter in asset management with record net income of $572 million, up 20% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter with a 25% ROE and a 31% pretax margin, in line with our through the cycle target. For the full year we expect these ratios to below our through the cycle target.
You will see that we changed from reporting our revenue by client segment to reporting revenue by line of business to be consistent with how we manage the business. So we are introducing sub line of business results for revenues in global investment management and global wealth management.
Overall revenue of $3 billion was up 9% year on year, reflecting an increase in management fees driven by long-term net inflows, including $16 billion this quarter. This marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion up 11% year on year.
While we continue to see strength in our multi-asset and fixed income flows equity flows were flat this quarter. Asset Management expense of $2.1 billion was up 4% from a year ago and up modestly 1% versus last quarter.
In banking we reported strong performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances up 16% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter with growth coming from both our US and our international markets and a solid pipeline for demands for the remainder of the year. Deposits were also a record, up 9% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter.
Lastly as reported, client assets of $2.3 trillion were up 4% year on year and down 5% quarter on quarter. However as part of business simplification we closed the sale of the RPS business during this quarter, recognizing a small gain reflected in [GIM]. Excluding the impact of the RPS sale client assets would have been up 10% year on year and flat quarter on quarter.
Moving on to page 11 and Corporate and Private Equity -- Private Equity reported $71 million of net income driven by net violation gains including a small net gain related to the portfolio sale in OEP which we announced in the quarter, predominantly offset by related expenses. Year to date the portfolio balance is down by approximately $2.5 billion and with the sale we expect it to be down by about $4 billion by year end.
Treasury and CIO reported a small net loss of $30 million with NII slightly positive in the quarter, and other corporate net income at $357 million; included in this result were a tax-related benefit of approximately $400 million, as I previously mentioned, as well as approximately $500 million pretax of legal expense with the remainder of the Firm wide legal expense principally in the IB.
At the Firm level our tax rate for the quarter was 28%, broadly in line with a normalized tax rate of 30% plus or minus. Nondeductible legal expenses in CIB were offset by tax benefits here and other corporate.
Before moving on to our outlook page, Firm NII was up approximately $320 million quarter on quarter driven by lower interest expense in CIB and core NII was up approximately $110 million.
Moving on to page 12 -- you can see on the page our current outlook which I've already addressed throughout the presentation. Wrapping up, a strong result for a third quarter despite legal expense of $1 billion after-tax. This reflects the strength of each of our franchises and the benefit of the diversified business model.
We have made substantial progress against our control and regulatory agenda as well as business simplification, albeit with more work to do. And we have successfully executed against our 2014 target of capital leverage and liquidity.
As I have shown you today, the investments we are making in our businesses are fueling growth and underpinning strong earnings now and in the future and we remain focused on serving our customers and safeguarding their assets and our Company. With that, operator, please open up the lines for Q&A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions). Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you just give us a sense of what is left in terms of simplifying the model? Maybe split it between the CIB and consumer if that is a good way of approaching it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I mean, so, Matt, I would say we I think -- and I can't remember which quarter it was, but several quarters ago we put a slide out in the presentation that showed what -- it was last year -- showed what the business simplification agenda looked like.
I think if you go back and now look at what we have done, including what we were able to either complete or sign this quarter, OEP, the RPS business, GSOG, Commodities, we've certainly broken the back of most of the business simplification agenda. Having said that, it is an ongoing process and we continue to de-risk clients and industries and continue to simplify our products in mortgage and the like.
So I would characterize that the actions that we have taken by the end of this year are substantially all of them. But at the margin we continue to look at client by client product by product to simplify things.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, and as a follow-up, somewhat related, but as we think about having more clarity on the capital rules and specifically the supplemental leverage ratio as well as the LCR, is there some opportunity for optimization of the balance sheet now that you have more clarity on those rules?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, we have talked before about the fact that when you take into consideration a combination of the leverage and liquidity rules together with our own point of view on positioning the Company for rising rates. So therefore our own point of view as being under invested in the duration perspective, that we have, we believe, a relatively optimized balance sheet.
Although it likes like we have a significant amount of cash, that is in part non-operating deposits that at some point will either flow out or be adequately paid for by the client return and in other parts is part of our overall liquidity.
I mentioned that subsequent to the US LCR rules being made final that although we had been reporting previously against Basel compliance in the 20%-plus range, so a buffer of 20%-plus. The US rules are more punitive in a number of ways, most notably that they look at peak outflows in 30 days relevant cumulative and also on higher outflow assumptions across the categories. Given that we are not compliant with a more modest buffer. So we would say that we are largely optimized.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then just lastly, the $300 million of revenue going away in the fourth quarter, what would be the expenses and capital against that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, the capital is relatively minimal in comparison to the overall Firm. So while it obviously is positive for us, it is not a noteworthy number. And the expenses, just to note that I said the ROE is limited over time; this is a business that was still being built and therefore hadn't yet reached a maturity stage or a stage where it was returning its hurdle.
It will take a little bit more time to take the expenses out so there will be a slight lag in removing expenses. So in the fourth quarter it will be more modest, but over time it would be a large chunk of that $300 million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks for taking my questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald, Sanford Bernstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne, I was wondering if you could give us some broader context on the core expenses. Is a principal driver of the updated outlook around the $58 billion -- is that just comp? And can you remind us where you are on the compliance control expenses in terms of leveling off there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So we had a better third quarter than we had been expecting earlier in the quarter. We will see how the fourth quarter pans out. So, yes, it is the case that if we have a better fourth quarter and therefore a stronger second half of the year that our expectations for comp will be higher.
They'll still be well within our comp to revenue ratio range of 30% to 35%, I mean you saw for the quarter 32% year to date the same. So in large part it is going to be based on higher revenues in market. This quarter we also had higher revenues in mortgage and also in corporate. So that is the principal driver.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And as we look out to 2015 (multiple speakers)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sorry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we look out further to 2015 and 2016 can you give us a reminder of where you are looking to reduce the core expense base and get some savings on a one- to two-year basis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Before I do that, you had a second part to your question on the cost of controls. Let me just deal with that very quickly.
We talked about the fact that we expect our control cost to reach a peak this year, that is still the case. So I would say that they are substantially in our run rate by the end of the year.
They will over time be able to come down; they will still remain elevated relative to historical because that is the new business world we are in. But we are going to be able to become more efficient, automate things, finish remediations, look backs. So over time that will provide leverage.
In terms of looking out to 2015 and 2016, while we haven't given specific guidance I will just point you to a few things. The first is we do expect to continue to see mortgage servicing expense decline on the back of delinquency and credit trends.
We would also expect to see improvements in the production space albeit we are -- there is a reasonable fixed cost base. But nevertheless, as you saw this quarter, we continue to make great progress in resizing that expense base.
In the nonmortgage space in the consumer bank, Gordon has committed to $1 billion in 2016 over 2014 principally but not exclusively driven by automation and efficiencies in branch staffing leverage and also the branch footprint optimization.
And then while we didn't quantify it, Daniel is very much looking at the expense equation for positive leverage that is reasonably significant over the next two years in the CIB. So I would say across the board obviously we are growing in asset management, we are investing in our businesses notwithstanding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that is helpful. And then on the legal expense, did you give any color in the beginning on what was that for this quarter? And in terms of the FX and LIBOR investigations, are those at the stage yet where reserves can be built or can you offer anything on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So at the beginning what I did say is that there are a number of masses in our legal expenses for the quarter, but in large part it does relate to FX. And consequently you can read into that that things are further progressed this quarter than last, but obviously we can't comment any further.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then just in terms of share buybacks and capital levels, was wondering about your thoughts on the prospects for higher G-SIB buffers in the US. And how are you going to balance in the near term kind of your -- growing your space capital against executing the remaining buyback authorization that you have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So just to talk about it, so we did $1.5 billion of buybacks this quarter, same last quarter. Obviously we have another $2 billion to go in terms of our approval. We don't know what the rule is going to be, it will come out before the end of the year, we will have to see what that says.
There will be a transition timeline, it will transition on the same timeline phase and timeline that the rest of the buffers transition in on, so through to January 1, 2019. So there is no need for us to overreact and race to compliance.
So we would do much as we have done over the course of the last two years, which is balance continuing to make good progress getting to wherever it is that we need to be, which we are not going to get at at this moment, against the desire to want to continue to deliver capital to the shareholders in the form of increased dividends and repurchases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, you all have the forecast where CET1 goes up to 10.5%, 10.8% or something like that. When that new CCAR rules come out we'll probably go fine-tune what it might look like at the end of 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I mean the reality of the situation is sitting at 10.1%; we are in good company with the rest of the industry in the context that just given how CCAR operates it is highly likely that there will be overall accretion to capital in the industry over the course of 2015 and we will be no exception. So we will continue to accrete capital up towards and potentially above our 10.5%. But we are not going to recalibrate a target until we understand the rules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, and (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And (multiple speakers) one thing on the target, just when you see the rules yourself know that in our 50 to 100 basis point buffer the reason why we had a range was to allow in part for some of uncertainty and things evolving. And so, we would obviously want to fine-tune and put a finer point on our buffer. So it is possible that our buffer may not be as high as 100% too. So we will deal with all of that when the rules come out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And we have also been, remember, very careful the purpose here is to protect and grow the client franchise, meet the regulatory agenda and then we will adjust to all of these changes as they take place. The big ones we're going to know by the end of the year, TLAC, G-SIB and new CCAR.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CCAR, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And Marianne, just on that point, you had some RWA inflation in the first half as you waited some model approvals you are waiting for I believe. Where are you on those model approvals and your expectations for kind of the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets as we move forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you would have seen our other where it came down slightly in the quarter from the second quarter on the back of model improvement and on data and portfolio runoff. So we are starting to see that bend now. It is the case that as we project forward to the end of 2015 the number that we showed you at Investor Day is still relatively good. It is probably a little higher than that. We said [1.5%] it will be support between 1.5% and 1.55% by the end of next year.
We are not in complete control around the timing of model approvals. We obviously are doing everything we can to be timely and then the regulators need adequate time to approve them. So we have kind of been a little bit more conservative potentially about the duration it takes to get models approved. But we are still on that same basic trajectory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [28]

Glenn Schorr, ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So first question on -- deposit growth has been growth and I guess I would love to see higher rates in loan growth. But you are positively positioned for the parallel shift up. I guess my first question is how does that change in more of a flattening environment that we are experiencing right now? Do you capture most of the benefit anyway just getting off zero on the short end?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I mean, yes, there is a significant benefit. If you look at our disclosures you can kind of see the short end versus long end impact. Basically there is a significant benefit coming off of the short end. So we would expect to capture a significant portion of that in the first 12 months. But we obviously are looking for a more normal curve overall over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Just a -- I know we are not supposed to read too too much into it, but in everyone's mid-cycle [DFAST] results I think everyone was calling for -- or the big banks were calling for higher losses and lower PPNR in general relative to your own self test from the previous year.
Is that conservatism? Because it is a little different relative to the commentary about an improving economy, a little bit better loan growth, good expense control, things like that. I'm just curious what we are supposed to take away from that mid-cycle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously not to comment on everybody else's results, but our results were -- in terms of the size of the economic downturn, they were relatively in line. And our results were relatively in line with a few minor sort of enhancements to our process. So we weren't actually looking for materially changed results in our midyear DFAST.
So obviously we haven't had instructions yet, we are expecting them absolutely eminently, possibly as early as this week. In terms of guidance from the regulators on how to think about the bank holding company scenario for 2015 CCAR, to the degree that there are more and more stressful idiosyncratic losses or stresses on leverage or other things it could have an impact. But we have to wait and see.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, okay, last one. There are a couple of articles on rewriting of banker's agreements between major dealers to resolve some of the early termination rights issues, which obviously is going towards the Fed's issues on living wills.
A, did that actually happen or is that just being talked about? And B, does it resolve the issue in the Fed's -- I know you can't speak for the Fed, but does it resolve the issue or do you still have the client side to deal with over time?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, Mark Carney of the FSB and the Bank of England Chairman said that two major things remain to finish kind of the too big to fail issues. One is how you deal with derivatives and the second is TLAC, and both of those will be done this year. This is the thing, has been done, it is a great example -- I think it was 18 firms who got together and came up in a very complex way globally had to deal with this in a way that the regulators.
And the Fed put out a press release and Mark Carney has been very positive about it and it was industry led. So we do think it does solve that issue. So all of the buy side will do it. It will be -- eventually all the sell side -- I mean the other way around, all the buy side will eventually want to do it because it is actually better for the business as a whole.
May be not better for one trading desk, but it is better for the business as a whole and it is a little coercive. So that the regulators are basically saying that to do further derivatives you are going to have to adopt these new rules. And we think over time a lot of people will do it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And just one thing there, the [GA] team does sort of break the back of the problem, but we are still awaiting actual regulatory guidance. So there is still the strong possibility that the guidance will be broader and we would encourage it to be broader, if nothing else for simplicity purposes, not necessarily because the GA team alone don't really achieve the results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. And we're also in a position where even if the buy side doesn't for some reason, that we would be able to manage that risk over time and it would diminish over time because they're the short duration of the derivatives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. And as long as the Fed counts that as, quote, material progress by July 15 I'm cool with it too. Thanks.

Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, a couple of questions. One is on just RWAs in general. There were some articles around potentially shifting some of the repo activity to more of an agent role than principal role. I don't know if that is one of the ways that you could potentially have a light impact maybe on RWAs but on total footings to help with the ratios. Is that something that is being considered?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so, I mean, our repo business is, as you know, substantially client driven and our clients are very interested in ensuring that they are giving us sufficient wallets to allow us to dedicate sufficient balance sheet to their business. So in that sense we continue to see repo as a strategic product for our client and a scarce resource, quite frankly.
So, it is obviously the case that as we understand new rules that meanwhile leverage rules have been for a while and we've seen leverage reduce in the industry overall. But we continue to have a strong and healthy repo business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would you be supportive of an industry move towards shifting repo to more of a CCP environment or no?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are okay with the higher margins, generalized margin rules. And if they go to kind of a tri-party CCP thing that will be fine too. And it would alleviate other issues at that point in time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean between the CCP and I think the FSC even put out a framework last night that talked about cross industry including nonfinancial standardized higher levels of haircut that we are supportive of. So I think the combination of those two things achieve a great deal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, no, that is great. I asked the question in part because as people are concerned about things like the SIFI buffer increasing and other regulatory capital requirements, I'm just trying to tease out what other options you have to do your client facing business but yet maybe shrink the footings in a way that deal with these ratios without having to, quote/unquote, break up the bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so, I mean I think, Betsy, we would -- we will do exactly with this what we have done with everyone else to date which is overall we are only going to put our balance sheet to work and allow our clients to use it if the overall relationship over time pays us a sufficient return for that.
We have the ability to do that somewhat methodically and so we are being very surgical and very strategic about how we use our balance sheet. But it is a core strategic product for many of our clients and they want to continue to be able to do that.
So, yes, we could, I mean if you look at the numbers, however you want to cut them, there is -- within our repo business we do have a match book, we have inventory financing as well, we have client suites in our short-term wholesale funding. So there are things we could do, we just don't want to overreact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks. And then just separately on the payments discussion. In your prepared remarks, Marianne, you highlighted that you are delighted to work with Apple Pay but that you are also working on some other things yourself. Could you speak to what other things you are doing independently?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So, I mean we talked before and you will see more over the coming few months about our own wallet and payment capability so [Chase pay] and Quick Checkout where we would provide the capability for our customers to be able to have a much more seamless experience. Also for merchants to have a lower abandonment rate and continuing with the safety and security of tokenization and other methods.
So we are continuing to work on our own proprietary wallet and payment capabilities that will be piloted and then subsequently launched over the course of the next coming months. And then as obviously the case that we are out of pilot and in production on our end-to-end capability including [Chase net].
So we are signing up merchants at a faster rate than we expected and, again, you will hear more about that later. But our ability to now negotiate bilaterally economics with merchants and provide customers with compelling reasons to continue to bring share to us is also something we are working on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So our basic philosophy has been that you, the customer, who want to be able to use your debit cards, your credit cards in a way that you want and that we want to make it available to you whether it is Apple Pay, in-store apps, other people's wallets, Visa wallet, our own wallet -- all which will have benefits, etc.
And as Marianne said, we think that we can also be friendly to merchants with data, with pricing, with simplified contracts. So we are trying to make this an ecosystem that works better for everybody and is far more secure. I have customers on both sides and I'm far more secure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I think is it accurate, Jamie, that you mentioned at a recent conference that you were looking to double the spend in cyber security, is that right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I was just estimating it, I was taking a guess that it will double over the next four or five years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I think it is fair to say, Betsy, that what we are seeing inside the space, not surprisingly, is this relentless constant and evolving set of attacks and we need to be constantly evolving and constantly vigilant in response. So it is entirely reasonable to assume that we will continue to increase our investment over the course of the next several years and we'll -- so it will be larger and we will let you know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I mean tokenization --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I should clarify that was quoted in the press not accurately because this is one area where the government and businesses have been collaborating really well. And for a long time of course all these government agencies -- and I think we need that because the government sees all kind of attacks and they have a -- they are a fountain of information.
And then also the industry itself collaborates, which is we share information with other banks immediately when we see something happening. So maybe even if something happens to you, you can help one of your brethren avoid a problem like that.
And then cyber goes beyond just yourself. It's making sure that all of your vendors you deal with have proper cyber control, that all the exchanges have proper cyber control. So this is -- we have identified this as a huge effort. We've been very good at it until this recent breach, which we are not going to make excuses for. We will invest any and all things we need to do to get it right.
Our customers are protected, which is critical, but we don't want these things to be happening. But it is going to be a battle. We have already seen a lot of very, very serious -- far more serious than personal data being taken where Social Security numbers, security codes, account numbers, etc.
And we do think that unfortunately there are going to be some wins and losses in this. This is not going to be one of those things where it is going to be absolute and we don't want to be sitting here saying you can absolutely be protected because we think that will put you in a false sense of security.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those are all great points. I mean, you could imagine tokenization moving beyond just payments to any interface with clients at some point?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Tokenization will be more broadly used and that avoids a certain type of fraud, but not other types of fraud. So you have to look at each one of these things and say, what does it accomplish.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And that certainly helps across the payment space, but there are other areas of vulnerability, obviously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Appreciate --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And there is (inaudible) security about who came to what systems, when they use private computers with private lines as opposed to public computers from home. There are all these things we're all doing and we've had some great people come in, audit us, and this is one area I suggest to most companies, get someone to come in who is an expert at this. We have our own attacker system where we have our own people trying to get through. So we are always trying to look where we might have a weak spot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to follow-up first of all on the question that Glenn asked about the change in the derivatives contracts. From your perspective doesn't this fundamentally render the contract less attractive for users because of the loss of the automatic bankruptcy preference? And if so, would you expect this is one more potential pressure on the derivatives revenues that you've talked about in the past potentially depressing your revenues by as much as $1 billion?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think it makes it less attractive. For the one reason if you look at one contract that someone may have in one fund or someone like that yes, it may make it slightly less attractive. But if you look at the improved safety of the system I think it makes it more attractive.
So, if people believe that doing this makes whole system safer, every institution will say well, on the one contract side I would prefer to have the optionality, but for the total I like the fact the system is protected and we have time to work all this out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So if the resolution works that is really, really good for everybody. I mean everybody would have preferred that there was a resolution process in place for Lehman. The pain and suffering would have been far less across derivatives even though they didn't have the same -- they had more protection derivatives at the time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And while we are on that topic then, another thing that happened during the quarter obviously was the Fed and FDIC rejecting the living wills. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what changes that might have provoked from your point of view in terms of accelerating some of the simplifications that you were talking about earlier?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I think just an important point of clarification for what it is worth is that the FDIC found the industry's 2013 plans not credible, the Fed did not. So it wasn't a joint agency conclusion that point. And so, we haven't had comments on the 2014 plan yet.
Having said that we, talking for JPMorgan, we made substantial progress even between the 2013 and 2014 submissions. We are in dialogue with our regulators to understand even more detail of what they found as being the limitations or the vulnerabilities in our credibility of the plan. And we are committed to remediating them by 2015.
It has had little bearing on our business simplification agenda because it was already a very broad and appropriate agenda. But we continue to work on all number of things around the place, [crystal] operations, legal entity simplification and we will continue to do so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember the FSB led by Mark Carney has made it -- be said publicly that the two big remaining pieces are TLAC, which should be done this year, and the derivative stay that would be common harmonization around the globe. And those two pieces are going to be in place and make resolution much more achievable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right and we should add that obviously the [Issa] protocol was specifically pointed out in that feedback and the industry voluntarily resolved the issue I think very well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, fair enough. I mean I think a lot of times the press reports forget to pull together all the pieces like that. I hate to beat the regulatory horse too hard here, but one of the things that we were hearing towards the end of the quarter was that our clients were telling us that they were seeing a significant fall off in liquidity in some aspect of the credit markets in particular.
And I was wondering, is there any link between that and some of the new filings that you have had to start doing on a daily basis for -- not just you, but obviously all the dealers on liquidity? And I think some of the Volcker data gathering has started as well. And I was wondering if there was any linkage there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. So I mean, my point of view on this is that while we have started doing the filing more recently we have been well aware of the requirement for a reasonably long if not very long period of time and have reoriented our business to be compliant in substance with the requirements.
So the fact that we are producing metrics at this point isn't having meaningful impact on our business. It is the case that over the course of the next year between now and the compliance date next July, we do expect to, as an industry, receive feedback on that data and we will have to see how that progresses. But it is our point of view that our business is compliant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that helps. The last one for me -- sorry, go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Industry wide as people pushed LCR and capital and some of these rules down to the trading desk that we did see a reduction in inventories, etc. But our view is that market making is a critical role in society and it has to take place. We have 16,000 clients and so we really do focus on serving those clients.
We electrified more of it, some of it will go to clearinghouses, some of it will be -- but we want to be there for the clients. And you will see how the industry sorts out. Some people in the industry are making much more drastic decisions than others. Our decision has been to be there to make markets and just try to adjust to the new rules which may make it a little bit more costly to trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But what I think you hear you saying is that the recent imposition of some of these reporting requirements did not in itself have those liquidity impacts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it wasn't the reporting requirements, I think it was pushing down of LCR, the cost of capital, the cost of debt and the traders reduced their balance sheets a little bit and they were a little more cautious how they use a balance sheet. And that is industry wide. And then some people said we simply can't stay in these areas. I have seen people exit certain trading areas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I mean, repo is a good example of that where the level of, not concern, but the level of dialogue with clients around our willingness to continue to commit our balance sheet to that business has increased because others are less willing. And so, we are seeing some of that for sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And then the last one for me -- Marianne, you gave some clarification around loan growth in the CIB. But I am not sure I quite understood it. Basically you said the minus 5% headline number was affected by a couple of it sounded like one time-ish kind of things and what the underlying was. But as I said, I'm not sure I really caught your drift.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, okay so let me give you the down piece of it. One of them is not timing, it is just a continuation of a trend where trade finance loans are down substantially year over year (technical difficulty). And so when you look at it the overall loan balance is being impacted by trade, markedly. And then on the client overdraft side, that is something that is a little bit lumpier, you see.
So those two things driving it down. But the point to the comment was a little bit -- not to trivialize reported loan growth, which was still positive, but with those masking underlying performance in our credit portfolio and HFI loans. So our more traditional credit lending continues to grow and grow at 10% plus pace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thanks very much.

Operator    [81]

Gerard Cassidy, RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you share with us -- obviously the federal reserve is asking for more capital for all the larger global SIFI type banks. What is the minimum cushion would you guys be comfortable running against? You mentioned your 50 to 100 basis points might be a little less. How low would you go in your cushion for meeting those new capital guidelines when they come out down the road?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I think a reasonable point of view on that would be at the lower end of that range, at the 50 basis points. So remember, when we -- obviously we will refine it and we will update you. But when we have thoughts about having a buffer it is there in order to protect us from a range of issues including capital volatility driven by AOCI.
We regularly and routinely stress our portfolio to understand how much stress we could see in AOCI in a short period of time and that is going to be one of the principal drivers. So I would say is that a reasonable sort of benchmark for the level that we would go to.
That doesn't mean we have to have that buffer in totality. As I said, buffers phase in between now and January of 2019. So whatever we decide it is, however we communicate that to you, that as well of all of the other buffers, capital conservation buffer and G-SIB we will phase in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And CCAR may still be a limiting factor, so --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean the reality -- as Jamie said, the reality is that the way CCAR is operating, while there has been good progress in the communication and dialogue with the regulator, the reality remains that it is still not clear, either quantitatively or qualitatively, exactly how everything is working and therefore it is unlikely to be the case that in this cycle that you are going to see 100% or greater than 100% distribution. That is my view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. No, regarding the return on equity, at Investor Day you guys gave us the through the cycle target of 15% to 16%. Clearly I would assume that in this year's Investor Day when it comes up, if these capital levels are even higher now than what you originally thought when you gave that guidance, it probably will be a bit lower.
What lines of business do you think will see the lower ROE targets, if you decide that you need to lower it through the cycle from the 15% to 16% that you gave us last year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so, I mean, just before we sort of get onto the business-by-business lens on it, I mean the reality mathematically is obviously true that if we have higher capital we would prima facie defacto have lower returns. But the reality hasn't been that way over time. So you know acutely that we have added significant capital over the last however many years and have been able to, over time, continue to reorient the business and optimize against it to deliver strong returns.
So could there be a decline in returns. Obviously we will have to see what the rules look like. Clearly at the moment the most clear and present danger relates to higher G-SIB surcharges on short-term wholesale funding. So in the first quarter impact of it would obviously have an impact on directing those businesses and products in the CIB. But obviously if the Company is holding more capital we will look more broadly.
But I don't think it is a foregone conclusion that you are going to see a pro rata decline in our returns. And obviously we are continuing to focus on our expenses in making sure that the overall business is as efficient as possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it fair to say that today's ROE in today's quarter of about 10% -- which obviously is below your through the cycle number -- is it primarily an interest rate issue that is holding it back or is there some other issue - the high elevated expenses that you are running due to all the new regulations and stuff?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I mean our 10% ROE, 13% ROTCE, remember the target is an ROTCE target. It's obviously -- right now in 2014 we are in a bit of a cyclical low in a number of ways and elevated expenses. So it is cyclical lows in mortgage, at least for the first half of the year cyclical lows and some secular headwinds in the market space.
Yes, we are reaching a peak in terms of control expenses, so that is in part contributing reserve releases are lower albeit that credit remains benign, but at a relative matter they are lower. But we are staring efficiencies in the face across our businesses over the course of the next two years.
So control costs will decline, CCB will deliver improvements in expense, CIB will also, rates will be a meaningful piece. Clearly you've seen our sensitivity to rising rates is relatively significant, but it is not the only piece. When the economy generally recovers, when loan growth recovers and volatility recovers, all those things, good things happen.

Shifting gears, if we look at leverage lending the federal reserve has come out recently concerned about some of the underwriting that is going on there. And I think they even pointed out that leverage lending now will be used in CCAR possibly from a qualitative standpoint. Can you guys give us any color on what your understanding is of what is going on with leverage lending today? And will it be included in CCAR?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to talk about what will be included in CCAR, the truth is we don't know. So what you have seen we have also read. But that doesn't constitute any kind of guidance. We haven't received guidance yet, so we are going to have to wait to see that. It wouldn't be entirely surprising if there was some sort of leverage stress in there quantitatively; I can't speak to qualitatively.
And then, yes, there has been more stringent guidance on leverage lending from the regulators over the course of the last year. And we have taken a fairly strict line on applying that. So it has in part been one of the reasons why we believe we have seen lower loan growth in some of our business than we would otherwise have seen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You guys mentioned (multiple speakers) yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And it is going to get a little stricter on the refi part of the leverage loans. And obviously whatever the terms are, we will meet the terms and some of that business will go to nonbanks or some banks who are not regulated by the OCC and the Fed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You guys gave some very good numbers on the mobile app usage by your customers. What is the penetration rate of your customer base that uses that mobile app?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is still relative to 20-million-something customers in -- households and 23 million, something like that, households in the retail sales space is still relatively low. From recollection, and we will check the numbers for you, I think it is in that 2 million to 3 million range. But nevertheless -- no?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mobile was much higher than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mobile is higher? Okay, we will get back to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay. And then finally. you guys talked about Apple Pay --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry, I'm sorry --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- can you show --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry, it's 18 million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it is 18 million out of --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know is that individuals or households? It's a huge amount.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You guys mentioned Apple Pay and the opportunities there. What are some of the -- where could you see the growth? But at the same time where can Apple Pay cannibalize some of your businesses or are there any that will be cannibalized?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look, again, our view is to, if you are a client and you want to use your Apple phone to pay with NFC at a merchant, that is fine, we don't want to say you can't use your JPMorgan Chase credit card or debit card. And like we said, we're going to be in other people's wallets too. And we're going to have our own which we think will have some competitive advantage.
So will it cannibalize? Sure. But we are not against cannibalizing our own business or disrupting ourselves if we are building a better business and are gaining share. Our goal to gain share. We do believe a little bit in -- you know when Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity, we want to be the people that are coming up with the new ideas and stuff that are getting more of our customers using our stuff and happier. And if it reduces certain margins somewhere, so be it.

A follow-up on the loan question from before. You mentioned a little bit more caution with leverage loans. In the past you said you didn't want to compete too much in the commercial space if it's getting too competitive. There's been some current concerns about auto lending with regulators.
So my question is, slide 1 highlights that your core loans are up 1% quarter over quarter and the same slide in the second quarter said that core loans were up 4% quarter over quarter. So my question is, are you simply getting more cautious in the loans that you provide or is there a little bit less demand in the market? Really trying to get to is loan growth decelerating?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, look, if you look at year-over-year trends, they continue to be in the -- I mean I think the first quarter year over year was 4%, 8% in the second, 7% in the third. I think we are not expecting those year-over-year tends to decelerate.
Obviously quarter over quarter things can be impacted just by the timing of closing loans. So fundamentally I would say, no, we aren't seeing significant deceleration quarter over quarter within continued relative momentum. Solid across the board with obviously more challenges in the C&I space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separately your expense guidance is now for over $58 billion, you said some of that is due to comp. Is any of that increase in guidance due not to comp?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relative to the 58 plus or minus that [was being said], no, it is principally in higher revenues on higher market performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We always said that might be the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we are meeting our overhead numbers and the comp itself will bounce around a little bit. Remember, in the old days we used to break out IB comp in total for that reason. But --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, separate -- yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sorry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [121]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separately which capital ratio is your binding constraint? And using that ratio, what should we use in our model three years out? And I know that's a tough question with all the moving parts, but what is your best guess?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So just in terms of what is our binding constraint at the moment, it is CET1, so Basel III advanced capital, risk-based capital at the margin. So it is not to say that the other ratios leverage liquidity and the like aren't [comfortably] around it. But that -- and even stress capital. But that is currently our binding constraint.
It is very hard for us to give us a point of view where you should do this new model three years out when we are staring potentially new rules in the face in the next two months. As I said earlier, we are expecting over the course of the next 12 months that we will continue to accrete capital at 2% or above our 10.5% which is basically in-line with what you guys all have in your models.
Beyond that it is our expectation that, hopefully anyway, putting new rules aside that by the time we are in our fourth or fifth cycle of CCAR when you've made substantial industry wide progress in the sort of non-quantitative aspects of CCAR where we have more credible resolutions and the like that we will be able to me more aggressive in our ability to seek capital distribution capability.
So outside of any changes in rules we would hope at the end of 2015 into 2016 CCAR to be able to have -- payout ratios are much higher. But we will have to see.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then last question. On the supplement page 6, this is a smaller item, but it just kind of stands out. Your rate on trading liabilities declined from 48 basis points down to 12 basis points in just three months. Is there anything unusual there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, there is. So about half of that I would call -- approximately half of that I would call relatively normal, but included in that result there is actually a one-time item associated with accounting for the previous interest accrual that we released in the quarter, which is one time. You should expect that interest expense to go back up next quarter to something more normal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And how much -- what was the dollar amount of that impact?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little less than $100 million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. All right, thank you.

Erika Najarian, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [129]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to follow up with two quick questions. The first is, Marianne, if we put together everything that you have said on expenses so far in this call, is it fair to assume that without rates the efficiency -- adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% can continue to improve in 2015 and 2016?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah. So I think -- yes, it is our -- it is our belief that we should be able to manage the ratio to be stable to improving over time, ultimately getting down to something much more in the mid-50%, but that is dependent on revenue growth associated with rates but not limited to rates.
So in the absence of rate but, by the way just to point out, that it is still our case that based upon continued improvement in the domestic rate economy that rates will start to rise in the middle of next year. But having said that, even without rates we would hope to be able to continue to maintain the discipline to have that ratio be broadly flat to down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [131]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And the second follow-up question is, given your expectations for rates to rise in the middle of next year are you still -- and the progress that you -- continued progress you make on deposit share are you still expecting $100 billion in deposit outflows in that case?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [132]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So since we talked about the $100 billion estimated deposit outflows associated with liquidity draining out of the system, remember that was predicated on believing that it was possible that the Fed would use the reverse repo program much more -- in much more size than is likely to be the case today for two reasons.
One is that obviously they have made changes to the term deposit facility that allows them to now be LCR eligible, which is helpful in terms of providing another tool in their toolkit.
And the second is that in September, as you know, the RRP was capped in total at $300 billion. That cap may or may not be permanent. I'm sure it will be recalibrated over time. But it looks like it will be unlikely to reach the $1 billion that would have driven the $100 billion -- the $100 billion -- sorry the $1 trillion that would have driven the $100 billion.
So. you can make your decision about whether it is $300 million or $500 million in the fullness of time and scale our operating deposit outflows back relative to that, knowing of course that it is already in operation at $300 billion right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [133]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, appreciate that the repo book is substantially client driven. Was maybe hoping that you guys could give us some sense for how much of your repo book is firm financing versus facilitation?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Brennan, we haven't disclosed that. I would -- a large chunk of it is client driven, that is what we will say.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [137]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, worth a shot.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [138]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large chunk -- a larger chunk of it -- the larger chunk of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [139]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [140]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have also lengthened the firm financing part of it --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [141]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [142]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- to be more compliant with LCR, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that is fair. And I just wanted to try to square something here and maybe I am reading just a little too much into it. You had said that October on the capital markets side has been a bit mixed. But you have also at the same time brought up your expense guidance and it seems like it is driven by expected or potentially a component of comp and capital markets.
So are those two at odds? Are you just more optimistic that maybe what we're seeing here in October is not necessarily some sort of dramatic shift but a temporary bout in bad volatility? Or how can we square those two?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I would square it in two ways. The first is already did have a better performance in the third quarter then would have been anticipated in our previous guidance given that that guidance was given during the sort of harder times of the second quarter. So that is already in our run rate so to speak in terms of the comp that would accrue to that.
And then if you sort of go back and, in the fullness of time, look at the transcript, I did say if the performance continues into the fourth quarter. So it will depend.
We have always said, and evidently maybe we should strip out comp from our adjusted expenses. But we have always said that the adjusted expense absolute number in any period is obviously going to be calibrated to the performance of the market-related businesses. And clearly you would wave in good revenues every day at a 32% comp to revenue ratio. So that is really all we were saying, nothing more subtle than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [146]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, okay, thanks for that. And then appreciate that there is not much color potentially to be added on this charge tied to FX. But just is it possible to let us know if it is tied to a particular geography?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [147]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, no, it is not possible to talk about it in any more detail, I am afraid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's just -- suffice to say that we are working with a number of regulators across a number of jurisdictions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [150]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right, that is fair. And then last one for me. So in looking at the NIM simulation that you guys have provided, and then taking a look at that in light of the interest rate shock disclosures you've got in your Q's, it looks like a 200 basis point rate shock adds about half of what you are looking for in a normalized rate environment.
So I guess does that mean that subsequent years sort of the benefit of rolling the portfolio into higher rates is going to exceed the higher deposit cost by about $4 billion to $5 billion? And then is there a particular time period that we should think about that or is it going to be too heavily influenced by competitive dynamics?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [151]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you are right that when you roll forward beyond the first 12 months you do get the benefit of being able to continue to reinvest deposits as they mature up the curve in terms of their invest -- the underlying investment. So that is the compounding effect of what you are seeing in our earnings and risk shock.
But what we showed I think in -- I'm going to cease to recall it, but maybe it was in the Barclays conference in 2013 -- is that you would expect once rates start to rise, if they rise in a somewhat expected fashion. So obviously it depends on what rate [party] you want to put on that, that you could expect the cumulative NII to be in our [impact] in three to four years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [152]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember the benefit is more for the first hundred, a little bit less the second hundred, a little bit less the third hundred, a little bit less the fourth hundred, because there is increasing repricing of deposits at that level. And we don't know exactly what the yield curve will be four years out, but --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [153]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [154]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And also we do embed in that our own estimates of competition and repricing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [155]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [156]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [157]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That is a very good point actually, Brennan. Our scenario does contemplate not only a more normal loan to deposit ratio, more normal interest bearing versus non-interest-bearing deposit and also a higher (inaudible) on retail deposits just given the LCR competitive dynamics, technology advances and the like. So to the best of our ability we've tried to bake that in and that is included in our number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, sure. Okay, thanks, that is fair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ken Usdin, Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [160]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A tactical follow-up just on the balance sheet. With the non-interest-bearing deposits basically being the fastest growing category of the balance sheet and the resulting asset, the deposit with banks also being the fastest-growing asset on the balance sheet.
Just within that context of what you just walked through with Brennan, I am just wondering what changes structurally with the way you think about reinvesting in the securities portfolio with rates as low as they are now. Loan growth is okay, but to your point you are being somewhat selective on -- and want to be careful with pricing and credit.
So, just from a -- more so taking the next year or so out, how are your thoughts changing at all with respect to what you do with these deposits given that they might actually not flow out as much given that change to the ROP function?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [161]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. So the deposit -- so in part not totality, in part the deposits that were likely to outflow through the RRP were non-operating deposits. And non-operating deposits we do not count for significant liquidity value in the Firm; we fundamentally have them on deposit at central banks at the Fed.
And so, if they stay -- we will come back to whether we would be willing to let them stay, but if they stay they will continue to basically be treated in that way. And they are not included in terms of our assumption around asset sensitivity and forward-looking NII.
Obviously over time we are in the same way as we talked about repo we are looking at non-operating deposits for our clients in the context of their overall relationship. And so, that is another valuable use of our balance sheet with leverage capital and the like against it. And in the fullness of time we will expect the overall relationship to pay for that. But we are going to wait and see some of those dynamics play out.
So other than that I'll just go back to the earlier comments I made that we do have a high level of HQLA, not in [cash], not in securities, but it is in order to make sure that we have adequate liquidity both under our own stresses most importantly, but also under LCR and NSFR. And we feel good and at modest buffers relative to them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [162]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the typical quarter end a lot of large clients leave a lot of deposits here which obviously are not necessarily good for us in terms of LCR or capital, etc., and we will be looking at how we manage those client relationships over time too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [163]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood, okay. And (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [164]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other thing you remember of the securities portfolio is that as rates go up the duration of that extends on its own.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [165]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman, President & CEO    [166]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And so, we will be managing that. And, yes, we might invest it longer at one point, but we are in a very conservative position right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, okay. Got it. And then secondly, just two quick ones on mortgage. Default servicing costs have pretty much stabilized the last couple of quarters at a good level that you had talked about getting down to $500 million total by the fourth. And I am just wondering how much more room is there given that improvement in underlying trends that you're continuing to see for that to be a benefit to that cost side of the equation going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we are continuing to see credit trends improve, delinquencies come down, modification pipelines -- all the metrics are coming down. Obviously they are coming down from a much smaller place this year than that were last and the year before. So the pace of improvement or the relative pace is slower.
But we are expecting that to continue down through $500 million and into the $400 million's in 2015. And then just more longer-term, you know that we are focused on ensuring that through the next cycle we have a smaller delinquency portfolio. And so, a more normal level would be substantially less than this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [169]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And I noticed that your (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [170]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, that is a longer-term view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [171]

Yes. And I noticed also that underneath the origination improvement this quarter there was a decent jump in correspondent. I am just not -- I just wanted to ask if you are doing anything differently in terms of market share opportunities on the mortgage side now that things have shaken out a little bit or any change in your underlying philosophy on where you are looking at originations?

Yes. So I mean we talked last quarter about the fact that we had loss share, a combination of things, primarily our strategy around the government mortgage space but also a little bit of share in the what I would call in our target segment. So we have made that back.
So in some part it is just continue to leverage our balance sheet properly, do very granular marginal pricing to really focus on changing and improving our customer operating processes. So across the board we just continue to get very granular and try and be as competitive as we can.

Marianne, I appreciated the color you had given on the RWA guidance. I suppose one thing that we have been hearing from a lot of clients, or at least concern from clients, is this notion of regulatory gold plating. Essentially the us regulators adopting tougher standards than those that are being enforced in other areas around the globe.
And I just wanted to get a sense as to how that is informing your thinking about RWA mitigation plans. You reaffirmed the guidance at Investor Day, but what should we expect in the event that a tougher capital as well as TLAC requirement is in fact enforced against US G-SIBs?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [176]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, just to be very clear, it may be slightly -- (inaudible) slightly higher than Investor Day in terms of our guidance. So, look, obviously any guidance that we give you, and no good deed goes unpunished, but any guidance we give you is always predicated on based upon what we know today. And so, if something changes that would change that point of view we will obviously have to recalibrate it.
But just prima fascia having the requirement to have extra long-term debt or loss absorbing capital and/or capital wouldn't necessarily prima fascia change the overall RWA we have. I mean you have to be careful to ensure that by having higher levels of capital there's not an incentive to want to stretch in the credit box, but we have very tight credit discipline. So I wouldn't see that being a material change in the outlook. But obviously if there is a change in rules that directly affect RWA that would do.

All right, thank you. That is very helpful. And then just switching gears to the investment banking outlook that you had given. I appreciated the color which sounded quite constructive on the backlogs for M&A and ECM. And I guess not just you but the industry in general hasn't given much commentary on the outlook for debt capital markets activity.
It has been challenged this year. I think that was something which many of us had expected just given the strength that we had experienced over the last couple of years. But I didn't know if you can just provide some updated thoughts on that revenue stream in particular.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [178]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I mean, look, it is the case that a lot of refinancing has already happened, so the debt maturity wall is smaller, although rates are lower than we may have expected at this point in time. So I would -- so, therefore yes, it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be some continued headwinds. But having said that, I think there is going to be windows of opportunity. So we are going to -- M&A and ECM are more constructive and likely to be buoyant, but I think debt capital market still has windows of opportunity.
