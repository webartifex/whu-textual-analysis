Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter 2014 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you Operator, good morning everybody. As of right now, I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements which is at the back of the presentation.
Starting on page 1, the Firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the first quarter, $1.28 a share, with a return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $24 billion, down 8% year on year driven by lower markets revenue, down 17%, and continued headwinds in mortgage. Reported expenses for the Firm were basically the same as adjusted expenses this quarter at $14.6 billion, in line with our expectations and our guidance for full-year adjusted expenses to be below $59 billion. Firm-wide legal expense for the quarter was immaterial.
Of note, you will see that we didn't disclose any significant items this quarter on the front page of the presentation. There were items in the quarter that we consider non-core or non-recurring. Each individually didn't rise to the level of being disclosed on the front page, and importantly, the net of all such items across businesses was not significant to the Firm's reported results. To be clear, this means our reported net income of $5.3 billion is very close to being a core performance number, which we consider a solid result given the challenging environment for both markets and mortgage. Importantly, underlying drivers across most businesses continued along impressive trends.
Finally, we're pleased that our capital plan was approved in the quarter, and the Board announced its intention to increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 a share effective in the second quarter, as well as the authorization to repurchase a gross $6.5 billion of common equity, or net a little over $5 billion, that's net of expected employee issuance.
So skipping over page 2 and turning to page 3. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.5%, flat to last quarter, being over 40 basis points of capital generated and run-off in the quarter, largely offset by the impact of certain specific risk models that were approved for use in Basel I last year, but which our regulators disapproved for use under Basel III effective at the beginning of this year. We believe it should largely be timing with partial remediation in the second half of 2014 and further remediation in 2015. The impact of these models approvals was contemplated in our Investor Day guidance of reaching 10% plus by the year end, but it won't be in a linear fashion and the majority of capital accretion will occur in the second half of the year.
Effective this quarter our regulatory reported ratio moves from a Basel I measure to a Basel III standardized transitional measure, and having been approved to exit Basel parallel effective April 1, starting in the second quarter, the common floor would apply. This means that there are a variety of measures we could talk about, but suffice to say that we're hundreds of basis points above the minimum for any of them. Therefore, our primary ratio will continue to be the one we used to manage the place, which also happens to be our lowest, the fully phased-in Basel III advance ratio of 9.5%.
Before we leave the page I want to spend a minute on leverage. You'll notice that the Firm and the bank SLR progressed by 50 and 70 basis points, respectively, and importantly, that the Firm is above 5% today. The Firm's ratio benefited from net retained earnings as well as from preferred issuance of close to $4 billion, as we took advantage of market opportunities in the first quarter. The bank's ratio benefited from both retained earnings as well as the impact of actions taken, including downstreaming and restructuring certain capital for the bank.
Additionally, other leverage actions taken across our businesses helped the Firm and the bank by 10 basis points. We also analyzed the rule proposed by regulators this past Tuesday. In general it was relatively consistent with the Basel proposal, which is how we based our estimates. There were a couple of nuanced technical changes. The net of those changes we estimated to add approximately 15 to 20 basis points to leverage, which is included in the ratios reported on the page.
Turning to the business performance and moving on to Page 4, for Consumer and Community Banking. The combined Consumer businesses generated $1.9 billion of net income for the quarter on $10.5 billion of revenue and an ROE of 15%. Overall, revenue was down both year on year and quarter on quarter, driven by Mortgage Banking, which I will talk about later.
Despite margin compression across CCB, excluding mortgage, revenue was flat year on year as we continued to add new customers and deepen our relationships with them. Deposits were up $30 billion year on year. We had record client investment assets of $196 billion, up 16%, and credit card sales volume of $105 billion was up 10% year on year being the 24th consecutive quarter that sales outperformed the industry.
Expense was down $350 million year on year and close to $900 million quarter on quarter, despite the ongoing investment in controls. The reduction was also driven by mortgage, as well as by the timing of certain investments in marketing and card. And across CCB, we are on track relative to our headcount reduction outlined at Investor Day.
On Page 5, Consumer and Business Banking. Business generated $740 million of net income and an ROE of 27% on $4.4 billion of net revenue, up 5% year on year and down 1% from the prior quarter seasonally. Net interest income was up over 5% year on year, driven by deposit growth of 9%, among the highest in the industry; we saw strong household growth and the lowest attrition ever this quarter. While the deposit margin flattened quarter over quarter, it did decline 9 basis points over last year, driven by lower reinvestment rates.
On the non-interest revenue side, we continued to see strong year-over-year growth in both debit and in investment revenue, driven by the record client investment assets I mentioned. Expense was up 1% year on year, reflecting investments we've made in the business, including the costs relating to strengthening the control and compliance infrastructure, partially offset by improving efficiency in our branches. CBB headcount was down around 1,500 this quarter.
On Business Banking originations we're beginning to see stronger lending, with production for the quarter of $1.5 billion, up 22% year over year and 16% quarter on quarter. We have the right team in place and targeted strategies which have proved successful. We're also seeing improved banker productivity. So although some challenges remain in the environment, the pipeline is strong and at the highest level since 2012 and utilization rates have stabilized. So we are cautiously optimistic that improved lending trends will continue in 2014.
Turning to page 6, Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $114 million for the quarter, and despite a relatively favorable rate environment, the market got off to a slow start in 2014. We're seeing tight housing inventory in some markets, and the purchase market was affected adversely by the severe weather. This led to a challenging quarter for the Mortgage business with production of $17 billion, down 27% quarter over quarter and 68% over last year.
On the back of this lower volume, production pre-tax excluding repurchases was a loss of $186 million, consistent with our guidance. We did, however, continue to make good progress on right sizing capacity and reducing expenses, with production core expense being lower by over $110 million quarter on quarter.
Total Mortgage Banking headcount was down nearly 3,000 since the end of the year and about 14,000 since the beginning of last year. Mortgage Production also benefited from a repurchase reserve release. Repurchases for the quarter was positive $128 million, principally driven by a significant improvement in actual and projected cure rates for remaining repurchase risks.
So before I move off of production, just briefly on market share. As we pointed out at Investor Day, we're pricing the business to reflect the inherent risks. The risk of default and the cost associated with servicing defaulted loans is significantly higher for high LTD loans. As a result of pricing actions taken, we believe we may have lost some share in the first quarter, but we will remain disciplined with respect to appropriate risk adjusted returns, and this is consistent with our objective to have a smaller, higher quality, less volatile mortgage business in the future.
Now on to servicing. Excluding MSR risk management, pre-tax income of $131 million was favorable by over $100 million quarter on quarter. That was driven by the absence of an adjustment to compensatory fees, which we incurred in the fourth quarter. If you exclude this item, servicing pre-tax remained relatively flat, and we remain on track to deliver servicing expense of $500 million plus or minus by the fourth quarter of this year.
MSR risk management was a net loss for the quarter of about $400 million. The loss was driven by a negative $460 million fair value adjustment, principally on higher allocated capital to the business, in line with the capital we showed at Investor Day.
Lastly on real estate portfolios, pre-tax income of $517 million includes $174 million of charge-offs and an NCI reserve release for the quarter of $200 million, in line with guidance. You'll see that net charge-offs were broadly flat to the fourth quarter on flattening delinquencies at the end of last year and the early part of the first quarter, but we do expect improvement in the loss trend to resume in the second quarter as recent delinquency trends have been positive. Lastly on mortgage, the NCI portfolio remains flat. We added $3.5 billion of loans this quarter.
Turning to page 7. Card, Merchant Services and Auto had net income of $1.1 billion, down 15% year on year with an ROE of 23%, or 20% if you exclude reserve releases. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 3% seasonally quarter on quarter and 4% year on year, driven by continued margin compression from growth in transacted balances and from the pay down of higher-yielding run-off loans. Underlying trends remain robust, strong sales and merchant processing volumes up 10% and 11%, respectively, and gaining share.
Total outstandings remained approximately flat for us and for the industry, and we have strong momentum in new account originations in the quarter, up 24% year on year, and the quality of our new account origination is very strong. Expense was down $260 million or 12% quarter on quarter, due to the timing of marketing spend as well as the absence of remediation payments to customers that was recorded in the fourth quarter.
The net charge-off rate has remained very low at 293 basis points, picking up slightly quarter on quarter just on seasonality of loan balances. We released $200 million of Card loan loss reserves this quarter in line with guidance, and $50 million of student lending reserves.
And before we move on, a few words on Auto. We saw a very strong industry rebound in March with the highest new Auto sales since 2007, coming off of the slower start to the year, again on a severe winter. This drove originations up 3% year on year and loan balances up 5%, gaining share, and it was the 10th consecutive quarter of Auto loan and lease growth.
Moving on to Slide 8 and the Corporate and Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. You'll see in the table on the top right of the slide that we've shown adjusted results for comparable periods excluding DVA and FVA. The net DVA/FVA impact for this quarter was an insignificant loss. Gross DVA would have been over $200 million negative on 9 basis points tightening of CDS spreads, so as expected what we saw was a sensitivity to our spread significantly muted given the implementation of FVA, and you should expect the impact of DVA/FVA in our results to continue to be modest going forward, all other things equal.
In Banking, total revenue was $2.7 billion down 8% year on year. IB fees were $1.4 billion, up 1% year on year, driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees but with lower debt underwriting fees, and we maintained our number-one ranking in global IB fees per Dealogic.
Going forward, the environment remains compelling for M&A with announced volumes up 20%. We have a robust pipeline of IPOs with a large backlog across sectors and regions, and DCM activity is expected to be relatively stable.
Lending revenue was down $200 million year over year and down quarter over quarter, but mark-to-market gains on securities drove the variance in both prior periods. We also had Treasury Services revenue of $1 billion, down 3% year on year, with higher net interest income on higher deposits, offset by the impact of business simplification and lower trade loans and spreads.
Moving on to markets and investor services. The challenging environment and lower client volumes we talked about at Investor Day continued through the end of the quarter, ending with overall markets revenues down 17% year on year, and there was no discernible single driver of the weakness. It was across products and regions.
In general it feels like the market consensus at the quarter beginning was for a growth story which didn't transpire, and combined with several other factors this lead to generally lower levels of client activity across the board. We didn't see a meaningful pickup in activity in March, so it's reasonable to expect that some of this first-quarter softness may continue in April.
Securities Services revenue of $1 billion was up 4% year on year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. And you see the credit adjustments and other line items showed a negative $197 million, which includes the net DVA/FVA loss together with the impact of changes in CVA.
The credit environment continues to be benign and we believe our exposure to Russia is manageable. We are appropriately reserved based on what we know today and we are closely monitoring the situation.
Expense came down 8% year on year to $5.6 billion, lower compensation given lower revenue driving the decline. The comp to revenue ratio for the quarter was 33%, broadly in line with 34% in the same quarter of last year. And finally on drivers, you can see client deposit balances were up 15% year on year, but down 2% quarter on quarter seasonally.
Moving on to Commercial Banking on page 9. This quarter saw net income of about $580 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 17%. Revenue was relatively flat year over year and declined by approximately $200 million sequentially. The sequential decline was about two-thirds NII, driven by a large recovery we reported in the prior quarter, together with lower day count. The balance of the decline was lower NIR on seasonally lower fees.
A bright spot in the quarter was gross IB revenues of $450 million for the quarter, up over 30% year on year, a record for a first quarter, and representing nearly 35% of North America IB fees. Our credit book continued to show very strong performance with a net recovery rate of 4 basis points, and expense was up 7% year on year given the investments we've been making in the business as well as the impact of costs of control and compliance.
Loan balances were up 7% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Consistent with recent trends, real estate growth remains really strong at 15%. Both our Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate Banking portfolios grew in the double digits, outpacing the industry.
In C&I, loan growth remains tepid and the environment remains extremely competitive. There were pockets of growth including the expansion markets, which were up 17%, and increased activity in healthcare, oil and gas, and technology sectors. With respect to pipeline, we saw the pipeline trend up or strengthen a little from the lows of last year, trending in the right direction but still relatively weak versus a year ago.
Moving on to page 10, Asset Management. The quarter saw net income of about $440 million, down 9% year on year with an ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 5% year on year, driven by flows and market performance, primarily Europe and the US, off of a very strong first quarter a year ago.
Quarter-on-quarter revenue was down 13% despite continued inflows; two-thirds of the decline was driven by normal seasonality and performance fees. The remainder of the decline related to the change in a mark-to-market of a seed investment. We did mention $100 million or so positive mark-to-market reflected in the fourth quarter's results. We gave some of that back this quarter, driving the sequential variance impact to be over $150 million.
This is the 20th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows, $20 billion for the quarter, driving record AUM of $1.6 trillion, up 11% year on year, and we've seen a strong start to April. Expense increased 11% year on year, given higher investments and cost of control, and decreased 8% quarter on quarter, largely driven by lower comp on lower revenue. Lastly in Banking, we continued to see strong loan and deposit growth with record balances up 19% and 7%, respectively.
Moving on to page 11 and Corporate and Private Equity. Private Equity net income of over $200 million included approximately $400 million of gains on investments in the quarter. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $94 million. NII remained relatively flat quarter on quarter at a negative $90 million (sic - see slide 11 "$87mm"), and we continue to expect NII in Treasury and CIO to break even by the year end, driven by higher securities yields as we benefit from higher rates. Additionally, we deployed $25 billion gross of new investments in the quarter, with the portfolio being relatively flat net of maturities, pay downs, and sales.
And before I continue, let me just tell you about NIM and NII for a second. The page is in the appendix. Total NIM was flat quarter on quarter and core NIM was up 2 basis points, primarily driven by higher investment securities yields, offset by loan spread compression.
Finally on this page, Other Corporate net income of a little over $200 million, included in this result is a $90 million after-tax impact of writing down our deferred tax assets following changes to New York State's tax which was enacted at quarter end. This upfront impact to DTA will be offset over time.
And as I said earlier, no significant legal expense to report for the quarter. It obviously feels good to have a quarter with such a small number and to have put such large issues behind us; however, I want to remind you that we still expect legal expenses to be lumpy quarter over quarter for the next couple of years as we work through remaining issues.
Now on page 12. We've covered most of the outlook as we went through the presentation, just a couple of additional things to cover. First, Mortgage Production. We told you to expect Mortgage Production to be negative for the year, we do, and we expect it to be negative for the second quarter. Obviously, the final result will be market dependent; however at this point, our outlook is for production pretax, excluding repurchase, to be a loss of between $100 million and $150 million, slightly improved from the first quarter on higher volumes seasonally.
Second, on releases. Expect mortgage reserve releases to be more modest going forward, except for potentially PCI, purchase credit impaired loans, where we could see some lumpy releases if we have any, and expect card releases to be essentially over.
So to wrap up, we feel good about the simplicity of the quarter and the solid core performance given challenging industry conditions. We are also pleased with the progress we've made on key items, including announcing the sale of our physical commodities business and our retirement planning services business, passing CCAR both qualitatively and quantitatively, exceeding 5% for the Firm and Bank leverage ratios, and maintaining strong expense discipline while investing in growth and control. And perhaps most importantly, continuing to deliver outstanding customer service and continuing to grow underlying performance drivers. With that, operator, you can open up the line please for Q&A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, Glenn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello. Maybe with avoiding too much of the details, stay at the high level and talk about no loan growth on a year on year basis. I know there's a bunch of mix in there, and I guess I'm particularly interested in the C&I bucket, because that's the one area where we do see some growth in the industry. So A, there's a little bit of verbiage in your text on how you define C&I loan growth in the Corporate bucket, and B, are there areas where you just think pricing is getting a little high and you're purposely avoiding that growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So hey, Glenn. Just so that I can give you the underlying core growth number, for the Firm for the quarter was 4% year on year, even though obviously if you take into consideration the run-off portfolios in Mortgage and Card we were closer to flat.
In C&I, you're right. The industry was up slightly. We were not. It's a continuation of the things we've talked about, which is a combination of client selection, of being very disciplined on credit, so not chasing growth at the cost of liberal credit structures or overly aggressive pricing, and also the fact that we continued to see some of our criticized and classified loans be refinanced away from us.
So we're just going to hold the line on discipline. We are seeing the ongoing aggressive competitive environment on both credit terms and pricing, and we'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do, but we're not going to chase growth at the expense of discipline.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I appreciate that. And then obviously over time we'll see that in both a steadier to up NIM and good delinquency trends I guess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so a higher quality portfolio, higher quality clients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. On the SLR that just came out you gave us the expected impacts so I appreciate that. In Jamie's annual letter I think you said quote, we began to make significant changes to the rates business and expect to maintain decent profitability. Could you talk about what you've done in rates, how much through those changes we've seen and then what to expect on the other side?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I think very broadly if you look at the numbers here we've pushed down our capital, leverage, SLR to all of the businesses so they're all making adjustments as appropriate. In the rates business in particular, you're seeing that there's very few what I call exotic rates products being done anymore, so that will be a rather large change. A lot of things going electronic, which can reduce your expenses too, so we're pretty comfortable our rates business will be normal profitability going forward. It may take a little bit of time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Glenn, I just want to make sure that it was clear in my remarks that the impact of the new proposal for leverage is included in the reported results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, very clear, and normal profitability might mean lower revenues but normal profitability, right, as things change in that business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A little bit, yes. But we all don't know what's going to happen to spreads going forward, so we're comfortable, we want to stay in the business, do a good job at it for our clients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, last one. Marianne, I guess next on the hit parade is final rules on LCR and OLA. Do you feel that's coming this year, and do you expect -- how do you feel you're positioned for that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So with LCR, whether you take the Basel or the US proposals, we're compliant at this point with the margin, and importantly we're also compliant with our own internal stress framework. So we feel good about LCR, we're continuing to manage it as you would expect.
Yes, I am expecting us to get long-term debt rules this year, but I don't know when and I can't control it; we feel with over 19% available resources that we're in a good starting position, and so we're not really going to be in the business of guessing where that ends up. And we'll adjust accordingly if it's different from our expectations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you both.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello, Erika.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, so Marianne thank you for walking us through the progress on the leverage ratio. I'm just wondering should we expect on the Bank level that you'd be compliant to 6% at some point this year, or was the quarterly progress this quarter or last quarter rather unusual?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So given that we did some restructuring of Bank level capital including some downstreaming, that was a fairly sizeable increase in the quarter, so you're not going to see progress be linear, but there are a number of different levers that we have in our toolkit so to speak to get to 6% over time, whether that's this year or whether that's into next year, we're going to be measured about the progress. So whether that's retaining earnings, potentially additional capital, we've been actioning leverage actions, both deposits as well as derivatives actions.
And then ultimately there's also the [good guide] when it comes, timing dependent that may be a 2015 thing of hopefully moving from CEM to the newly named FACCR calculations for derivatives central future exposure. We did take a look at the information on FACCR and it hasn't changed our point of view that we would expect that to have a favorable impact for the Bank of 40 basis points plus or minus. So when that comes that will be a nice boost, but through retaining earnings and the leverage actions we have and potentially more capital optimization, we have a clear path to 6%, whether it's this year or early into 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And just a second question, given you're already compliant in the LCR, is it fair for us to assume that your core margin should continue to improve throughout the year at this measured pace?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I would say it's fair to assume that our core margin should be relatively stable throughout the year, and I think plus or minus 2 basis points on a large balance sheet like ours with mix changes is relatively stable. So our expectation is for core NIM to be relatively stable in 2014, to be stable to slightly positive in 2015, assuming that the implied rate curve plays out the way it is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And just last one for me, in terms of your comments on card provision, help us think about sort of the balance in terms of the catalyst for your guidance. Should we start to expect balance growth to come back or is this more of a comment that charge-offs are as low as they will go and should normalize here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's a combination of factors and we are seeing delinquency trends and roll rate charge-offs flatten out. We knew that it would happen one day. That's what we're seeing at the moment. We'll continue to update you through the course of the year; based upon that we're not expecting anymore results. In addition, you should know that -- you saw our outstandings were flat, and underneath that our core portfolio is growing; we still do believe we are at that inflection point and that we should see some growth, but it will be relatively modest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you for taking my questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you, Erika.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If we look at the traditional bank fees even outside of mortgage, they're a bit weaker year over year than I think most might have been expecting, and I'm looking at like the card fees, service charges. Do you think that's all weather related or just weaker macro backdrop than maybe we were looking for?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So you're talking about interchange fees in Card?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just the overall credit card fee line that you give us that obviously would include the interchange, but probably some other things as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so the sales volume obviously seasonally goes down quarter over quarter. I don't think that we have perceived there's been a significant impact from weather on Card sales in the first quarter; for us our sales were up 10% year on year, so pretty strong. No, I wouldn't attribute anything to the weather.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then just separately, the expense guidance for this year I think is unchanged even though revenue's coming in a little bit weaker than expected. I realize it's just the first quarter and things could change, but is there opportunity to adjust the expense base a bit more if revenue is light?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so you saw -- obviously you saw in the first quarter that on the back of lower revenues in the markets business, we have lower compensation as an absolute matter albeit that the ratio is relatively in line.
So you're absolutely right depending upon how the rest of the year pans out will determine whether the compensation expenses inherent in our outlook for CIB are up or down or flat, and that will adjust our ending result. We're not ready yet to declare our position on the whole year, so less than $59 billion is still our guidance but we intend to be very, very disciplined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All right. And then just lastly on the buybacks, net of issuance being approved for greater than $5 billion, any comments just on the timing or the likelihood of all that being used this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so on the timing, I mentioned the fact that we aren't expecting our capital accretion to 10% plus to be linear, we're expecting it to be much more in the second half of the year, flatter in the first half, so it's reasonable to expect that we will be covering employee issuance plus or minus in the first half of the year with most of our repurchase capacity being available for us in the second half.
As to how much of it we'll use will be dependent on a number of factors including obviously our share price at the time. But we do intend to take advantage of the opportunity that we have been given to buy back, and we'll see what the absolute level is when we get there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you very much.

    Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, Marianne. In the mortgage area, the $400 million hit to the MSR risk management results, just to clarify that was a one-time hit related to your Corporate reallocation of capital that you did earlier this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's absolutely right, so when we declared at Investor Day that we had increased the target rate for that business, we pushed that down into the valuation of the asset one-time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And again, the reasons for the negative profit margin we're seeing on the origination side, is it just the timing of getting expenses adjusted to a new base originations, and it takes -- there's a lag, or is there also some investment expenses that you're running through there that are also hurting your mortgage profitability?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's three things. There's a little bit of timing in there insofar as we did make continued improvement in expenses and we're going to continue to work on what we would characterize as the sort of fixed cost base. It's definitely the case that we are building this business for the long run, and so we continue to invest in technology and operations to make us more profitable and efficient through the cycle. But it is also the case that it is an incredibly small market. I mean, the market size was sub $250 billion, so annualized sub $1 trillion, which is not something we've seen since before 2000.
So the reality is in a market that size, it's very hard to have strong profitability or profitability when you have to have a core level of fixed expenses, and so we're thinking about this business over the longer run to be as efficient and profitable as possible through the cycle in markets that are on average bigger than this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then on the markets activity in the Investment Bank, I guess a bit disappointing that activity levels didn't pick up in March where it seemed like overall rate volatility picked up as people put different takes on the Fed statements. Do you attribute some of the weakness to the lower issuance compared to last year, which seems like that could continue, and what do you think is needed to stimulate better activity, particularly in FICC this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So yes, I would say lower issuance was a factor but there were very many, so I wouldn't say that it was a single driving factor, lower mortgage issuance, lower debt issuance, a whole bunch of different things. And then as to catalysts, more volatility, more growth, and we'll just have to wait and see.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And any sense of what kind of year you're planning for there, or is it really just a wait and see how the environment unfolds and you react as it occurs?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think John we've always been very consistent on this kind of thing. You guys have got to make your own estimates because they are just as good as ours. Great business with great people, technology, sales, research, but we can't predict it going forward. It will be what it is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Similar to the mortgage comment where it's a long-term view, it affects the business and this is one quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. Any impacts on the commodities sale that's planned? Did you move that to discontinued ops or did that have any impact on the market, the metrics this quarter, Marianne?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, we've accounted for it held for sale and no significant impacts to the results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Great, thank you.

    Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hey, good morning. A couple of follow-ups. One on the commodities business that you are in the process of selling. Can you give a sense as to what the impact is likely to be post sale?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So we obviously looked at the bid and the valuation and any of the difference versus book is in our P&L and it's insignificant, and we are engaged in ongoing relationship with the buyer, and we'll realize [that over] time. But it's not expected to be anything significant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then just a couple of clarifications. On OLA you mentioned 19% available resources. I assume that's against RWA, but I just wanted to clarify.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then on SLR, on page 3, you show us the ratios. I just wanted to confirm, the Basel III line says that it's on a fully phased in basis, but we don't see fully phased in on SLR. Does that imply it's transitional?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, it's fully phased in, it's our best effort of fully phased in, Betsy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On the SLR as well right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Correct, but remember that with the exception of the fact that we aren't baking in things that are not yet certain, so we haven't baked in the benefit that we would expect, for example, from FACCR, because it hasn't yet been acknowledged.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And that 40 basis point benefit there is both for the Bank level and the Hold Co level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The sensitivity is different at the Bank and the Holding Company, so it's more like 30 plus or minus at the Holding Company, 40 plus or minus at the Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, great. Lastly on expenses you highlighted throughout all the areas where you had the headcount reduction. Could you just give us a sense as to whether or not the benefit to the expense dollars is fully in the first quarter, or was there a negative from things like severance that then the benefit to the expense dollars comes in Q2 and beyond?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the headcount reduction in the first quarter, the severance wasn't significant and the benefit is largely in. Remember we said that overall the Firm is expecting to see headcount go down by about 5,000 for the full year and it's down only by 2,000, so far so we have another way to go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the pace of that 3,000 from here is ratable or front-end loaded?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well so if you think about it gross, mortgage was 6,000 of the total gross and it's 3,000 in, so another 3,000 to go I would say in the nearer not longer term. And in the Consumer Bank that was 2,000, with 1,500 in, the remainder will just happen through time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it, thanks.

    Our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just wanted to follow-up on the FACCR. Thanks for the guidance on the potential benefit. Can you give us a sense of what specifically is driving that to be beneficial? I've gone through the BIS release, but frankly, without understanding what the underlying is, it's really difficult to understand why it's a benefit. Just maybe you can help us qualitatively understand it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I'll give you the sort of very short qualitative answer, and then if you want to really dig in, I'd do it off line with Investor Relations. But the very short answer is there's an additional ability to recognize collateral and [netting], that wasn't in the original CEM calculation, there's lots and lots of other complexity to it. We are doing our best to estimate it. We haven't fully built the models to do it, so we're continuing to work on that, but if you want to get into a very technical discussion on it we can arrange that for you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, I'll probably follow-up but that's helpful, thanks. You mentioned a number of times as you went through and we could see it in the slides that a lot of the expense impacts to the extent that expenses were problematic relative to year ago, a lot of it was because of the control agenda, which obviously we appreciated and you have spoken to.
But can we step back and talk about in a holistic Firm-wide way where are we with implementing that, how much more impact do we expect to see, at what point do we kind of lap on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, so a couple of things. First is that if you remember from Investor Day, notwithstanding the earlier comment about the volatility potentially in compensation in the Markets businesses, we said we would be below $59 billion, and there were four principal things driving that. So in our favor we have efficiencies in branches, efficiencies in CIB, and mainly mortgage down about $1.5 billion year over year. And against us we had the $1 billion incremental cost of control and some growth principally in asset management, so the net of all of those meant that we were effectively self-funding through efficiency and reduced mortgage expenses, the incremental cost and controls that you're seeing come through.
It isn't the case that we have broken out as a macro matter how much of that $1 billion is in our run rate now, and maybe we'll do that for you next quarter. I would say that we are adding heads and so these things do take some time; even though I believe that there will be a chunk of it in our run rate through the middle of the year, it's not all in our run rate yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's it, so if I could interpret that that means after midyear we should have sort of fully lapped, is that what you're saying?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well I'll have to confirm to you next quarter, but I would say that we would have a majority of it in through the midyear because we are obviously trying to hire up to be able to execute on the agenda. So if you think about the impact we're trying to add people to compliance, we are adding people to compliance, to legal, to audit, to finance, to risk, and we're doing that largely in the first half of the year, but there will be a tail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that's also really helpful. In terms of FICC and the weakness that we saw, can you comment at all and if it's possible even to quantify a little bit what the impact was of some of the adoption of SEF mandates during the quarter? We could certainly see that SEF volumes themselves seem to get disrupted at certain points in the quarter when new mandates went into play, but just if you think about the impact of that regulatory change on the OTC derivatives markets, it would be really helpful to understand how much of the impact was just regulatory change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so I mean, it's very -- as you know it's very, very difficult to decouple everything but and so it's not clear that there's no impact, but it's not our sense that it was a significant driver of the performance in the quarter, and there is a limited amount of volume on SEF right now, albeit increasing, and there's been margin compression, but from tight margins to start with. So it's not our sense that it was a significant driver, not to say that there was no impact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it did come down a little bit but it's kind of back to where it was, the derivative trading, and we wouldn't blame that for anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So if one were to think that there were going to be spread compression over time as a result of some of these things that might still lie in the future, that's to your $1 billion plus or minus revenue impact that you've talked about?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's right. So I mean again, not to say there hasn't been any but the volumes are relatively low, the margins are relatively tight, the $1 billion we talked about which is by the way our best estimate, so it could be better than that, is something that would progress through time, it's not going to be a cliff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great, that's all very helpful. I appreciate you taking my questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.

    Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys share with us on your loan loss provision this quarter, obviously last year the provision was greatly affected by loan loss reserve releases. Should we anticipate the provision reaching your net charge-off levels for this year to match them out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So the best guidance that I could give you is the guidance that we gave at Investor Day, which is expect the Firm-wide charge-offs to be at around $5 billion plus or minus, and then I would point you to the guidance we just gave you on reserve releases, which is expect some more in mortgage but modest, expect we might have some in PCI but it's too early to know, and that little more in Card, so net those two down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And there may be some noise to that, but that's our current best outlook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, speaking of the PCI loans, they're down year over year about 10% to 12%. Should we expect that type of run rate throughout the year as that portfolio continues to shrink?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, largely speaking. That seems about right, 10%, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. You talked about in the mortgage business you're changing the way you're approaching it, and the revenue run rate you had this quarter of about $160 million, can you size for us where you think kind of the new approach that you're having with mortgages, what kind of revenues we might anticipate? Because I'm assuming this was unusually low, this quarter's number?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So our production revenues this quarter, just to make sure we're talking about the same thing, was just about $300 million. I told you that we're expecting the second quarter to be negative, you're going to have higher revenues because seasonally you have higher volumes, but obviously it's market dependent.
So I would say given seasonality, the first quarter was small and volumes were depressed given the weather, we would be hopeful that the market would be above $1 trillion for the full year, maybe not quite as high as $1.2 trillion, so if you add seasonality back in and gross up the number, you could probably get quite close. But of course it could all change depending upon rates in the market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great and then --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The current outlook for the market size was about $1.2 trillion. I suspect that will be revised down slightly on the back of the first quarter, so we're going to have a small market. It won't be absolutely linear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. In the institutional asset management business, you pointed out the decline sequentially in the revenues because of some of the one-time items in the fourth quarter. On the year-over-year declines, even though the inflows were up, any comments on the revenues for the institutional revenue part of that business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Year-over-year revenues for asset management, institutional, no specific. We had some -- March was not strong, the first quarter for institutional was not as strong as the other segments, so no specific issues but there's some lumpiness there obviously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, And then finally, it may just be market conditions or maybe something you can do, when you look at your net interest margin and you look at the interest earning asset yields, the securities borrowed number was a negative 30 basis points, it's been trending more negative each quarter. It was minus 2 basis points a year ago. Can you point to anything you could do to try to reverse that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, the securities, that line item is a funky feature of the fact that in our prime services business, when we -- our contractual income is LIBOR minus the spread which drives that to be a negative number; I wouldn't read too much into the trend and volatility there. The absolute economics of the business is still positive and the offset is in trading liability, so that's not a line item in its own right and alone that is very constructive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [100]

    Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks. I had a few questions. You had no significant items that you called to our attention, but then you said there were a few sort of non-core items and they broadly offset. And just as I'm looking at my notes I see there's like a $400 million negative in MSR, there's a $90 million in tax, there's $200 million of DVA/FVA, all negative, and then there's $400 million of private equity gains, but I guess I'm missing another sort of $300 million of positive. I just was wondering if you could kind of call out what that would be?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Reserve releases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Oh, okay, the reserve releases. All right, understood.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then we don't drill into every $50 million negative non-recurring item but there was some of them too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that's fine. And then just on the tax rate, obviously I'd strip out the $90 million but it still feels like a high tax rate. Is there anything funny going on there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, it's not far off the 30% plus or minus, which is our generally expected effective tax rate. Nothing else of any noteworthiness. I mean obviously it's always going to be impacted by the absolute level of pretax, the percentage of overseas income, the percentage of tax efficient income, but nothing special.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then the guidance on Mortgage Production that sort of pushed out the losses and we've talked about it a lot, but just so I'm clear the change in your guidance there is just essentially a change in your market expectations, the $1.2 trillion coming to a lower number, that's the only real change you've got there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We haven't really changed our guidance, to be fair our guidance was always to be negative for the year. We're just trying to be very specific about the degree of negative in the second quarter to make sure you have information for your models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Perfect, and we appreciate that. That's all for me, thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, thank you very much. You guys mentioned I believe in a report or in comments that you want to get your servicing portfolio down from $800 billion to $600 billion on loans there, I guess just natural decay and selling MSRs. When do you think the timing of those sales of the MSRs, and do you think that -- a lot of people feel that you cannot transfer any MSRs anymore due to some of the headline risk. Can you add some color to that also?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So obviously the timing of sales is going to be a little bit opportunistic, so the best comment I can make is that $600 million number is two, three years away from now, not necessarily but we'll try and manage it the best way we can.
And then with respect to the ability to sell sub service, there is still the opportunity to do it. It's just not necessarily the case that you can defease your risk entirely, which I think is understood.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you add more color, you can't get rid of the risk? Can you add more color around that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well I mean, insofar as I think that as we move loans to sub services, obviously we retain the risks and have to have third-party oversight. To the degree we sell them, I think the regulators are potentially looking at originators to continue to bear some of the origination and other risks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're going to run the MSR for returns and quality, so it's also a question of what you put into it so you should probably expect to see less FHA and things like that, and then you'll see some run-off over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then Jamie, on the credit boxes not really expanding, what do you think, what kind of impact do you think that's having on the overall mortgage market, especially the purchase market, as we're seeing almost 14 year lows on the origination side?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's almost impossible to tell, but there are -- if you're jumbo you can get loans, if you are GSE you can get loans, but almost all the other stuff in between, anything with any hair on it like if you ever had a credit problem, if you are earning self-reported income, so a lot of people have overlay, they're being tougher than is required by FHA, GSE, or their own rules because of reps and warranties, et cetera.
And I don't know when that's going to go away. It's not getting worse. It's just sitting there and probably holding back a little bit the purchase market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Think about the credit is available across the LTV spectrum, but the bar to be able to document income and prove ability to repay under QM is high.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [121]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, guys, thank you very much.

    Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura - Analyst    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura - Analyst    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You had alluded to some of the drivers of the RWA growth earlier, and I was just hoping you could frame that in the context of your $40 billion targeted RWA decline from Investor Day, and whether that's potentially at risk or is the $1.55 trillion RWA level still achievable?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So the models that were disapproved we understood that we were going to have certain of our models that needed additional work to be acceptable by the regulators of Basel III when we gave the guidance at Investor Day, so as a large matter as we sit here today, that's still our best understanding of how things will work out absent there being any new news or issues during the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's a timing difference as opposed to a target difference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, the whole industry submitted a huge number of models under Basel 2.5 to the regulators to review at the beginning of 2013. We had an approval to use them for the year while they were being reviewed and pending after the review; we got some feedback and we're going to remediate the models and resubmit them for approval. So it will take us time but it is timing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura - Analyst    [129]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, understood. And then transitioning to OLA for a second. Long-term debt outstanding did increase modestly about 2% in the quarter. I just wanted to confirm how we should be thinking about issuance plans over the course of the year. Are you managing it to a 19% bail in buffer, so we saw the modest increase in RWA and then saw a commensurate increase in long-term debt, or should we be thinking about it entirely differently?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just assume it's going to be fairly constant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura - Analyst    [131]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [132]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When we know what the real rules are we may modify that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [133]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's right. We're not managing to an OLA that we don't know yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura - Analyst    [134]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, fair enough. And then last one for me. The high frequency trading review and potential market structure overhaul continues to be an area of increasing focus, and I was hoping you could speak to the equities business and whether the anticipated SEC review and potential broader equity market structure reform will compel any adjustments? And how you're thinking about that at this juncture?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well we told you we are firmly supportive of having proper and good markets for everybody, and we think we have pretty good policies and protocols in place. But I don't know what it will do to other -- there are issues in market structures with some pools et cetera, but we just have to let that review take place. I should point out in Michael Lewis' book which I did not read on page 231, they refer to us as one of the good guys.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura - Analyst    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, fair enough. Thank you for taking my questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [137]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.

    Our next question comes from Jeff Harte of Sandler O'Neill.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Harte,  Sandler O'Neill & Partners - Analyst    [139]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi good morning. A couple left for me. One, looking at Consumer and Business Banking such that it is a deposits business, the overhead and the efficiency ratio there has really trended up for a few years straight. I know there's been some investment as well, but how should we think of that going from kind of the 70% plus it's been now back to some kind of the mid 60 like it historically was?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [140]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So a couple of things. As you know, we have been investing and building our branch to the place it is now where we're happy with the distribution capability we have, so that was driving a lot of the investment. In 2014 we continue to invest in [quarterly] and digital and the cost to serve and efficiency so that we can drive the ratios down.
We guided at Investor Day to expect expenses in the business to be up 1%, so a little but not the kind of increase that we've been seeing after which you should expect it to start to come down. And we said that the overall CCB business including mortgage would be down $2 billion by 2016 over 2014, and a chunk of that is in CBD.
So we are very focused on it and investing in fact in the technology and processes to be able to be efficient; we started to see the increased turn as we stopped having to invest in branches because we're happy with the distribution and it will start to come down next year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Harte,  Sandler O'Neill & Partners - Analyst    [141]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So that is getting better to some extent as expenses going down, to what extent is revenues getting better? Does the WaMu footprint factor into that, or are we waiting for interest rate help?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [142]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So everything that I talked about in terms of expenses going down is all on a dollar basis, not an efficiency ratio basis, so we're absolutely expecting dollars to come down after 2014 in the business.
With respect to the new branches, I mean we said like there's a third of our branches that are less than 10 years old, and about 11% less than 3 years old, so we have a lot of branches in the deposit gathering phase. And deposit margins are relatively flat, so at the moment we've reached the point where volume is out, is providing support to NII, but not strong growth until we start to see rates continue to rise and be able to reinvest up the curve as deposits investments mature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The underlying numbers are terrific, customer satisfaction, deposits, households, mobile, Chase Wealth Management, small business, et cetera, but they are being squeezed by NII and interest rates and we've always told you we're going to build for the long run, which is that will recover one day and you will see spreads go up in this business. And when that happens it happens, but we're not going to not grow deposits because of that. And that will also affect obviously efficiency ratio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Harte,  Sandler O'Neill & Partners - Analyst    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And on the litigation side, nice to have a quarter where there aren't big charges, who knows what the market does, but in theory that's a good thing for the share price. Is there the potential for that to be a good thing for the underlying businesses too? Have all the headline risks been a negative on some of the business lines from a consumer customer perspective?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so as much as I would love to be able to take a quarter that looks like this and say we could expect more of the same, the reality is we still have issues open in front of us. We still have large reserves and we still are working through them. So we've been clear that while we can't predict legal expenses, we do expect them to be lumpy, and for every zero or close to zero quarter, we could have a quarter that has several hundred millions of dollars or more, albeit that it should trend down and abate to something much lower over time.
So I don't think you can read into it that we're done, we're still working through issues, we're obviously glad to have some of them behind us and some of the bigger and most difficult ones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Harte,  Sandler O'Neill & Partners - Analyst    [146]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To the extent you're not looking hopefully at multi billion dollar quarterly settlements anymore, does that help on the volume side of the businesses? Did that have a negative impact on kind of customer interactions with you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [147]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. If you look at the customer flows, in every single business they are very good, and customer sat scores are up, investments are up, assets under management are up, market shares are up, credit card, consumer, deposits, that's all very good. So I would completely separate out this litigation stuff, and Marianne, you all have averaged your own estimates for litigation I think are $500 million a quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By our quarterly models, it's about $500 million a quarter, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So make believe, I'm going to use your number, nobody else's, it's not going to be $500 million consistent. It's going to be zero, something else, zero to $50 million, that's what it is until it goes away. It's not going to affect the underlying business. And as you know we're also going to have one-time benefits from stuff we don't anticipate too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Harte,  Sandler O'Neill & Partners - Analyst    [150]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So you haven't noticed kind of a negative reputational impact with customers? It's been okay obviously, looking at the volumes I guess it must be okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [151]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're growing share so--

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [152]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Clients go with their feet and they seem to be coming to our branches and our bankers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Harte,  Sandler O'Neill & Partners - Analyst    [153]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [156]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, good morning. Two follow-ups. First on the expense side, I think if you look at the run rate this quarter you had around $58.4 billion, and so well below; if you analyze that then your $59 billion target and seasonally this would be the higher expense quarter given capital markets revenue. Is there something we should be thinking about in the out quarters, whether it's higher regulatory compliance spending, marketing spending, or is this just some conservative because we don't know where capital markets revenues go?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [157]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's a little bit of we don't know where capital markets revenues will go obviously, and if they stay low or we expect to pass that down to the bottom line, it's also a little bit of there are sometimes positive and sometimes negative surprises and issues in expenses at this time every quarter, so there's a little bit of cautiousness in there. We're going to obviously do everything we can to outperform that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, fair enough. And maybe a quick question back on the SLR. You guys I think last quarter before the changes by Basel noted that the Basel committee's calculation would be a net drag of 10 basis points, this quarter it's 15 to 20 basis points benefit, right? Is that simply the changing in the credit conversion factors on the off-balance sheet credit lines, or is there anything else driving that improvement this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [159]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So most of the improvement in this quarter was associated with the ability for us to net variation margin on derivatives across currencies as allowed by contracts rather than having to only net in the currency of the underlying transaction. So that was obviously sensible that you should be allowed to net margin across allowable currencies, but that was not the provision of the Basel committee; the US proposal changed that and that's favorable. That's driving most of it, there were other things up, down, complicated technical things, but not big numbers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [160]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And that doesn't include the benefit of moving to say the non-internal model methodology, which would be another 40 basis points?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [161]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's correct but I'm not expecting that in the very near future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [162]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. Okay, great thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [164]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, good morning. As you mentioned I'm looking at page 17 of your supplement on the credit card business, and as you mentioned all the volume metrics all look great. Sales volume up 10% and merchant processing up 11%, but then when you look at the fees, it's down 4%. And I would have thought we kind of anniversaried all of the regulatory changes and so on, so I guess a big question for me is in this business in particular, why aren't the favorable volume metrics translating into revenues?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [165]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're going to have to get back to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [166]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Chris I'll get back to you. I apologize. We'll get back to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Probably has to do with [awards], but we'll get back to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then just secondly on the broader philosophical level, Jamie, a couple years ago at Investor Day, you rhetorically asked a question about capital markets income, is it cyclical or is it secular, and you said believe me it's cyclical.
And now, you look industry wide by my numbers, we're down on a year-over-year basis 13 out of the last 17 quarters, and it's sure as heck feeling secular. And I'm curious, one, have you adjusted your point of view? Two, do you think there is some irreducible level of transaction volume business for the industry? And three, how do we gauge how far we are on that glide path from where we used to be to where we stabilize?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [169]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So there are certain things which are secular. People who have gotten out of it -- I'm not talking about us per se, but people have gotten out of reduced dramatically credit hybrids, certain exotic derivatives et cetera, and I think there may be additional secular change. But it's not the whole business, so the way I look at the whole business is we have 120 trading desks around the world, we have 16,000 clients.
And if you look at the fuel of the business, the fuel of the business is investable assets in need of people to invest those, whether it's corporations, individual, et cetera. Those numbers will double over 10 years, they're going to triple in the emerging and developing markets. And spreads themselves have been coming down fairly consistently for 20 years, and that's called capitalism, that you're efficiently using capital.
So I look at it as a long-term business, it will be a good business, shares are going to change, there will be a whole bunch of adjustments. And as you know, it can change on a dime, and so we're not, I don't look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup. I think it's pretty good business, and we have had very consistent performance. Remember it's driven by technology, research, sales, ideas, of course border flows, and last year we didn't even have one trading day loss, which I consider really spectacular.
So it's a good business. It will grow over time and it will have some secular adjustments. And I don't know about your numbers being right, the 13 of 17 quarters. And I also wouldn't go back and look at the peak, the really peak markets of 2007 or something and I think you had some of that in 2009 and say that was a standard. I think that was a little high. Higher than normal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [170]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well my numbers were industry from 2009 on, or 2010 on, so but anyway, but thanks. It's probably an unanswerable question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [171]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I have an answer to your other question, I apologize for not having it off the top of my head. In the first quarter of last year, in non-interest revenue in Card we had a one-time exit of a non-core product. So I think if you go back and dig out that transcript or have a look at the supplement there, there was actually a one-time item, so if we adjust for that, we would have been up more strongly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [172]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [173]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I might mention on the credit card business we have beta tests going of our Chase net and you're not going to see it in the numbers this year, but we think it's a pretty exciting thing that we can do for merchants and customers over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [174]

    We have no further questions at this time.
