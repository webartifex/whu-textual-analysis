Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first-quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. 
So if you turn to page 1, a very strong start to the year with record net income of $6.5 billion for the first quarter and record EPS of $1.59 a share. On revenue of $25.8 billion, and a return on tangible common equity of 17% for the quarter. You can see on page 1 we've highlighted up front two significant items. A $650 million reserve release in mortgage and a $500 million reserve release in card. And as I go through the presentation, I'll also be highlighting for you a number of smaller items, some positive and some negative. 
We continue to maintain the leadership positions we highlighted at Investor Day. Number one ATM network. Number two branch network. Number two mortgage originator. Number one credit card issuer in the US. And number one ranking in global IB fees. And we're on track to deliver against our expense targets for the year. 
On a reported basis, total loans for the Company were up 1%, with core loan growth, excluding run-off, up 5%. Favorable credit performance continued in our wholesale and core consumer portfolios, with low levels of delinquencies and charge-offs. As the housing market recovers, losses in the real estate portfolio continue to improve. And this quarter we saw 30 plus delinquencies decline by 14% and severities improve. 
If you turn to page 3 for a brief capital update. We ended the quarter with Basel I and Basel III Tier One common of $143 billion, and $146 billion, respectively. Both up from last quarter. Our Basel I ratio is 10.2%, which reflects the impact of new market risk rules that went into effect in January. And the 10.2% compares to a ratio of 9.9% for last quarter as measured on the same basis. Our Basel III ratio of 8.9% is up from 8.7% last quarter and reflects the full impact of the rules as we understand them. And, as you know, we don't pull forward the impact of passive run-off or [mode] enhancements, which we expect to deliver around 100 basis points of benefit this year and next. And we still expect to reach our Basel III Tier 1 common target of 9.5% by the end of this year, including the capacity to continue share repurchases. 
As we've also made progress this quarter and are on track for full LCR compliance this year. In the bullet at the bottom of the page, the Board intends to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share effective in the second quarter. And we repurchased $2.6 billion of common equity in the first quarter, with authorization to repurchase an additional $6 billion over the next four quarters. 
Turning to the businesses. On page 4 we have Consumer- Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.6 billion of revenue. With an ROE of 23% on new allocated capital. And as we go through the presentation, all of the current quarter ROEs are calculated based upon the new allocated capital numbers that we showed you at Investor Day. Overall, revenue was down year on year and quarter on quarter, driven by Mortgage Banking. Quarter on quarter, the reduction reflects the continuation of production margin compression. Credit costs reflect the releases in both Mortgage Banking and Cards that we referred to on page 1. And core expenses were flattish both year over year and quarter over quarter, normalizing prior periods. 
We remain on track to deliver on our expense guidance. And headcount in the Consumer Bank and Mortgage business was down over 3,000 heads this quarter, a function of the evolution in the branch operating model and the completion of the IFR work. We ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches and close to 19,000 ATMs. And as of today we have over 1,400 Chase private client locations. 
On page 5, Consumer- Business Banking. Net income of $641 million, and an ROE of 24%, on net revenue of $4.2 billion, down 2% year on year and quarter on quarter. The sequential decline is due to fewer days in the quarter for net interest income and seasonality in non-interest revenue. We continue to see pressure on deposit margins. 8 basis points down in the quarter and 32 basis points year over year. But this continues to be largely offset by deposit growth of 11% year over year, which we believe is significantly faster than the industry. And this quarter we had the lowest customer attrition on record, which reflects the great progress that we're making on the customer experience. 
And we were just named winner of four TNS Choice Awards, recognizing superior performance in customer acquisitions, retention, satisfaction and market share with consumer and affluent banking customers, which is more than any financial institution has earned in any year. Average Business Banking loan balances of $18.7 billion are flattish quarter over quarter. And in the drivers you can see loan production decreased this quarter due to softer demand and higher competitive intensity. However, the pipeline in the second quarter is looking stronger. 
We had record investment sales of over $9 billion, up 40% year on year. And client investment assets up 15%. Which shows that we're penetrating our customers more deeply, with 70% of those sales, up from 50% last year, being managed money, driving strong recurring revenues. Finally on this page, expenses are up year over year, reflecting the investments we are making in the business, including new branch builds and one-time costs related to a contract renegotiation. 
Turning to page 6 and Mortgage Banking. Overall net income of $673 million, and an ROE of 14%. If you look at the top of the table in the first blue highlighted item, production pretax income was $427 million, down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by continued margin compression. As we expected and as we talked about last quarter, gain on sale margins continued to come down this quarter, and reached levels of around 100 basis points on a pretax basis. Which compares to a normalized pretax margin in the fourth quarter of last year of around 180 basis points. And was driven by a significant tightening in primary and secondary spreads, as well as pricing pressure, reflecting increased capacity in the market. 
Strong originations of $53 billion were up 37% year on year and 3% sequentially. While applications were actually down 8% from last quarter. But we continue to expect high levels of refinancing and close loan volumes in the next quarter to remain solid. Production expense increased year on year on higher volumes, and net repurchases of $81 million in the quarter, reflects a reduction in realized losses, partially offset by reserve releases. We continue to believe we're adequately reserved and we do expect reserve releases to broadly offset losses over time. 
Moving down to Servicing. Revenue of $778 million increased sequentially, primarily due to one-time gains associated with buying, curing and reselling certain delinquent loans out of securities. Servicing expenses of $737 million included a small amount of final IFR costs as we wound down the work this quarter, and also some severance. And if you back those costs out, Servicing expenses were slightly lower than the $725 million normalized run rate we talked about last quarter. IFR costs are now out of our run rate. And we continue to expect Servicing costs to reduce to $600 million by the fourth quarter of this year. 
MSR risk management was a modest loss, $142 million. The driver of the net loss is an increase in our expectations for home price appreciation this year, which is a great thing but drove an approximate negative $400 million within the model update line in the supplement given higher prepayments. And, although there's an upfront negative in the mark of the Servicing assets, improvements in home prices will drive lower credit losses over time that will more than outweigh this mark. 
Finally on this page, real estate portfolios showed pretax income of $784 million, which includes net charge-offs of around $450 million this quarter, and compared to a normalized fourth-quarter number of $520 million. This reflects lower delinquencies, as well as lower severities as home prices improve, and net to release reserves of $650 million this quarter. As you've seen, charge-offs have been steadily declining, and we do expect that to continue but at a more moderated pace. And we've updated our guidance for you to expect quarterly net charge-offs to be at or below $400 million. 
If you turn to page 7, Cards, Merchant Services and Auto. Net income of $1.3 billion, up 8% year on year, or up 33% if you exclude the change in loan loss reserves and ROE of 33%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was flat year on year, but down quarter on quarter with quarter one having seasonally lower loan balances, sales volumes and merchant processing volumes. Expenses were down both year over year and quarter on quarter, primarily driven by non-core expense items in the comparable period. 
Net charge-offs continue to be low. And we released $500 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting the continued improvement in early stage roll rates. The net charge-off rate of 3.55%, while down over 80 basis points year over year, was up slightly quarter on quarter on lower loan balances. And consistent with Investor Day, you should expect up to $1 billion of Card reserve releases in the full year of 2013, including the $500 million reflected this quarter. Year-on-year growth in sales volume was strong at 9%. And the revenue rate of 12.83% reflects strong interchange revenue and merchant processing fees, with merchant processing volumes up 15% year on year. 
And moving on to Auto, originations were up 12% year on year, and 18% quarter on quarter. And although the first quarter is seasonally stronger, this growth outpaced the normal seasonal pattern. We gained share in the quarter through improved competitive positioning in prime. And also saw strong growth with our private-label manufacturing partners. 
Moving on to slides 8 and 9 and the Corporate- Investment Bank. Very strong first-quarter results. And the results this quarter included a small DVA gain of $126 million, versus a loss in the same quarter of last year of $900 million. Both of which you'll see in the credit adjustments line item in the tables. So, if we focus on the numbers, excluding DDA, $2.5 billion of net income on $10 billion of revenue, down 2% year on year but up 22% quarter on quarter and with an ROE of 18%. Total banking revenue of $3 billion, up 12% year on year, driven by higher IB fees of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% year on year with record bond underwriting. And lending-related revenue of $500 million, primarily core NII and fees on retained loans and commitments. And to a lesser extent gains on positions of fees in loan restructuring. 
Total markets and investor services revenue of $7 billion, down 7% year on year, driven by fixed income markets of $4.8 billion. Down 5% year on year, coming off of a very strong first quarter last year. And up 50% quarter on quarter on seasonality, with continued strength in the client franchise. The P&L impact from the remaining synthetic credit portfolio included here was insignificant this quarter but positive. 
Equity markets of $1.3 billion, down 6% year on year, but up 50% quarter on quarter. And the sequential change reflects seasonally strong equity derivatives results. Security services revenues of $974 million were flat year on year and down slightly quarter on quarter. And while a portion of this reflects the depository of receipts business, which is seasonally down, the portion that reflects our custody business has grown in line with assets under custody, which were $19.3 trillion, up 8% year on year. And we're seeing positive expense trends. Year on year, a net reduction of 2%, driven by lower compensation and efficiency initiatives, substantially offset this quarter by litigation expenses. If you take the DVA and the restructuring gains I mentioned, as well as the litigation expense, they net out. 
The comp to revenue ratio ex DVA of 34% is in line with our guidance. And at the bottom of the driver section, you can see that our average CIB VAR continues to decline this quarter to $62 million, reflecting lower levels of risk including the continued derisking of the synthetic credit portfolio. But also reflecting very low levels of volatility across multiples assets classes. 
On page 9, before I skip over this page, you can see that we continue to make progress growing our international loans and deposits. Our international loan balances were up 9% since the end of 2012, with particular strength across Asia and EMEA. 
Moving on to page 10 and the Commercial Bank. This quarter saw net income of nearly $600 million, on $1.7 billion of revenue, flat year over year with a return on equity of 18%. Underlying loan growth of 11% year on year includes our C&I portfolio, which grew 12%, in line with the industry. And our commercial real estate book, which grew 10% year over year, significantly above the industry, driven by commercial term lending. Quarter over quarter, loan balances were generally flat, consistent with the industry, partly reflecting the fact that some demand was pulled forward into the fourth quarter. But also reflecting lower levels of demand and increased competition. Loan spreads held up well this quarter and remained stable to last quarter. And credit quality continued to be very strong. Lastly here, expenses up 8% year on year on the continued investment in the business, and increased operating expenses for Commercial Card. 
Turning to page 11. Our Asset Management business had record net income for a first quarter of $487 million, up 26% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter, with an ROE of 22%. 12% year-on-year revenue growth reflects an increase in management fees, driven by strong long-term net inflows, including a record $31 billion this quarter, marking the 16th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows. We also had higher equity and fixed income markets, up 9% based on our business mix. And saw higher performance fees driven by strong fund returns in 2012. 
We had record loan balances, up over $20 billion, driven by increases in US mortgage and international loan growth. Total AUM was close to $1.5 trillion, with over $1 trillion in long-term AUM. And lastly, higher headcount expenses and performance-related comps contributed to a 9% year-over-year expense growth. But the pretax margin of 29% also increased from 26% last year, reflecting an improvement in operating leverage. 
Moving on to page 12, Corporate and Private Equity. Total net income of $250 million for the quarter, and reflected a Private Equity net loss of $182 million, including nearly $300 million of unrealized losses related to specific positions. Treasury and CIO net income was $24 million. And included about $500 million of net securities gains, offset by about $470 million of negative NII due to low rates and limited reinvestment opportunities. Both the private equity losses and the securities gains were more significant this quarter than usual, and netted to positive $200 million pretax. Finally, other corporate net income of just over $400 million includes $230 million of prior period tax adjustments. And finishing on guidance, in CIO Treasury our guidance remains a net loss of $300 million plus or minus. And in other corporate, our guidance remains $100 million, plus or minus of net income. With both numbers able to vary quarter over quarter. 
Turning to page 13 and net interest margin, firm-wide NIM declined 3 basis points and core NIM 2 basis points quarter on quarter. A number of items affected our NIM. First, to the negative. The low rate environment continues to affect our reinvestment opportunities. And also competitive pressures continue to impact loan yields. On the positive side, investment securities yields increased from higher mortgage-backed securities income, driven by slower prepayments and reduced secured financing. And lower long-term debt costs reflected a change in mix. 
Lastly, our outlook on page 14. We've covered most of these items already. But you'll see that we've changed our NIM and NII guidance to put it all together in one place and on a consistent basis. All numbers shown are pretax and are estimates of net NII, reflecting both rate compression and volume growth. So you should expect modest NIM compression during the year with absolute levels of NII very strongly supported by growth in interest-earning assets. While overall NII expected to be down about 1% this year. Lastly, you may have seen we will redeem about $5 billion of outstanding trust preferreds in the second quarter. And as a heads up, this will lead to a modest one-time loss in the second quarter, but also a lower cost of debt over time. 
Wrapping up, we had a record quarter with high-quality earnings and strong underlying business performance, seeing positive momentum across our businesses. Thank you for joining us. Operator, you can open up the call for Q&A.

John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, Marianne. On the last point about NII outlook, what are the drivers of the strong growth(technical difficulty)? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    John, we can't hear you. Apologies, John, we didn't hear the question. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you hear me? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, we can. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sorry about that. Can you tell me on the NII outlook, what are the drivers of the strong growth in earning assets you expect that you just mentioned on the NII page? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're growing, as you've probably seen, we showed you on Investor Day. And while there was a little bit of lower growth this quarter, we do expect to grow loans in our commercial bank loans in Asset Management, wholesale loans, Mortgage Banking. And we're growing our deposits very strongly. So it's really just the underlying business driver growth that we've been seeing and expect to continue. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And on the expense outlook, you mentioned for the adjusted expenses to be down about $1 billion. What's the base that we should look at for you to be down from? Do you have that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. John, actually, if I refer you back -- and from recollection, I'll do it for you -- but if I refer you back to Investor Day, it's based upon our adjusted expenses, which are defined as our expenses excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters. Which in 2012 was $60 billion, plus or minus. I think $60.1 billion. And we're expecting to be $59 billion this year. And that's what we're on track to deliver. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And what was it in the first quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A little higher than that in the first quarter. But the first quarter is seasonally high. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, got it. And then can you repeat your outlook on the default servicing expense line? That came down a lot this quarter nicely and you mentioned the target for the end of the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. The fourth-quarter normalized run rate was $725 million. This quarter it's down a little off that, as you would expect, given the IFR completion. We said that we expected the fourth quarter to be running at $600 million. And we said that at Investor Day and we're still on track to do that. And we've also said that the long-term run rate for that part of the business would be about $325 million a quarter, and that would be over the next couple of years. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then the litigation dropped significantly this quarter. I think you said it was immaterial this quarter on the litigation provision. Is that right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The litigation dropped quarter over quarter. Clearly we had a large number last quarter on the back of IFR. And we did have litigation expense this quarter, you'll see in the supplementary there, just over $300 million. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And the last thing is on the buybacks. You did a healthy buyback this quarter but the share count didn't shrink that much. Is the first quarter heavier than usual in terms of your issuance? And the question's getting at, would $2.6 billion of buybacks in other quarters be expected to shrink the share count in quarters when it's not the first quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, that's right, John. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So your issuance is more weighted towards the first? Is that right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, but also remember, we didn't buy back shares in the fourth quarter or the third quarter. So there was an overall net $2.6 billion  gross] $2,6 billion net of employee issuance. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'm just getting at how that translates to reduction in the share count. It's offset by what you do issuance, right? -- each quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Was this a normal quarter of issuance? So a $2.6 billion buyback keeps the share count flat? Is that the kind of ratio we might expect? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. I think the issuance number is fairly level and consistent quarter by quarter, because it's really based upon amortization of restricted stock and all that. And the buyback, the $2.6 billion, remember, that was over the course of the quarter, so it averaged out to 50% of that for the quarter. So we can give you more detail a little bit later. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, we'll come back to you John. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. But it was steady throughout the year. That's what I was getting at. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But the $6 billion will offset how much average amortization over the same 12-month period, like $2 billion. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, $2 billion. John, that's a good way of looking at it. The $6 billion we're authorized to repurchase relates to employee issuance over the same period of just a little bit over $2 billion. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For accounting purposes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    $2 billion for the year, and $6 billion for the year. Okay, great. Thank you.

    Glenn Schorr of Nomura. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First one. The first deadline for compliance with Central Clearing came and went, and it clearly didn't have much of an impact on your first-quarter FICC results. So I'm curious, I hear commentary in the market that a lot of clients might not be ready for either the second or the third deadlines later this year. Curious what you're expecting and if you do think it could produce any hiccup in activity levels. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The second one is the big one, that's June 11, or something like that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, June 11. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And that's where you have a lot of bigger client stuff like that. People are still getting used to it. So we think -- I think we've got 30% or 40% lined up to do it. They're still reading documents, have to sign new documents. So hopefully it will go smoothly. It's unlikely to go smoothly the first round. The first round were really large participants and swap deals, et cetera. We'll have to just wait and see. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And even on the wait and see, if some aren't ready, do you think of that as a temporary and just literally a function of processing, not -- maybe we don't need insurance anymore because it's too expensive? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Look, we really don't know. I would say temporary but probably still down a little bit because of the reason you gave. Some feel and just say -- we don't need to do this anymore. And we also know all the final rules, by the way, and how the SCFs are going to work in bidding. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. Okay. Marianne, on the RWA front, a bunch of little things in here. But Basel I RWAs were up 11% quarter on quarter but Basel III were pretty much flat. I know that has something to do with 2.5 starting in the first quarter. But if you can help us. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. If you take -- our Basel I RWA went up about $200 million. That's all about the implementation of the new market risk rules in Basel 2.5. Which is also why you saw our ratio go down from a reported 11% last quarter. It's really all explained by that. And our Basel III RWA was flattish quarter over quarter, with some pluses and some minuses. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That was already in there essentially. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Of course, yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So that leads into the comment you made towards the beginning on any passive runoff and model enhancements are not pulled forward in your results. And I think you said it could be about 100 basis points. Is there a dollar amount of RWA natural runoff that we should be thinking about? Because obviously capital's building. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    My recollection -- and, again, Glenn, forgive me if I get this wrong -- it's on the slide from the firm overview and Investor Day -- but I think that 100 basis points equates to about $180 billion of RWA over the next two years. But, remember, the passive runoff will take place over time. Not completely linearly but over time. And the model enhancements can be a little bit lumpier and a little bit more back ended. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. But, yes, we're still expecting for those things to happen, for us to get 100 basis points of benefit from that, and that's without the active mitigation. That's going to happen over the course of time. Just check that slide for me, Glenn, when you get on. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Will do. Last one, Jamie. I know you addressed some of this in your shareholder letter. But between everything related to Basel III -- stress test, Dodd-Frank -- in place already, and then OLA and living wills coming online, it feels like we're going down the path on containing too big to fail. But yet there's a steady drum beat, including Brown-Vitter, to change things. Just curious on where we're headed in this and what will stop the drum beat. When is enough enough? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Glenn, I actually think you all on the line should be dealing with this issue a little bit because the reason you have companies is because they serve clients well at a good cost. There's a reason our numbers are good, because we have cross sell and clients come to us. And there are reasons for global banks, just like there are reasons for community banks. I think the real issue -- again, you guys do the numbers -- is the banking system has gotten so much stronger in the United States. And it's not just capital, but it's capital, liquidity, oversight. Activities that people like are no longer being done. Derivatives are going to clearing houses. And the initial wave of OLA and living wills, et cetera, those things should all work. I hope at one point we declare a victory and just stop eating our young at this thing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Couple of follow-ups on RWA. How much of the passive mitigation was embedded within the RWA results for Basel III this quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Betsy, there was a little bit of passive mitigation. There was a little bit of run-off. And there was also some declines as we purchased back some AFS securities, and those were offset by some other things. It wasn't a very big number because, as I say, that will bleed in over time. And the model enhancements which are about 50% of the 100-basis-point benefit will be a bit back ended. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So, really, that's going to come later this year, is what you're saying? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's right. Yes, some of it later this year, some of it next. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then on the NIM and the LCR, there's obviously an interplay there. And could you just give us an update on where you are with the LCR this quarter? Because your NIM decline this quarter actually was a lot lighter than what we were expecting. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. We showed you at Investor Day that we had a gap to be fully compliant. We're going to be fully compliant by the end of the year. We did close that gap this quarter, not completely, by about one-third. Obviously we also disclosed -- on the slide you'll see our HQLA, our high quality liquid assets which has a relationship. They've gone up. But that's the numerator and the denominator changes, too. So think about it as we've made good progress. We've closed the gap by about one-third and we're on the way to compliance. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And I think, when Marianne gave you the forecast going forward for NIM, that includes changing how we create more LCR. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. Okay. And then lastly, just on the CCAR conditional approval, can you just give us a sense? Because I think people were a little bit surprised to see that you had the conditional approval results and yet you were able to do the buyback and the dividend hike that you asked for. So the underlying question is, what can you speak to with regard to what's being asked? And what kind of time frame do you think you have for satisfying the regulatory requirements here? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On the quantitative stuff we passed. And that's why we got the capital plan. There are criticisms around qualitative. And from what we know now, and we're still doing work, we're going to give you more, is around -- they want more granular type of forecasting. They want more idiosyncratic type of forecasting. So we're having conversations with them. Marianne has formed a CCAR department which is going to become experts in CCAR. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And, Betsy, in terms of the time line, we're resubmitting, as requested, in the third quarter. We're doing everything between now and then to remediate and improve our processes following their feedback. So we're committed to being successful. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Thanks.

Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just a follow-up on the question on litigation. That dropped to the $0.3 billion. Is that potentially -- are we now adjusting to a lower level? Or was that just noise in what is an extremely volatile number bouncing around a little? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so Brennan, I think it's very hard to predict. And you're right, it bounces around and it can be noisy. We had a higher level of litigation reserves in the first quarter of last year. And we hope that the numbers will remain low but we can't predict them for you, I'm afraid. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure. Okay. But said another way, you guys don't see anything changing in the environment that would lead you to believe or be comfortable with a lower level of assumption of litigation expenses when we think about you? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    They're always going to be lumpy because we have to deal with these things in due course. I think in the prior years we put away a lot. We've always kept the same, predominantly mortgage, largely mortgage, et cetera. And obviously the fact we're not doing more means we think we've gotten there. We did a lot of work on that. It could always change. But we've done thorough analysis. As a lot of you all did, by the way. We did it at the tranche level almost. So, could it be permanently lower? Yes, it could be permanently lower. It doesn't have to go higher. But, obviously, a lot of things coming our way and we'll have to reserve appropriately as they come in. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Let's hope so. Okay. And then the spread in mortgage compression was meaningful here this quarter. What inning do you think we're in there, ballpark? I know it's tough to predict, as well. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it's tough to predict but maybe the thing you could look at is, if you take our pretax spread right now of 100 basis points, that compares to a longer-term average run rate of 65 basis points before the crisis. We've been stepping down from a very high level at the beginning of 2012. And we're back to a level where, frankly, we're not that far away from the longer-term run rate. And it's driven by the primary-secondary spread, which came in about 20 basis points in the quarter, back to levels that, again, feel more normal. I don't know I could say what inning we're in, I'm not a sports person, but it doesn't feel like we have another big step change to go. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But we expect it might be up a little bit next quarter, not down, for a variety of reasons. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. There's going to be volatility quarter on quarter, but for this year we think we're in and around this range. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So this is the right way to think about it. That helps. And then last one from me, when you think about your cap markets business and the pending change, you guys chatted a little about it with Glenn on the swap clearing, that June seems like the bigger date, Basel and all of the subsequent changes to the competitive environment, competitors adjusting the size of their business and what have you, how do you feel about your business there, particularly on the fixed side, more capital intensive businesses? Do you think that this presents an opportunity to maybe go through review and right-size, maybe increase the efficiency measures there? Or do you feel comfortable keeping your business where it is, roughly? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A lot of that business is -- we call it flow business. So we look at credit, emerging markets, rates, FX. The clients -- we deal with clients all around the world and they need those services. Obviously, we always try to become more efficient. So if you look at FX, I'm going to say 80% is electronic. If you look at rates, the electronic number's going to go up. And so we're going to drive efficiency. But we still think clients are going to need it. There will be spreads to pay for it. And, obviously, everyone is going to be adjusting to Basel III. As you pointed out, some people leaving the business, some are getting into the business. We think it has a good future. We don't think it's going to go away. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. I just had one follow-up question to Betsy's inquiry on capital return. Clearly we now have two years of this stress test behind us. And you were initially approved in 2012 for a $15 billion buyback and $6 billion this year. What does the Fed need to see -- and you're building capital, clearly -- what do you think the Fed needs to see from you in terms of the qualitative issues, to get back to the kind of capital return that they clearly in 2012 -- they thought you had plenty of capacity to pay out? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think you're confusing two different things. I really think that quality -- they're going to give us more feedback on where they say we fell short in quality. I've mentioned them -- idiosyncratic, more level detail, more enterprise-wide type of forecasting, et cetera. That's one issue. The second is the actual dollar amount. The Fed has made it very clear, they want people to get to their Basel III targets. Ours is at least 9.5%. Ben Bernanke said on a speech he gave that the banks that they did the stress tests on have more capital after extreme stress than they started in the crisis. So the Fed, I think, is feeling more and more comfortable, not just individual banks but the system as a whole. And we reduced the 15 down to 6 because we wanted to get to our 9.5% target faster. That's why we did it. We just changed our mind. We want to get to 9.5% this year, we want to get to LCR this year. And obviously they may change the stress test next year. And assume we're going to have a conservation buffer coming in. And we don't know how the interplay of those two things will work. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And given what you just mentioned, is it too optimistic to assume for next year a buyback in the $12 billion to $15 billion range? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think it's too early. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it's too early for us to tell that. Remember, that's going to relate to how fast you grow and other requests from regulators. So we'll take that when we get there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, but we do -- Erika, we do expect that we will be continuing to grow capital just through this 100 basis points of passive runoff from mitigation. Certainly our capital levels will be stronger and we're just going to have to see how things play out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Loan growth, it's a little bit softer. And I think you mentioned there was some push forward to the fourth quarter. But you also mentioned more competition and lower levels of demand, if I heard you correctly. So my question is how much of the softer loan growth is due to JPMorgan perhaps pulling back and how much is due to the economy? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So, if I could -- a little difficult to side it for you. But we did see a lot of still the pull forward to the fourth quarter, just given the year-end issues that people were concerned about. And so that has had an impact. I think it's slightly less of an impact than in terms of the competitive landscape. And there are deals being done with terms and conditions and pricing that we're not comfortable with at the moment, and we're just remaining very disciplined. So that has had an impact for us. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So, really, on the lower level of demand, what was your loan utilization in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Broadly flat. Broadly flat, around 32%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'm sorry? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Broadly flat at around 32%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    32%? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Correct. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And so what's that? Flat or down a little bit? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Broadly flat. Flat. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Flat. And is that just -- why aren't people borrowing more? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Actually, we saw declines in deposits. So they're using their cash. They're waiting it out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then a separate question, looking at the annual report. Page 4 of the Chairman's letter refers to regulation and some of the issues that you faced, and said we will see more of these. So when you say we will see more of these, Jamie, what are you talking about? Because people's imaginations can go in a lot of different directions. Are we talking Department of Justice, SEC, FBI? Were you thinking of anything in particular or in general or a time frame? And really what I'm asking you to address is the regulatory tail risk of we don't know what we don't know in terms of potential government moves as it relates to JPMorgan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike, it's Marianne. We're in constant dialogue with our regulators. And so we know that we should be expecting some more consent orders. But to clarify for you, they relate to issues that we've been working on over the course of the last several years. So these are not new breaking issues that will surprise you in any material way. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And was there anything new as part of the '11 hearings that would change the way you would think about the London Whale incident because there was some pretty damning information, some unknowns, at least to those of us who follow the Company. But from your perspective, is there anything else you need to do as a result of the information from those hearings? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike, we can't really go into the detail of the reports in specifics. But we obviously respect the work of the subcommittee. We respect the findings they had and we're working very hard to fix our issues. As it relates to the proposal and the recommendation to require documentation associated with portfolio hedging, identifying the specific risks that the hedge is designed to mitigate, and then monitoring it over time, we tend to agree that that makes a lot of sense in the context of what we face. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then, lastly, when you talk about some additional changes that need to take place -- and I think some of these are organizational -- is there anything major new that you did not cover at the Investor Day recently? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. And actually there's a couple of things I would say. First, that we're organizing ourselves around the control and regulatory agenda because it's a high priority for us. And we're getting ourselves organized in the same way as we would around a merger or an acquisition. And in doing that we are prioritizing our work. But we're not changing our overall strategy. We're not going to change the way we treat our customers, how we think about growing our businesses. But at the margin we're going to refocus our energies on making sure that we execute on the commitments to improve the control and regulatory environments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the mortgage side of things. Mortgage originations were a little bit stronger than we expected, up about 3%. Applications were down about 8%. You suggested that you thought the gain on sale margins might be relatively flattish going through the next couple of quarters. I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are in terms of the mortgage origination market away from the gain on sale issues that you've been facing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so applications actually have come back up. Rates have come down a little in the second quarter. For us in particular, starting there, we're expecting re-fi volumes to stay high. We did see a little bit of an increase in purchase volumes in the applications in the first quarter, albeit from a smaller base. And also we did the Met Life transaction so we have the opportunity to be working that portfolio. So our view on volumes for the year is that they're going to remain solid, although there will be some volatility really on the back of continued strength in refinancing. And you saw the HARP extension so more broadly for the market I think re-fi including HARP will be a level of support for volumes this year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then, Marianne, a question on NIM. Clearly, your moves on the LCR had some effect on NIM over the last quarter or two. Can you separate what you think the net interest margin movements will be for JPMorgan, excluding your moves for the LCR? Or is it just so intertwined that you really can't do that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Honestly, it's really all part of how we think about positioning the organization. And being compliant with LCR is part of our new reality. It's just a part of -- we've embedded it into just how we're thinking about the overall positioning of the firm. So it's not something we're separating out for you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then, just finally, we saw a fairly sizable decline in value at risk, both in the CIB and overall. Can you give us a little more color as to what's going on there and what we might be able to expect in the second quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's hard for me to predict the second quarter. It is a real reduction in risk across the portfolio including -- and not driven by but including -- the synthetic credit portfolio which we continue to derisk. But it is important to note, if you look across the asset classes, there's been a very significant decline in the levels of volatility that affect the time series for our lookback period. So that, necessarily, bad days rolled off and better days rolled on. And so, when we compute our VaR it's pushing the VaR down lower. So, as long as volatility remains low and we continue to derisk, there's reasons to believe they'll be at or around this level. But it is going to be subject to changes in volatility, as and when they happen. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [105]

    Okay, thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A couple of clean-up things. When you are looking at getting to the 9.5%, did you factor in that 100 basis points or is that something that would be on top of that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's factored in. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes It's an all-in number for us. So, to the degree we expect that to happen by the year end, it's all part of the number, including some capacities to buy shares, the whole thing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. Okay. And talking qualitatively about the CCAR process also, there was a pretty large impact on PPNR, which seemed to be like the Fed's looking at pretty harsh -- a pretty harsh look at trading losses. Have you had any clarity from them about whether they're looking at that revenue stream differently than other banking revenue streams? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'll take the two things separately, the PPNR separate from trading losses. On the trading losses, obviously there's a number of different stresses that we do. And while our number was different, I don't think we feel like there's anything about our processes that is materially going to change. But as it relates to PPNR, we did get feedback that we need to look at certain of our revenue models and we need to look at them more centrally. And, as Jamie said, with a slightly more negative view, idiosyncratically. And we're going to do that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then, lastly, on the mortgage business, it looked like in the core production, the expense reduction was about 50% of the revenue decline. How do you think about, as that business continues to normalize, as you said, it's probably mostly normalized from a gain on sale perspective, although you probably have some volume issues as we go through the rest of the year. How do you think about the cost structure of that business as you go forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So, a couple of things. One is, we are expecting to, and hoping to -- we've set a target for ourselves to gain share -- we do expect volumes to be supported by refinancing this year. That is our expectation. It could change, of course. As it relates to the cost structure, obviously that comes down a little bit more slowly over time but we're making progress. And we talked about the fact that we expect that to be down at $600 million run rate for the fourth quarter. And down to $325 million sometime over the next couple of years. And we're actively working on optimizing our servicing business, both the core performing servicing -- and you saw that obviously with the Met Life deal -- but also, where it would make sense, we would be open to doing sales on subservicing of delinquent loans. And we're working through all those things to try and get to cost structures to the best place it can be.

Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. I thought this was one of the cleaner quarters in a while. So I just had one follow-up here. In the private equity, you took some losses from the private portfolio. Just wondering what drove that. And then also the outlook for this business under Basel III and Volcker, even though we don't exactly know what Volcker is yet. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The private equity, we've always told you, is lumpy. It was just markdowns and write-downs of existing positions. And we don't go through the specific names. But, obviously, we hope it will earn a profit. It just wasn't a particularly good quarter for private equity. And the private equity legally can survive Volcker and all those things. We like the business. We like the people. And you just have to do it in a different basis, that's all. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Is there any seasonality in terms of getting year-end or mid-year statements on the private portfolios? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. There's no seasonality in private equity. It's constantly being reviewed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And it's lumpy. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [121]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

    Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous Research. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The first thing I wanted to ask was if we could dig in a little bit on the repurchase losses within mortgage servicing. Such a big swing versus the fourth quarter, an $81 million -- it sounds like a reserve build because I think I heard you say that your actual realized losses were not significant. And yet the guidance remains that it should be a net zero. So it just seemed like there were a lot of moving parts there. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little sense for why you had the $81 million hit. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Absolutely. Guy, it's a big change from the fourth quarter, off a small number. So, not to diminish the size of the numbers, but positive $50 million, negative $80 million, plus or minus around the zero level. What that's a factor of, Guy, is that the reserve release is based upon our model, and realized losses is based upon agency activity. So the timing isn't exactly perfect. So realized losses came down from about $200 million to $180 million. And we didn't build reserves. We released them, just not at the same order of magnitude. And it's really to do with timing, which is why we say that we do expect over time they'll net to zero. Last quarter it was a small positive. This quarter it's a small negative. Nothing to read into it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thanks for that. With regard to the CCAR process and some of the changes that the Fed is asking you to make, first of all, just qualitatively can you give us a sense for the amount of dialogue that you have with the Fed as you work towards satisfying their request, so that you really know exactly where they thought the deficiencies were? Or is there a lot of guesswork for you on that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're in constant dialogue with the regulators. We obviously can't comment on the specifics of our conversations with them. We've had some very constructive conversations as we came out the 2013 CCAR process. And on the basis of those we're actively working to make the improvements they want us to make. But also expecting to continue to get more and more detailed feedback and actually hope to get some industry best practice information, too. So we're going to be working in partnership with them, in constant dialogue, all the way through this year so that we can be clear on what success looks like. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And just if I can follow up on I think it was Moshe's question about the PPNR. It sounded like you were saying that many of the deficiencies that they were focusing on were in the inputs to the calculation of the stress PPNR specifically. Did I understand that right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We haven't gotten a lot of feedback yet. So there will be more to come. But we're going to be geared up to do it. And I think we want to be best-in-class in CCAR. The answer is [absolutely positive] in PPNR. I mentioned just one -- idiosyncratic exposure and risk in PPNR. When you go through a stress test, you can assume that your company is just dealing with all those macroeconomic factors with your forecast. You can assume your company is going through those macroeconomic forecasts plus you're under some other kind of stress and you can lose market shares. Obviously that would change your PPNR. So we'll be having more dialogue and trying to figure out and make sure we do the right thing here. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [129]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. I hope this doesn't sound too crazy but just to think about it the other way, is there any chance that after the resubmission, or as part of the resubmission, given how close you are to your Basel III targets, and with some of that 100 basis points coming in, is there any chance that you would ask for and could get an increase for this year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. This is just a resubmission of the progress program. And they like to see qualitative improvement. This is not a change of request at all. This is the one that Marianne referred to that will be in the third quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [131]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, that's what I'm talking about. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [132]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We'll obviously do another CCAR in January. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [133]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. And then final question. You mentioned, Jamie, in the shareholder letter that just because you don't have big fancily-named cost-cutting programs, it doesn't mean you're not very focused on cost reduction. Is that what we're seeing in the fact that if you look at the CIB your comp was down 7% versus your revenue being plus? Or is it that you did something different in the way you think about through-the-year accruals? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [134]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. The through-the-year accruals is almost exactly the same. It's based upon -- there's a lot of stuff that goes into that number but that really hasn't changed that much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. And actually you've got to normalize out the DVA, which was a large loss last quarter. If we normalize that out, revenues are down. So it's not comped down on revenue. (multiple speakers) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's fair. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [137]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I was referring to that we're constantly putting in new operationals, new systems to reduce overhead. Marianne already mentioned a bunch of things we're doing in Mortgage. You're seeing similar efforts in Consumer. That's a constant effort. We do have names for some of them, by the way. I'm just not going to mention them here. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [138]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. But there's nothing different, like you said, in terms of the way you accrue for bonuses within the investment bank? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [139]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [140]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [141]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. Good morning. I had some questions on the Commercial Banking line of business. You had a nice increase in the real estate lending area in the first quarter. It looked like it was about $9 billion after four quarters of essentially flat to down real estate loans. Can you give us some color on where the growth was? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think you're referring to the CTL, the commercial term lending, which is lending against multi-family. And we have seen growth in it. Remember, that stuff is like 65% LTV. It did great through this last downturn so we're very comfortable with that kind of lending. I forgot where you --. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Are you guys finding greater demand or are you just more comfortable with it now than you were maybe a year ago? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [146]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would say a little of both. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [147]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Following up on your answer about corporate deposits dropping in the quarter, which obviously is a good sign if companies are using this for capital improvements, what's your outlook? Do you expect that to continue? Should we see that as a continued positive trend? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Are you talking about the commercial bank or the total Company? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Commercial bank. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [150]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We would expect to be flat to down a little bit as companies use their -- they have a lot of deposits. So I think we, at Investor Day and earlier, told people they were really high and we expected it to come down, particularly before people start using their revolvers. So they do relate to each other. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [151]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I agree. Are your guys on the front line hearing that from your customers, that they expect to use more for the remainder of the year, do you think? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [152]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I don't know the answer to that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [153]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Coming back to loan loss reserves, obviously you've got a great capital position. You pointed out that Bernanke has indicated that the banking system is super strong going through the stress test. With the current level of loans of about $729 billion, what would be a normal reserve level in normal times compared to where you are today? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [154]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We did a whole page for you on where we thought the through-the-cycle reserve levels should be by business. And there are some businesses -- mortgage, most obviously -- that still have a way to go. And there are other businesses in the wholesale space, in the commercial bank, that are below that through the cycle. I would refer you back to that page. If you do the numbers, from recollection, on an annualized basis, our charge-offs have been more like $7 billion or $8 billion, which, while that is not dissimilar to charge-offs we've seen, it's for different reasons. So I would take a look at that page. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [155]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's mostly mortgage that will come down. Think of everything else as close to normal. Mortgage, which in total is $9 billion, will eventually be a lot lower than that. But that could take a couple of years. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, thank you very much. I know a lot of my questions have been answered but we saw yesterday that they extended the HARP out another two years. And there's also some discussion coming out of some of the -- inside the White House, really, that they could put some type of PR plan behind HARP to try to get more people to HARP. Do you think this will have any impact at all in getting more people off the sidelines and refi-ing through the HARP programs? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [159]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To talk for us specifically, as you probably know, we've been very successful and proactive as it's relating to HARPing our own book. And by the end of this year we fully expected to have been as successful and mine that as far as possible, or they will carry on. That's not the case in the industry. So it's great news that HARP was extended out to the end of 2015. And it will allow for other servicers to get their ducks in a row and potentially to have cross service to HARP. Which, in turn, should be good in terms of volumes, although I don't think it will be a step change. For us we're not expecting it to be a significant difference in our production or in our MSR value. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [160]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I don't know if you can disclose this or not, but how much do you think you have HARP eligible? And how many of those HARP-eligible loans did you do on a percentage basis? Do you think you've touched most of them already? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [161]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We talked about we peaked in our HARP volumes in about second quarter of last year. I think overall, first half of last year was high, came down slightly, overall 15% last year. We talked at Investor Day that we thought that would go down to the high single digits this year, and it is, in terms of percentage of our production. And we are very active and have been very proactive in mailing our HARP population. And expected to have completed the program by the end of the year. So we were on track and this doesn't change our expectations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [162]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think the total -- if you take all mortgages, I think the number's like 4 million would be HARP-able today if they went to it. I'm somewhat surprised that more people don't do it, to tell you the truth. Anything the government can do, either PR, I think the cross-servicing is probably a bigger one, will make it slightly better. The thing was just slightly better. It's not going to dramatically change mortgage. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [163]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. I think a lot of companies have told us that they think that they've gotten through most of the low-hanging fruit with HARP, and that the people that aren't HARPing they doubt they will ever HARP. So I'm just wondering, if there's a big PR push, if some of those guys will wake up and say -- maybe I need to look at this program. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [164]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We hope so. We don't know any better than you.

Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A quick question back to the Brown stuff that's hanging around out there. I'm reading what everybody else is, that they're looking at a 10% capital ratio, with the possibility of another 5% buffer on top of that. And basically throwing away the concept of risk-weighted assets. And more or less eviscerating Basel III, as far as I can see. Do you guys have any sense where this 10%, 5% number comes from? Is there some empirical evidence? Or is this just a back door way to try to get the biggest banks to break up? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman & CEO    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You really have to ask them. We'll leave this to them and the regulators, okay? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [169]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Do you have a sense where the numbers are coming from? What that 10% capital ratio, where it comes from?
