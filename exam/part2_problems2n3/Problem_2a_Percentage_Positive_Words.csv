call_id;answer_id;n_total_words;n_positive_words;f_positive_words;answer_text1;1;101;1;0.009900990099009901;yes, we obviously have to make some assumptions going forward in house prices and they are not that different than the assumptions you would see in most other that get published by case-shiller, etc. right now, they have a modest increase in home prices in 2013 and '14. i will stick with just those two years. but if it was 5% better than that, which is possible, that would run through our books in lower charge-offs and lower reserves. and just as a rule of thumb, $500 million for one year. it's a very rough rule of thumb.
1;2;89;0;0.0;yes, no, we are required under dodd-frank to disclose our stress tests. remember, we do -- in march. we do it almost immediately after the fed's report. and remember, we do hundreds. the fed is four. so we look at multiple kind of stress tests and we are going to try to give you a full view of how we look at the company under stress. i should point out that a lot of you did it yourselves in the past. you were pretty accurate some of you.
1;3;182;1;0.005494505494505495;just to give you a view, we have $200 billion of equity and $250 billion of unsecured debt. that is $450 billion. that is a lot of capital before anyone else bears a loss. it is not clear to me that subordinated versus just unsecured, and it would take time to develop those markets. if a bank has 50/50 or -- obviously it changes the nature a little bit over time, so it will take time to develop. but i think we're working with the authorities to get it right, to do the analysis right, to have the right numbers. i think you have a little time before someone says it has to be this amount. remember, we have got basel i, basel ii, basel iii, ola, lcr nsf and the new one and we are going to be able to accommodate all of them. it will take a little bit of time. i do want to point out that we fully intend in 2013, late 2013, to be a 9.5% basel iii and to be fully compliant with lcr.
1;4;120;1;0.008333333333333333;well, we had done giving you some numbers in our annual report last year about where it is a no-brainer to buy back stock, which i said is tangible book value. tangible book value is now $38 or $39, which has gone up, what is it, $4 this year, almost $5 this year. so we still think if you haircut earnings and buy stuck at these prices, it's probably still a good deal. we got permission to buy back $3 billion in the first quarter. obviously, it is going to be a little price-sensitive and then ccar will set what we can buy back for the next four quarters after that. i hope that answers your -- yes.
1;5;88;2;0.022727272727272728;you can do the same numbers at today's prices. discount, if you want to be conservative, discount earnings, buy back stock. at the end of a two or three-year period, you will apply earnings per share and higher tangible book value per share even at these prices. it seems like a pretty good deal to me. typically, you have a good company. and you are not going to need the capital down the road. i am not talking about for one year, but down the road.
1;6;58;0;0.0;think about it as all in and we are expecting our run rate in the future to be i think $300 million to $350 million, as i said, excluding the items we talked about. including ifr, we are at $725 million. we have got a ways to go, but it is coming down. think about it in there.
1;7;174;4;0.022988505747126436;well, i think let me just put out first off that our comp ratio was 33%. if you, by the way, if you added back some of the bonuses paid in corporate that do not show up as comp in the ib, it would be like 35%. we think that the roundest number is kind of an ongoing run rate. we have formulas. we do not pay out necessarily by the formula, but we have formulas that are capital-adjusted, risk-adjusted, etc., etc. that -- that is what really guides it and it is not -- so it is really done at a much more detailed level than it will bounce around that 35%. i should point out that again we feel good that our roe in the investment bank was 17% this year. it was 16% or 17% last year and the year before and we are paying our people fair and well. i feel good about that. that is a good thing. that is a good business model to have something like that.
1;8;45;1;0.022222222222222223;yes, i think that is probably true, but other firms have ratios of 50%, 55%. ours is already fairly low. we want to win in the business. we are going to be competitive in compensation and obviously that will adjust over time as competition changes.
1;9;89;3;0.033707865168539325;at investor day, we will try to give you a better view of that. so there are clearly some negatives and we do not know all the rules, also some positives. so we are in a position between custody and clearing and our brokers businesses to provide some of those services for investors so they can allocate capital properly, transform the collateral and serve them better. so let the rules come out. obviously, this is going to affect our revenues a bit, but there will be opportunities there too.
1;10;168;2;0.011904761904761904;no, here is my caveat. we are going to meet lcr this year whatever it is. it does not matter to us whether we like it or not. now to answer your question, there were some changes in lcr SEMICOLON i think they were good, but they still capped the benefit like mortgages and we have like almost $90 billion of mbs. so government-guaranteed mbs is in what they call level 2 and therefore, you are restricted in how much [capital] liquidity. now personally i think that is wrong, but it is okay. we will live with it, we are moving on. i do not know why the american regulators would agree to that. government-guaranteed mbs in a market you want where they treated liquid and remember, they already have a 15% haircut. i could argue they do not need any haircut, but look, whether changes are made or not, we are going to be compliant. it is not going to affect our earnings that much.
1;11;142;2;0.014084507042253521;yes, so hey, betsy, we talked about the third quarter being -- peaking at over 200 basis points before the margins compress in some 40 or so basis points in the quarter and we do expect that to continue into 2013, not at that level. if you go back in time, you would see gain-on-sale margins more in the 65 basis points. i do not know if that is where it will end, but certainly we expect for that to be seen through 2013, but with gaining marketshare. we hope to keep our volumes up. obviously, it will normalize over time, but it may not go that low because our expenses could also be permanently higher. to be in the business is going to cost more money and obviously that will be part of your -- what you have to earn back.
1;12;245;0;0.0;yes, so we -- the number that marianne showed you is the basel iii tier 1 common 8.7. if you look at what i call for the next two years passive mitigation, that is run-off and what i call normal models, so we still have to get certain models in there and there is not arguing with anybody, it's just models that should be put in place, that would add almost 1% to basel right off the bat. about i am going to say $100 billion of that would be models, $80 billion to $100 billion would be models. part of that is the runoff to synthetic credit, which is obviously coming down over time. and the other thing, which i think you're going to see, is we are pushing basel iii down, we have, but we are pushing it down at a very detailed level. i think over time you're going to see (inaudible) down capital basel rwa even more. and there are things in basel, which i do not know what the future portends. we have $200 billion plus of operational rwa in there now. that is driven very -- that is like $16 billion of capital. that is driven very high by obviously the mortgage litigation and stuff like that, some of which will go away. so one day, a lot -- that $200 million should come down a lot too. i just do not know the timetable for that.
1;13;17;0;0.0;no, i did not mention -- we are going to get there late in 2013 whatever it takes.
1;14;218;0;0.0;we will answer -- to give you more feedback -- maybe we have to have a buffer. we do not know what the final rules are for capital. so you already have a conservation buffer. you go below what happens. obviously, oci could be a big swing. like if you model -- i forgot -- we had modeled it. like 300 basis points would be $20 billion after tax or something like that. but you could handle that too because it is going to come in over time and you can manage your balance sheet going forward, your stock buyback going forward. so we really need to see the future rules to make that determination. if we need a buffer, we will have a buffer. whatever that is, we will go there right away too, but we just do not know what it is yet. and we do not know whether ccar is going to drive capital or the conservation buffer is going to drive capital or whatever. and we do not know how the g-sifi exactly works, even though we know it's a 2.5%. we will probably find ways to reduce that over time. so we have plenty of capital. right now, i am -- far more than i personally think we need, but we have plenty of capital.
1;15;194;0;0.0;well, unfortunately, that is a one-year thing, okay and i should point out that before you ask is that when we started the dividends, we said that the intent would be to increase them a little bit every year, so you should expect to see that. we are going to ask for less capital return from stock buyback than we have in the past so where i can do $3 billion in the first quarter. we are going to do less because we have determined, and this is a board-level determination too, that we want to get to 9.5% quicker and we do not exactly know how these stress tests work. so we think under severe stress, we would have plenty of capital, but the last time the fed's numbers were very different. we do not understand that and the way ccar has done this year has even more volatility. basel 2.5 is far more volatile in how you calculate rwa, oci and all that than the old basel i test. so we are a little cautious, which i think is what obviously the fed expected people to do.
1;16;251;0;0.0;yes, let me just separate the two. in consumer, credit card is near the end. there could be more, but it is near the end. it's really mortgage. mortgage reserves are going to have to come down as charge-offs come down and charge-offs are going to come down. we are not trying to manipulate our earnings or anything like that. they are going to come down. the portfolios are smaller SEMICOLON housing prices are going up. we just do not know exactly the pace they are going to come down, but remember they are half what they were a year and a half ago and my guess is, in a year and a half to two from now, they will be half of what they are today, which implies the reserves will come down. we have $5 billion left SEMICOLON that implied would be $2.5 billion. so nothing magical there. that is what is in the numbers. it is really a matter of timing, etc. on the cib side, it was really -- we had one or two big recoveries, so we did have, what was it, $400 million, but marianne also pointed out there were some other negatives that got booked in cib too. so you are right SEMICOLON we are not going to have much reserve takedown in cib, but the other negatives will not be there either. so it is a little bit of a wash in cib too from other non-reserve-related stuff.
1;17;299;2;0.006688963210702341;i would not call it a strong fourth-quarter showing. we kind of made an assumption that the last two weeks of the year are pretty dead in terms of activity and we were a little bit wrong about that. but here is what i would say. activity now is continuing SEMICOLON it is usually strong in the first part of the year. we do not know. but i personally believe that this has been, and i have been consistent about this, a cyclical, a secular change. we deal with 16,000 investors. investable assets are going up SEMICOLON they are not going down. global trade is going up SEMICOLON it is not going down. high net worth assets, i'm talking over 10 years and so there is a need that people have to buy and sell securities, etc. so i think the underlying trend is up and obviously spreads will compress over time. they have by the way for 20 years. that will continue. and now we have got a bunch of model changes, not models, but like business model changes from swaps and derivatives and regulations. we will adjust all that, but there is a chance you're going to wake up one day and it will be a boomer year and no one is going to predict that either. there is a chance we happen to go into recession that it will get worse, but my attitude is i think we are very well-positioned in the business. it is very broad-based between fx rates, credits, securitized products, commodities. it is very global, emerging markets driven by research, which marianne mentioned we are number one. so over time, it will grow. i just can not predict what it is going to do next quarter.
1;18;113;4;0.035398230088495575;yes. look, i think the american economy -- i've said the table is rather well set. consumers, businesses, housing, small business they are all in pretty good shape and i think we need good policy and good fiscal policy, but yes, so we expect to see -- we have had, which i think you mentioned, we have had run-off in consumer too. remember, in card, from (inaudible) and some other stuff and we are running off sort of businesses and certain things we got out of, but you could start to see a little bit of growth now going forward in outstandings. good growth in spending, a little bit of growth in outstandings.
1;19;56;0;0.0;yes, so, hey, john, we will do that for you at our investor day in a lot of detail. i think the way to think about our adjusted expenses going forward, you should think about them being flat to down in terms of direction and we will go through all of that for you in february.
1;20;4;0;0.0;yes, around $50 billion.
1;21;106;0;0.0;one day we hope. (multiple speakers). so we do not -- yes, we will not -- we can not predict the litigation expense, i'm sorry. i think the one part, which i just want to reiterate, is that obviously that one is going to be lumpy and be ongoing except the part relating to mortgages. we have done a lot of work on and we are hoping that we are properly reserved there and they are not going to see duplication of that. in the last couple of years of litigation, a lot of it related to mortgages. not all of it, but a lot of it.
1;22;74;0;0.0;you have got me there. i think if we buy back $3 billion and what we issue -- i think we issue -- 2.5. -- amortizes in over time as we issue it -- right. -- so my guess is it will go down a little bit in the first quarter. when you issue restricted stock, it does not immediately go into fully diluted. that goes in as it amortizes. remember this stuff amortizes over three years generally.
1;23;15;0;0.0;if we spend the whole $3 billion, my guess is it will go down, yes.
1;24;1;0;0.0;yes.
1;25;61;0;0.0;yes, i think, john, in part, that is it. i can get back to you with more specific details. it did come down slightly in the quarter. it does reflect the combination of our full understanding of all of the rules, plus some model changes and everything else in the quarter and bau activity, but we can get you more detail.
1;26;50;0;0.0;yes, well, so we are continuing to grow our deposits very strongly. we are continuing to grow our loans very strongly, so core loan growth up 9%. so all in all, we are generally holding pace with nim compression and hope to see the same next year plus or minus.
1;27;24;1;0.041666666666666664;it was better by over $100 million versus the fourth quarter last year. of course, last year was not particularly good by the way.
1;28;986;8;0.008113590263691683;completely off. let me tell you where - you raised a lot of subjects SEMICOLON let me do them one by one. obviously, when you have a problem like the whale, you have mistakes, which you should acknowledge and then fix. so we obviously fixed cio totally 100%. people in it, reporting, risk, controls, committees, guidelines and we do not do synthetic credit there at all. but some of those mistakes obviously scared us and we went and checked everywhere in the company. so we are fixing certain things across the company. not that they are bad, they are not disasters, but they require fixing. and so when you have an accident like that, you want to say we are going to use this to get stronger, better, smarter, tougher. and we have to and we are going to. obviously you can not meet every demand of the regulators. so we have got real resources doing it. we have already done a lot of it. we are going to continue to do more. so yes, they were changes from the whale. number two, we are in business to build the business over time by serving clients. that is what we do. we do it every -- we take risk. when you take risks, you make loans SEMICOLON you take risks when you invest money SEMICOLON you take risk when you build systems and branches. but that is what we have been doing consistently and i hope you see in the underlying numbers more branches, more bankers, more custody, more trading, more products, more services, more countries, happier clients in every business. record results in commercial banking, asset management, a lot of cross-sell in that and we are going to do a lot more to describe to you the competitive benefits that we get in this company because the different business units work together and things like that. so that part of the business has not changed. that is why we are here. even cio has always been doing that, investing assets conservatively because i was watching something on tv today -- you have to earn a return on your assets. the book -- you are not going to try to earn a return on your assets is ludicrous to me and to manage asset liability exposure generally conservatively. we obviously made a mistake. and the third thing, the reorganization, that was around -- and i (inaudible) do a lot of this for you, around the client. if you said rebuild the company from the ground up, you probably would have organized it around the clients, not necessarily by product. it is not that we were bad or banks were bad or anything like that SEMICOLON it is that companies acquired mortgage companies, they acquired credit card companies, they acquired retail branches. the power of that franchise is extraordinary. 40% of our retail branches own credit cards -- are credit cards today. a big chunk of our mortgage sales come out of the branches. most of our small businesses serve out of the branches. middle-market is served out of the branches. the branches are becoming an enormous competitive advantage for asset management. the commercial bank could not survive without them. so all we did is say put together those businesses under one roof where you want to have -- you want to treat the client the way they want to be treated when they come in the front door. same thing for cib, the same client set in the investor side and the issuer side, the corporate side. so we go to any country. we serve the big companies, we serve the sovereign wealth funds, we serve the governments. we serve them out of tss and we serve them out of the investment bank. all we are doing here is better coordination, which we think will have more cross-sell and believe it or not lower expenses. plus it will help us deal with the new regulatory environment. so both of these things are going to help us deal with the new regulatory environment to have consistent standards across all the businesses, etc. so that is why we had the reorg. and management changes, you went through the litany of changes, but just remember daniel pinto has been in that business his whole life. mike cavanagh has been here for many years and was already running ts&s. doug petno has been running the commercial bank for several years now. gordon smith and todd maclin, we did it a little bit faster than we told people. we told people we were going to put that under one roof. marianne lake has been the controller of the ib and the cfo of the consumer bank. all the people in these jobs have been here a long time and they are very good. i mean i think it is an exceptional management team. it is too much turnover, but again the way i look at the turnover, if i have 15 people in the operating committee, you should assume that 15% to 20% every year will turn over. some years will be zero and some years will be more. when you have reorgs and stuff like that, it is a little bit more. hopefully, you're going to have stability. we have got a great management team. they are working a lot of different things. most have been here a long time. and part of it, part of it relates to -- remember if you were on my board of directors, you would be asking me, in fact instructing me to make sure you were putting in place in big jobs the people who have to be tested to see if they can do my job. that is -- i mentioned this many years ago, that is job number one. that takes precedence over all other things. and sometimes it leads to turnover. i'm sorry.
1;29;68;2;0.029411764705882353;well, look, you should get to know them, but you could evaluate their quality, their integrity, their brains. mary erdoes has been here a long time. matt zames, who is now co-chief operating -- frank bisignano both been here a long time. so these are long tenured, very good, respected employees. and so i know it is going to work. obviously, you have to make that evaluation yourself.
1;30;57;0;0.0;not really, but the ccar does have this qualitative aspect, which i do not exactly know what that means, but not really. it really related more to the desire -- the stock price is higher and the desire to get to 9.5% quicker. everyone's being doing it and obviously we should not lag. that's all.
1;31;489;10;0.02044989775051125;also, mike (inaudible) because you had me do a little work after one of your reports came out about stock price. so do this yourself. take bank one's stock price from the day before i got there to today, and take jpmorgan's stock price from the day we announced the deal to today, compare it to the s&p, the bank, the bank index or all other major firms and it's actually rather good. it outperformed in both cases, the bank by a long shot. in both cases, the s&p not by a long shot but by a significant margin and almost most other financial companies. so obviously something has been working a little bit here. opportunity, i think the opportunities are fabulous. so next year, we are going to focus a tremendous amount of regulatory requirements, these consent orders getting things done, but also just organic growth. small business, marianne mentioned, is up almost everywhere, partially in florida and california where wamu gave us the opportunity to do that. we opened our 1000th branch in california. we are still going to open net over 100 branches this year. our credit card has been growing. the chase private client, we have got 250 branches to 1200 chase private client. that number is going to go up -- and i do not know if we've -- i do not know if that is public -- okay, now it's public -- to something like 2000 end of next year. it is really working. so it is growing dramatically. our mutual fund complex has been growing. ts&s, actually not ts&s, the global corporate bank has opened multiple branches overseas. we have gone from 120 global corp bankers to 286 or something. it is going to be north of 300 and it is working. if you look at investment banking revenues out of the commercial bank, when we first got here, i think it was like $450 million. this year, it hit almost $2 billion and we think the opportunity to continue to grow is large. so in almost every single business, we see very good opportunities to grow and obviously, we operate in a difficult world, the financial services, but in the investment bank, it was -- it has been -- marianne went through the numbers, but we do not see why we can not continue to grow that around the world and serve more clients in more places like colombia or in some of the emerging markets. in commercial banking, we opened branches in non -- states we do not have branches, which have been focused on kind of larger clients and international. that is working well. international commercial bank is working well and all these numbers are in here. you guys should go through it soon. they are all pretty good and you are going to see us continue to focus on growing those businesses in a quality way.
1;32;115;1;0.008695652173913044;well, i think you should look at it -- we are already fully engaged in meeting all of those concents and other regulatory demands. remember, we have changing rules and requirements. we also have a lot of items that the regulators have asked us to focus on, their consent orders. so yes, it is a tremendous amount of resource, but it is not going to change the numbers you see. it is just the people involved -- a lot of people involved in risk credit, legal compliance, audit, hr all are really involved in getting a lot of this stuff right and we have to do that. of course and people in the business too of course.
1;33;164;3;0.018292682926829267;yes, so, matt, you would have seen that we pretty much portfolio all the jumbos we originate right now. we price them to great returns and we would continue to do that. we like that asset. i think overall across the firm, we did $5 billion of jumbos this quarter and so you should expect to see that continue. i would just add that one of the things you learn to live with a little bit is that you could put a mortgage on your balance sheet and earn or 3.75% or 4% if it is a jumbo or something like that. it does not have oci. it holds more capital, but it might be a wiser thing to do than taking the gain on sale and then buying an mbs at 2.25%. so there are all these opportunities to think through how to manage in the new world properly both for the client and for the shareholder. (multiple speakers). go ahead.
1;34;45;0;0.0;it may be -- and that may change over time and get bigger. so we are doing a little bit more and right now, it is the jumbos. we have done a little bit like c pluses and stuff like that, but there may be others.
1;35;32;0;0.0;we would much prefer loans than securities like in commercial bank, credit card, etc. so the reason we have securities is because we can not generate that kind of loan right now.
1;36;120;0;0.0;i think the qm was a really big start and kind of well thought through, but it also needs to be coordinated with basel iii, some of these npr rules, this whole thing about oci. so all these things are going to affect mortgage a little bit and a lot of players involved in that who have to coordinate it. but i do think over time they will open up the mortgage markets. how rep and warranty is going to be handled, etc. trn, skin in the game. i think securitization will be important. so if i was the government, i would want to get qrm and securitization rules fixed as quickly as i can to allow people to start.
1;37;53;0;0.0;i would say that is probably in line with that. we have excess cash and excess capacity at central banks and that is what that reflects. they are two different numbers, but they move in the same direction. and we will probably disclose more about that at the investor day too. we will.
1;38;28;0;0.0;probably not much. yes, not much. the average yield in the investment portfolio is coming down a little bit every quarter and that will continue for a while.
1;39;35;0;0.0;no. we do break it out. we disclosed it. we have not disclosed it in the fourth quarter. what was it last time? probably like 3. interest duration. so it is probably about the same.
1;40;99;1;0.010101010101010102;the other thing -- right, but the important -- i think the way to look at (inaudible), we would benefit from rising rates. so i've always said that that portfolio is subordinated to the interest of the company. it is very short. you can extend that duration or a lot more income, but then we would be hurt by rising rates and we break out the earnings and risk from rising rates -- if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points, it is about a $2 billion plus pretax. and that comes through the investment portfolio and loan repricing, etc.
1;41;41;0;0.0;i can not -- offhand, it is hard for me to say that, but i think i am going to guess, but like 30 or 40 basis points. it's not a lot to neutralize it -- -- to eliminate -- right, something like that.
1;42;34;0;0.0;the margin? so i think it is in the supplement. i am afraid i --. it's in the production revenue. yes, it's in production revenue, which i think was close to $800 million.
1;43;30;0;0.0;revenue was 3%, 3.5% and net was -- (multiple speakers). so it's like 3.5 times 50, actually is on closed, not --. we will do the math for you.
1;44;101;0;0.0;first of all, it is a board-level decision and in some ways, it is a nice problem to have, but the way you set the question up you almost have no option. you can not buy back stock and you can not raise your dividend. all you have left is something like that. so we will get there when we get there. again, we need to see all the new rules and how they are going to apply like this conservation buffer and we may know more by investor day, but when we know more, we will let you know.
1;45;350;4;0.011428571428571429;so the first one is obviously we do budgets and stuff. we put targets in place, things we would like to accomplish. so that is in how we look at -- we are not going to disclose it to you. but i did say that we do think it is going to enhance revenues and reduce expenses a little bit. so a little bit is in there for the cib and a little bit in there for consumer. and we are going to disclose more at investor day about kind of cross-sell and how we look at it and where we think we can benefit, etc. and if you look at risk-weighted assets, we are up to -- our balance sheet is $2.4 trillion. we have got $200 billion of money deposited in central banks around the world or in repo, very short-term investments, $350 billion in aa securities and $400 billion in securities borrowed or resales. we have a really, really liquid balance sheet. i just mentioned $750 billion, almost $1 trillion of very short-term stuff that is sitting there on our balance sheet in the asset side and our risk-weighted assets are now $1.65 trillion. they have gone up dramatically because of basel 2.5, the fact that we do not have certain models in place that will be accepted. so some of the benefit arguably is going to be just -- i am going to call it run-off. some is from models that regulators expect people to design and put in place that we do not have yet. we just do not have the history or we have not done the modeling and that is -- a lot of it is around credit-related, synthetic credit type stuff, securitizations and things like that. so we are going to put those in place. and that is not arguing with regulators SEMICOLON they would expect us to do that over time. obviously, regulators -- i know they are going to look at how people do models around the world and they want this done fairly, etc.
1;46;132;2;0.015151515151515152;sure. so think about repurchase. so both sides of that we do them separately. so repurchase losses, i told you you will see demand down significantly, you will see the outstanding pipeline down significantly. we have seen cure rates improve and so our realized losses were sub $200 million and it is what it is and it is a factor, a feature of activity obviously and it can vary a little. on the repurchase reserve side, it is obviously model-driven and we use inputs, including things like cure rates. so it is not going to be a perfect offset in this quarter. it happened to be slightly more and over time, over the next few quarters, we think they could largely offset that you might see some small pluses and minuses.
1;47;51;1;0.0196078431372549;yes, and i would say we are in constant dialogue with the agencies and obviously people ask about behavior and we are in constant dialogue, we think we understand the direction it is going and we feel good about where we are right now and we will continue to monitor that.
1;48;108;0;0.0;i do not know how to respond to that. i think -- maybe you can call later and get some more feedback on some of the stuff you said. you can call sarah youngwood at investor relations. but you went through a lot of the stuff that is accurate. obviously we are in an environment -- the environment changes all the time, but we have growth plans everywhere. so it is not like we are sitting on our laurels and just looking at what is going to -- nim compression, stuff like that. so we expect to grow earnings next year. i may be wrong, but that is what we expect.
1;49;5;0;0.0;yes, okay. you're welcome.
1;50;196;1;0.00510204081632653;i think we had said earlier, on july 13, we hope it is almost a nonissue by the end of the year. i think we are getting there. i think from the day that -- and we are not going to give you more detail than what i am about to tell you so do not ask. we had modest losses in the fourth quarter. there is no reason to have any losses going forward. the risk from the date of the investment bank got and they have done a good job continuing to derisk it are down, i am going to say, another 50%. so obviously, there is still risk. it is still a portfolio which has got -- the average duration i am going to say is 2, 2.5 years left. so if you did nothing, it is going to diminish dramatically over time, but i think we have got it well-controlled at this point. there could be some volatility because of the nature of it. it has got some idiosyncratic exposures in there, but we think we are fine. we do not think there's anything that anyone needs to worry about anymore.
1;51;153;1;0.006535947712418301;you have got to do it a little bit by business because i think in consumer mostly sticky, but it is probably a little bit of tag -- like you guys had an estimate for that. yes, like (inaudible) plus or minus. mostly those deposits we would consider core and sticky. right. and then ts&s is a lot of seasonal year-end deposits, so it bounces all over the place. asset management i put in the sticky category. commercial bank has been kind of flat, but it is sticky. it is flat because the loans are starting to grow and it is huge. commercial has $190 billion of deposits. i think that number was $100 billion 3.5 years ago. so they have a lot of money there. we actually expect that might have come down one day as companies start to grow and expand more aggressively, which would be a good thing.
1;52;124;0;0.0;that's a woulda', shoulda', coulda'. i do not know, guy, the answer to that question. i think if they had been put in place -- it depends how they would have ultimately been put in place. so they were delayed to get more work and how it gets done. i think if they had been put in place for jpmorgan where the rules constrained us overseas, but did not constrain other companies overseas, we would be down from what we might now have. if the rules were put in place as we can compete freely in frankfurt, london, singapore and shanghai, my guess is our us revenues would have been down a little bit, our international revenues would have been up a little bit.
1;53;256;3;0.01171875;no, so private equity is $8 billion invested. we expect to earn a return on that. we are obviously getting a great return on it, so that is lumpy, but it should be more than $50 million on average. treasury -- think of treasury as nii. it is very predictable. the nii (inaudible) by quarter. that number will go down a little bit. that is just how we allocate capital and funds between all the business units. and then how we invest the assets. so we can change that tomorrow by having longer duration in our investment portfolio. the lumpier part of treasury and cio is when we have mark-to-market gains and securities gains. that bounces around a little bit and again some of that is discretionary. so we do not look at that -- we should almost call it a net loss, and that number -- i think the $300 million will come down over time, not go up for a whole bunch of different reasons, which i will not go through right now. and then the other corporate -- that has net allocations, boli, coli, taxes, all these lumpy items and we will just try to tell you it should be plus 100 -- it could be on average 100, plus or minus a couple hundred because of lumpiness of those items. like corporate taxes are lumpy for a whole bunch of different reasons and so our numbers would be 100 on average. and we always explain the difference if there is ever a big difference there.
1;54;139;0;0.0;it has got not a damned thing to do with exotic investment strategies, zero, nada, nothing, okay? the bulk of those assets are always invested conservatively, aa plus. we had to do it around the world, so deposits around the world, etc., nothing to do with that. it has all got to do with some of the nim compression that shows up there because obviously investment portfolio yield has gone down a little over 2%. it was 4% three years ago and how we allocate capital and things like that. the changes you have seen. some of them are the differences due to the regulatory changes of b3, rwa and stuff like that. so we will try to make this a little bit clearer going forward. but on average, that number will come down, not go up over time.
1;55;253;1;0.003952569169960474;yes, when we allocate the new basel iii operational capital debt, the capital allocations will go up mostly to the cib by i am going to say 20% or so and to the commercial bank by 20% or so or maybe a little bit more than that. and that will obviously change the return targets for those units. it will also be very healthy, so it will just come down. the company will be exactly the same. i mean so we just have -- i think when we allocate all this stuff intelligently, it will actually probably end up driving better returns over time as people learn how to manage it a little bit differently. so we will be allocating -- again, it eventually will show more. we will be allocating out -- think of it as everything at one point, lcr, g-sifi, basel iii, basel ii, whatever comes down the pike will be allocated out so our managers can manage through it. and the other thing we have not decided permanently is how you look at each business because my feeling has been, this is open for debate, is that the business should be capitalized the way its competitors are going to be capitalized so they would feel free -- they are free to compete in that category. i think the people lump their capital ratios around their competitors. that could be very hard for someone for example to be -- run with 7.5% capital and all their competitors are at 10% or vice versa.
1;56;70;0;0.0;no, cost is cost. it has nothing to do with that. i am talking about capital -- saying we may capitalize the commercial bank at 8.5% and the investment bank at 10%. it may not be 9.5% for everybody because they have to operate, they have to compete in different environments. so that is where you just -- we just have not figured out exactly how to do that yet.
2;1;14;0;0.0;john, we can not hear you. apologies, john, we did not hear the question.
2;2;3;0;0.0;yes, we can.
2;3;71;0;0.0;we're growing, as you've probably seen, we showed you on investor day. and while there was a little bit of lower growth this quarter, we do expect to grow loans in our commercial bank loans in asset management, wholesale loans, mortgage banking. and we're growing our deposits very strongly. so it's really just the underlying business driver growth that we've been seeing and expect to continue.
2;4;80;0;0.0;yes. john, actually, if i refer you back -- and from recollection, i'll do it for you -- but if i refer you back to investor day, it's based upon our adjusted expenses, which are defined as our expenses excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters. which in 2012 was $60 billion, plus or minus. i think $60.1 billion. and we're expecting to be $59 billion this year. and that's what we're on track to deliver.
2;5;16;0;0.0;a little higher than that in the first quarter. but the first quarter is seasonally high.
2;6;91;0;0.0;yes. the fourth-quarter normalized run rate was $725 million. this quarter it's down a little off that, as you would expect, given the ifr completion. we said that we expected the fourth quarter to be running at $600 million. and we said that at investor day and we're still on track to do that. and we've also said that the long-term run rate for that part of the business would be about $325 million a quarter, and that would be over the next couple of years.
2;7;38;0;0.0;the litigation dropped quarter over quarter. clearly we had a large number last quarter on the back of ifr. and we did have litigation expense this quarter, you'll see in the supplementary there, just over $300 million.
2;8;5;0;0.0;yes, that's right, john.
2;9;35;0;0.0;yes, but also remember, we did not buy back shares in the fourth quarter or the third quarter. so there was an overall net $2.6 billion gross] $2,6 billion net of employee issuance.
2;10;1;0;0.0;yes.
2;11;73;0;0.0;no. i think the issuance number is fairly level and consistent quarter by quarter, because it's really based upon amortization of restricted stock and all that. and the buyback, the $2.6 billion, remember, that was over the course of the quarter, so it averaged out to 50% of that for the quarter. so we can give you more detail a little bit later. yes, we'll come back to you john.
2;12;59;1;0.01694915254237288;but the $6 billion will offset how much average amortization over the same 12-month period, like $2 billion. yes, $2 billion. john, that's a good way of looking at it. the $6 billion we're authorized to repurchase relates to employee issuance over the same period of just a little bit over $2 billion. for accounting purposes.
2;13;100;2;0.02;the second one is the big one, that's june 11, or something like that. yes, june 11. and that's where you have a lot of bigger client stuff like that. people are still getting used to it. so we think -- i think we've got 30% or 40% lined up to do it. they're still reading documents, have to sign new documents. so hopefully it will go smoothly. it's unlikely to go smoothly the first round. the first round were really large participants and swap deals, et cetera. we'll have to just wait and see.
2;14;57;0;0.0;look, we really do not know. i would say temporary but probably still down a little bit because of the reason you gave. some feel and just say -- we do not need to do this anymore. and we also know all the final rules, by the way, and how the scfs are going to work in bidding.
2;15;78;0;0.0;yes. if you take -- our basel i rwa went up about $200 million. that's all about the implementation of the new market risk rules in basel 2.5. which is also why you saw our ratio go down from a reported 11% last quarter. it's really all explained by that. and our basel iii rwa was flattish quarter over quarter, with some pluses and some minuses. that was already in there essentially. yes. of course, yes.
2;16;137;2;0.014598540145985401;my recollection -- and, again, glenn, forgive me if i get this wrong -- it's on the slide from the firm overview and investor day -- but i think that 100 basis points equates to about $180 billion of rwa over the next two years. but, remember, the passive runoff will take place over time. not completely linearly but over time. and the model enhancements can be a little bit lumpier and a little bit more back ended. so we'll just have to see how that plays out. but, yes, we're still expecting for those things to happen, for us to get 100 basis points of benefit from that, and that's without the active mitigation. that's going to happen over the course of time. just check that slide for me, glenn, when you get on.
2;17;152;3;0.019736842105263157;glenn, i actually think you all on the line should be dealing with this issue a little bit because the reason you have companies is because they serve clients well at a good cost. there's a reason our numbers are good, because we have cross sell and clients come to us. and there are reasons for global banks, just like there are reasons for community banks. i think the real issue -- again, you guys do the numbers -- is the banking system has gotten so much stronger in the united states. and it's not just capital, but it's capital, liquidity, oversight. activities that people like are no longer being done. derivatives are going to clearing houses. and the initial wave of ola and living wills, et cetera, those things should all work. i hope at one point we declare a victory and just stop eating our young at this thing.
2;18;75;2;0.02666666666666667;betsy, there was a little bit of passive mitigation. there was a little bit of run-off. and there was also some declines as we purchased back some afs securities, and those were offset by some other things. it was not a very big number because, as i say, that will bleed in over time. and the model enhancements which are about 50% of the 100-basis-point benefit will be a bit back ended.
2;19;14;0;0.0;that's right. yes, some of it later this year, some of it next.
2;20;125;2;0.016;yes. we showed you at investor day that we had a gap to be fully compliant. we're going to be fully compliant by the end of the year. we did close that gap this quarter, not completely, by about one-third. obviously we also disclosed -- on the slide you'll see our hqla, our high quality liquid assets which has a relationship. they've gone up. but that's the numerator and the denominator changes, too. so think about it as we've made good progress. we've closed the gap by about one-third and we're on the way to compliance. and i think, when marianne gave you the forecast going forward for nim, that includes changing how we create more lcr.
2;21;117;2;0.017094017094017096;on the quantitative stuff we passed. and that's why we got the capital plan. there are criticisms around qualitative. and from what we know now, and we're still doing work, we're going to give you more, is around -- they want more granular type of forecasting. they want more idiosyncratic type of forecasting. so we're having conversations with them. marianne has formed a ccar department which is going to become experts in ccar. and, betsy, in terms of the time line, we're resubmitting, as requested, in the third quarter. we're doing everything between now and then to remediate and improve our processes following their feedback. so we're committed to being successful.
2;22;58;0;0.0;yes, so brennan, i think it's very hard to predict. and you're right, it bounces around and it can be noisy. we had a higher level of litigation reserves in the first quarter of last year. and we hope that the numbers will remain low but we can not predict them for you, i'm afraid.
2;23;132;0;0.0;they're always going to be lumpy because we have to deal with these things in due course. i think in the prior years we put away a lot. we've always kept the same, predominantly mortgage, largely mortgage, et cetera. and obviously the fact we're not doing more means we think we've gotten there. we did a lot of work on that. it could always change. but we've done thorough analysis. as a lot of you all did, by the way. we did it at the tranche level almost. so, could it be permanently lower? yes, it could be permanently lower. it does not have to go higher. but, obviously, a lot of things coming our way and we'll have to reserve appropriately as they come in.
2;24;180;0;0.0;yes, it's tough to predict but maybe the thing you could look at is, if you take our pretax spread right now of 100 basis points, that compares to a longer-term average run rate of 65 basis points before the crisis. we've been stepping down from a very high level at the beginning of 2012. and we're back to a level where, frankly, we're not that far away from the longer-term run rate. and it's driven by the primary-secondary spread, which came in about 20 basis points in the quarter, back to levels that, again, feel more normal. i do not know i could say what inning we're in, i'm not a sports person, but it does not feel like we have another big step change to go. but we expect it might be up a little bit next quarter, not down, for a variety of reasons. yes. there's going to be volatility quarter on quarter, but for this year we think we're in and around this range.
2;25;139;3;0.02158273381294964;a lot of that business is -- we call it flow business. so we look at credit, emerging markets, rates, fx. the clients -- we deal with clients all around the world and they need those services. obviously, we always try to become more efficient. so if you look at fx, i'm going to say 80% is electronic. if you look at rates, the electronic number's going to go up. and so we're going to drive efficiency. but we still think clients are going to need it. there will be spreads to pay for it. and, obviously, everyone is going to be adjusting to basel iii. as you pointed out, some people leaving the business, some are getting into the business. we think it has a good future. we do not think it's going to go away.
2;26;214;0;0.0;i think you're confusing two different things. i really think that quality -- they're going to give us more feedback on where they say we fell short in quality. i've mentioned them -- idiosyncratic, more level detail, more enterprise-wide type of forecasting, et cetera. that's one issue. the second is the actual dollar amount. the fed has made it very clear, they want people to get to their basel iii targets. ours is at least 9.5%. ben bernanke said on a speech he gave that the banks that they did the stress tests on have more capital after extreme stress than they started in the crisis. so the fed, i think, is feeling more and more comfortable, not just individual banks but the system as a whole. and we reduced the 15 down to 6 because we wanted to get to our 9.5% target faster. that's why we did it. we just changed our mind. we want to get to 9.5% this year, we want to get to lcr this year. and obviously they may change the stress test next year. and assume we're going to have a conservation buffer coming in. and we do not know how the interplay of those two things will work.
2;27;88;1;0.011363636363636364;i think it's too early. yes, it's too early for us to tell that. remember, that's going to relate to how fast you grow and other requests from regulators. so we'll take that when we get there. yes, but we do -- erika, we do expect that we will be continuing to grow capital just through this 100 basis points of passive runoff from mitigation. certainly our capital levels will be stronger and we're just going to have to see how things play out.
2;28;97;0;0.0;so, if i could -- a little difficult to side it for you. but we did see a lot of still the pull forward to the fourth quarter, just given the year-end issues that people were concerned about. and so that has had an impact. i think it's slightly less of an impact than in terms of the competitive landscape. and there are deals being done with terms and conditions and pricing that we're not comfortable with at the moment, and we're just remaining very disciplined. so that has had an impact for us.
2;29;6;0;0.0;broadly flat. broadly flat, around 32%.
2;30;5;0;0.0;broadly flat at around 32%.
2;31;1;0;0.0;correct.
2;32;3;0;0.0;broadly flat. flat.
2;33;17;0;0.0;actually, we saw declines in deposits. so they're using their cash. they're waiting it out.
2;34;63;0;0.0;mike, it's marianne. we're in constant dialogue with our regulators. and so we know that we should be expecting some more consent orders. but to clarify for you, they relate to issues that we've been working on over the course of the last several years. so these are not new breaking issues that will surprise you in any material way.
2;35;90;0;0.0;mike, we can not really go into the detail of the reports in specifics. but we obviously respect the work of the subcommittee. we respect the findings they had and we're working very hard to fix our issues. as it relates to the proposal and the recommendation to require documentation associated with portfolio hedging, identifying the specific risks that the hedge is designed to mitigate, and then monitoring it over time, we tend to agree that that makes a lot of sense in the context of what we face.
2;36;114;1;0.008771929824561403;no. and actually there's a couple of things i would say. first, that we're organizing ourselves around the control and regulatory agenda because it's a high priority for us. and we're getting ourselves organized in the same way as we would around a merger or an acquisition. and in doing that we are prioritizing our work. but we're not changing our overall strategy. we're not going to change the way we treat our customers, how we think about growing our businesses. but at the margin we're going to refocus our energies on making sure that we execute on the commitments to improve the control and regulatory environments.
2;37;134;2;0.014925373134328358;yes, so applications actually have come back up. rates have come down a little in the second quarter. for us in particular, starting there, we're expecting re-fi volumes to stay high. we did see a little bit of an increase in purchase volumes in the applications in the first quarter, albeit from a smaller base. and also we did the met life transaction so we have the opportunity to be working that portfolio. so our view on volumes for the year is that they're going to remain solid, although there will be some volatility really on the back of continued strength in refinancing. and you saw the harp extension so more broadly for the market i think re-fi including harp will be a level of support for volumes this year.
2;38;59;0;0.0;honestly, it's really all part of how we think about positioning the organization. and being compliant with lcr is part of our new reality. it's just a part of -- we've embedded it into just how we're thinking about the overall positioning of the firm. so it's not something we're separating out for you.
2;39;137;1;0.0072992700729927005;it's hard for me to predict the second quarter. it is a real reduction in risk across the portfolio including -- and not driven by but including -- the synthetic credit portfolio which we continue to derisk. but it is important to note, if you look across the asset classes, there's been a very significant decline in the levels of volatility that affect the time series for our lookback period. so that, necessarily, bad days rolled off and better days rolled on. and so, when we compute our var it's pushing the var down lower. so, as long as volatility remains low and we continue to derisk, there's reasons to believe they'll be at or around this level. but it is going to be subject to changes in volatility, as and when they happen.
2;40;42;0;0.0;it's factored in. yes it's an all-in number for us. so, to the degree we expect that to happen by the year end, it's all part of the number, including some capacities to buy shares, the whole thing.
2;41;101;0;0.0;i'll take the two things separately, the ppnr separate from trading losses. on the trading losses, obviously there's a number of different stresses that we do. and while our number was different, i do not think we feel like there's anything about our processes that is materially going to change. but as it relates to ppnr, we did get feedback that we need to look at certain of our revenue models and we need to look at them more centrally. and, as jamie said, with a slightly more negative view, idiosyncratically. and we're going to do that.
2;42;167;3;0.017964071856287425;so, a couple of things. one is, we are expecting to, and hoping to -- we've set a target for ourselves to gain share -- we do expect volumes to be supported by refinancing this year. that is our expectation. it could change, of course. as it relates to the cost structure, obviously that comes down a little bit more slowly over time but we're making progress. and we talked about the fact that we expect that to be down at $600 million run rate for the fourth quarter. and down to $325 million sometime over the next couple of years. and we're actively working on optimizing our servicing business, both the core performing servicing -- and you saw that obviously with the met life deal -- but also, where it would make sense, we would be open to doing sales on subservicing of delinquent loans. and we're working through all those things to try and get to cost structures to the best place it can be.
2;43;83;0;0.0;the private equity, we've always told you, is lumpy. it was just markdowns and write-downs of existing positions. and we do not go through the specific names. but, obviously, we hope it will earn a profit. it just was not a particularly good quarter for private equity. and the private equity legally can survive volcker and all those things. we like the business. we like the people. and you just have to do it in a different basis, that's all.
2;44;17;0;0.0;no. there's no seasonality in private equity. it's constantly being reviewed. and it's lumpy.
2;45;142;2;0.014084507042253521;absolutely. guy, it's a big change from the fourth quarter, off a small number. so, not to diminish the size of the numbers, but positive $50 million, negative $80 million, plus or minus around the zero level. what that's a factor of, guy, is that the reserve release is based upon our model, and realized losses is based upon agency activity. so the timing is not exactly perfect. so realized losses came down from about $200 million to $180 million. and we did not build reserves. we released them, just not at the same order of magnitude. and it's really to do with timing, which is why we say that we do expect over time they'll net to zero. last quarter it was a small positive. this quarter it's a small negative. nothing to read into it.
2;46;109;4;0.03669724770642202;we're in constant dialogue with the regulators. we obviously can not comment on the specifics of our conversations with them. we've had some very constructive conversations as we came out the 2013 ccar process. and on the basis of those we're actively working to make the improvements they want us to make. but also expecting to continue to get more and more detailed feedback and actually hope to get some industry best practice information, too. so we're going to be working in partnership with them, in constant dialogue, all the way through this year so that we can be clear on what success looks like.
2;47;133;2;0.015037593984962405;we have not gotten a lot of feedback yet. so there will be more to come. but we're going to be geared up to do it. and i think we want to be best-in-class in ccar. the answer is [absolutely positive] in ppnr. i mentioned just one -- idiosyncratic exposure and risk in ppnr. when you go through a stress test, you can assume that your company is just dealing with all those macroeconomic factors with your forecast. you can assume your company is going through those macroeconomic forecasts plus you're under some other kind of stress and you can lose market shares. obviously that would change your ppnr. so we'll be having more dialogue and trying to figure out and make sure we do the right thing here.
2;48;49;2;0.04081632653061224;no. this is just a resubmission of the progress program. and they like to see qualitative improvement. this is not a change of request at all. this is the one that marianne referred to that will be in the third quarter. we'll obviously do another ccar in january.
2;49;131;0;0.0;no. the through-the-year accruals is almost exactly the same. it's based upon -- there's a lot of stuff that goes into that number but that really has not changed that much. yes. and actually you've got to normalize out the dva, which was a large loss last quarter. if we normalize that out, revenues are down. so it's not comped down on revenue. (multiple speakers) i was referring to that we're constantly putting in new operationals, new systems to reduce overhead. marianne already mentioned a bunch of things we're doing in mortgage. you're seeing similar efforts in consumer. that's a constant effort. we do have names for some of them, by the way. i'm just not going to mention them here.
2;50;2;0;0.0;no. no.
2;51;53;1;0.018867924528301886;i think you're referring to the ctl, the commercial term lending, which is lending against multi-family. and we have seen growth in it. remember, that stuff is like 65% ltv. it did great through this last downturn so we're very comfortable with that kind of lending. i forgot where you --.
2;52;7;0;0.0;i would say a little of both.
2;53;68;0;0.0;are you talking about the commercial bank or the total company? we would expect to be flat to down a little bit as companies use their -- they have a lot of deposits. so i think we, at investor day and earlier, told people they were really high and we expected it to come down, particularly before people start using their revolvers. so they do relate to each other.
2;54;8;0;0.0;i do not know the answer to that.
2;55;152;0;0.0;we did a whole page for you on where we thought the through-the-cycle reserve levels should be by business. and there are some businesses -- mortgage, most obviously -- that still have a way to go. and there are other businesses in the wholesale space, in the commercial bank, that are below that through the cycle. i would refer you back to that page. if you do the numbers, from recollection, on an annualized basis, our charge-offs have been more like $7 billion or $8 billion, which, while that is not dissimilar to charge-offs we've seen, it's for different reasons. so i would take a look at that page. it's mostly mortgage that will come down. think of everything else as close to normal. mortgage, which in total is $9 billion, will eventually be a lot lower than that. but that could take a couple of years.
2;56;138;5;0.036231884057971016;to talk for us specifically, as you probably know, we've been very successful and proactive as it's relating to harping our own book. and by the end of this year we fully expected to have been as successful and mine that as far as possible, or they will carry on. that's not the case in the industry. so it's great news that harp was extended out to the end of 2015. and it will allow for other servicers to get their ducks in a row and potentially to have cross service to harp. which, in turn, should be good in terms of volumes, although i do not think it will be a step change. for us we're not expecting it to be a significant difference in our production or in our msr value.
2;57;181;4;0.022099447513812154;we talked about we peaked in our harp volumes in about second quarter of last year. i think overall, first half of last year was high, came down slightly, overall 15% last year. we talked at investor day that we thought that would go down to the high single digits this year, and it is, in terms of percentage of our production. and we are very active and have been very proactive in mailing our harp population. and expected to have completed the program by the end of the year. so we were on track and this does not change our expectations. i think the total -- if you take all mortgages, i think the number's like 4 million would be harp-able today if they went to it. i'm somewhat surprised that more people do not do it, to tell you the truth. anything the government can do, either pr, i think the cross-servicing is probably a bigger one, will make it slightly better. the thing was just slightly better. it's not going to dramatically change mortgage.
2;58;11;0;0.0;we hope so. we do not know any better than you.
2;59;16;0;0.0;you really have to ask them. we'll leave this to them and the regulators, okay?
2;60;6;0;0.0;you've got to ask them.
3;1;53;0;0.0;hello, john. . so we do not disclose the bank leverage ratio. but it is lower than the holding company, so we would have a further way to go. as we said, we intend to be compliant at the holding company level by the beginning of 2015 and work on bank compliance shortly thereafter.
3;2;73;0;0.0;john, obviously the rules are fairly new, and still a proposal and not final. so there's work to do before they get finalized. we're working through all of the things we'd need to do to comply. i would say we would aim to be compliant by the end of 2015, but we need to go do more detailed plans and we'll get back to you with some more specifics.
3;3;12;0;0.0;yes, all of those things could be considered and would be considered.
3;4;89;1;0.011235955056179775;so in terms of the cushion, while it's not scientific, there is a volatility in that number inherent in actually deposit flows. so we do see some things in deposit flows, particularly wholesale flows, and that could span a quarter end and drive the ratio up or down some. so it's prudent to run at a ratio above 100% and around about this level. and just in terms of acceleration, we just wanted to get there more quickly. the opportunity presented itself, so nothing more than that.
3;5;128;3;0.0234375;so it's a great question, john, because as you alluded to in the question, there's a large number of moving parts in terms of the forecast, including points of yield on rates, which as you know have been choppy over the last several weeks. so we base our projections on modest loan growth and on our understanding of the implied rate curves and that they could all -- they could change. also deposit flows, as you've seen, have been very, very strong. so we accelerated our lcr compliance back to the majority of the nim compression we were previously expecting and guiding you to forward SEMICOLON and consequently, we expect to be more stable, with some loan yield compression being offset by lower cost of debt.
3;6;191;0;0.0;i'll just give you two data points, and then you can maybe go and have a look at them. but i think in the q, we disclose a couple of things. the first is a bit of a sweetener which says that over 12 months, it would deliver about $900 million of additional nii. it's not exactly what we've seen, but-- that's the 10-year going up 100 basis points. that's right. that's the 10-year going up 100 basis points. i'm sorry. and that's not exactly what we've seen, but it's the closest thing to what we're seeing right now. and then the other thing we've disclosed is on a parallel shift of 100 basis points, so if your short rates go up 2%, that would deliver just over $2 billion over 12 months. and not to say that recurs, but it takes time to build up to that. and that's interest rates only, not mortgage volume, investment banking volume. that's just isolating interest rates only, assuming the company invests the way we're planning to.
3;7;16;0;0.0;those were the numbers from the last q, and they are not meaningfully changed right now.
3;8;200;1;0.005;yes. so john, i would point you to -- and i can not remember the page, i apologize -- but we put a page in investor day that talked about what we thought through the cycle charge-off rates were for each of our businesses. and so what i would do is look at -- take nci loans and a reserve balance at the end of the period of $3.3 billion, take a look at that page and figure out what a more normal sort of charge-off rate, and therefore reserve balance, would be. and that will be in large part a reduction over the course of the next several quarters. so we expect it to be a journey to get to that level throughout 2014. and wholesale, we're kind of where we should be. we should not expect much different. credit card, maybe a little bit more, but put that in the hundreds of millions. yes. and on mortgage, i think we said investment day, eventually it will be $1 billion to $1.5 billion, within a couple years. and pci, if we have home improvement, we may see some reduction in pci loan loss reserves. purchase credit (inaudible).
3;9;34;0;0.0;no, we have not done that yet, john. but the reserve release we took at nci was driven in large part by lower severity. so if this continues, you might see some of that.
3;10;0;0;NA; .
3;11;172;5;0.029069767441860465;yes. so brennan, what we laid on the page was an illustration. and you're absolutely right. what it shows you is that we want to be able to close that gap much more quickly, and so that might very well be what happens. we just are not coming out now with a target of achieving it over the course of the next one or two quarters, because we have other objectives, including the continuation of being able to have some capital distributions to you guys that we want to be able to decide when we do ccar at the end of the year. we'll be able to do it pretty quickly when we know what it actually is. we do not want to start making actions that affect customers way in advance of knowing the real final rules. right. but what you took away from the page was absolutely right. closing that gap should not be difficult and could be more quick than this, but we wanted to be cautious.
3;12;55;1;0.01818181818181818;yes. so we're not going to disclose the duration, but there was some changes in the portfolio as we moved out of non-eligible into eligible securities for lcr and also maintained more cash. so there were some changes. we also, as you saw, are making gains on sale and we were doing that.
3;13;46;0;0.0;no. no. remember, when rates go up, certain mortgages lengthen and a whole bunch of different things take place. but in general, the portfolio is several year duration, a couple years duration, aa-plus SEMICOLON and obviously, it changes over time to manage into short exposures.
3;14;16;0;0.0;that's not a bad assumption. all things being equal. all things being equal, yes. (laughter).
3;15;1;0;0.0;exactly.
3;16;131;1;0.007633587786259542;the board -- we're not going to tell you what board deliberations are. but the board obviously has talked to shareholders, a bunch of ideas. and also, we think we have some of the best corporate governance out there, including -- which i think is more important than the separation of chairman and ceo -- that the board should make the decision based on the circumstance of the time. they know the company, the strategy, the people, that the board always meets without the ceo, the board in total sets the agenda, the board is completely engaged in ceo compensation, the board can hire and fire the ceo at will. and those practices, some are in our charters, some are not. but hopefully, it will not be the distraction it was last year.
3;17;2;0;0.0; . hello, betsy.
3;18;141;3;0.02127659574468085;so betsy, there's nothing underlying it. let me just give you, hopefully, enough. it is a little bit lower than $4.7 million. and given that the ratio for the bank holding company is 6%, then the gap is a little bit bigger. but measured in small terms of basis points, not more. and a lot of it's historical, how jpmorgan chase got built through mergers over time, what ended up in the bank, what ended up in broker dealers. and we'll have to change our legal entities a little bit overseas. so we'll have to modify our legal entities to accomplish our the objectives, and we'll be able to do that over time. and over time, if we're able to push out, it will help. exactly. and remember, the overriding constraint is the 5%.
3;19;3;0;0.0;yes, of course.
3;20;1;0;0.0;yes.
3;21;224;0;0.0;we're not going to disclose it today, betsy, and we can reconsider that, because we think there is some pretty fundamental issues with some of those proposals, not least of which is the absence of fin-41 netting or netting on match securities financing, which we believe and are hopeful is going to be resolved. but it is a add-on and it's not insignificant. and the thing that i stress in derivative receivables but not taking benefit for collateral, which we know we get. and there are a lot of issues in there that need to be looked at and analyzed. betsy, to brennan's earlier question, i think in the context of what we've laid out as illustratively being achievable, then timelines would solve the problem. the other important point is one of the things that basel and all this stuff is supposed to do is harmonize global rules. this is clearly no longer harmonization, where we have one part of the world is talking about two times, with another part of the world is talking about. and i do not think there's any industry out there that would be comfortable with something like that in the long run. because in the long run, that has a lot of effects that you can not determine, quarter-by-quarter.
3;22;1;0;0.0;right.
3;23;49;3;0.061224489795918366;the hpi improvement on rwa has a bit of a lag to it. so while it did contribute to the reduction in our rwa, our reduction was principally run-off, and some model enhancement and some lower risk. but in part, that lower risk was driven by better hci.
3;24;17;1;0.058823529411764705;yes, betsy, it's a great question. and we will get back to you after the call.
3;25;2;0;0.0;hello, matt.
3;26;100;3;0.03;so you know, june was a bit more challenging, and so it was not as strong as april and may. but it really comes down to the fact that we really do have a client driven business model. and the client flows, they held up. and so if you surround that with robust and strong trading risk discipline, that's pretty much how it turned out. and i think our folks in emerging markets also did a spectacularly good job, because i think you might see some real differentiation there from some other folks when all their numbers come out.
3;27;4;0;0.0;a little of everything.
3;28;50;0;0.0;i think we've been very consistent in how we look at comp and how we accrue it and things like that, after capital charges and by line of business, type of business and such, that it's just a change of mix and a change of capital, et cetera.
3;29;1;0;0.0;yes.
3;30;1;0;0.0;possibly.
3;31;0;0;NA; .
3;32;21;0;0.0;mike, all other things being equal, that's not an unreasonable assumption. but as we said before, things are never equal.
3;33;7;0;0.0;i'm sorry, mike, say that again?
3;34;16;0;0.0;yes, i guess that's about right. or maybe a little less. a little less, mike.
3;35;71;0;0.0;yes, i think we disclose all of the assumptions in the earnings risk tables in the 10-q. but yes, it's short rates staying low and the 10-year going up 100 basis points, i think. yes, but it also drags up the five-year, the seven-year. yes. yes. so if you use one point, it's the 10-year. but it's the yield curve going up steeply.
3;36;27;0;0.0;you're not mistaken, which is why if you actually get more of a parallel shift and short rates go up, our numbers go up by multiples.
3;37;66;1;0.015151515151515152;the pipeline? activity levels picked up some, and we expect that to carry into the third quarter. so a little better. and you saw a real slowdown when we had the volatile markets in june, but we think that's not permanent, the markets kind of open up again. you've seen a bunch of ipos and debt deals and a lot of m&a chatter.
3;38;59;0;0.0;we did not disclose that, mike, for a couple of reasons. one is that, as we said, the proposals, we think, have some fundamental issues to them. but it would be lower. the gross up to our balance sheet on top of the 3.5% sitting on the page would not be insignificant, but we did not disclose it.
3;39;41;0;0.0;yes, that is definitely one of the reasons. and that's one of the reasons why we said, of course, the timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules, and that would be one of those changes.
3;40;104;2;0.019230769230769232;first of all, i think it's going great. and the folks in the field will tell you that they are seeing huge benefits from putting together the corporate global investment bank, the corporate investment bank, treasury services. but you are right. there's been flattening out a little bit in treasury services and investor services, which is mostly custody. some of that's spread, some of that's margins. so some of that will benefit also a little bit from rising rates. and we do not know what the peers will show yet. so maybe you do, but i do not know yet.
3;41;20;0;0.0;mike, i do not know. and obviously, if we lag our peers, we'll be as disappointed as you are.
3;42;53;0;0.0;your last one. yes, it's balancing both, erika, which is why, in response to the earlier question, we said we've been conservative on the timeline, because we want to reserve the flexibility to consider capital distributions when we do our ccar in 2013, and it will be a factor we consider.
3;43;45;1;0.022222222222222223;so erika, the truly truly variable, as in transaction variable proportion of the business, is some. but the majority of it is related to people and systems, so there's usually a several month lag to be able to get that out of the system.
3;44;79;0;0.0;i think, think about it this way. i think that revenue margins will be down on competitive pressures, volumes are down, and expenses may go up because volumes are down, for a couple of quarters. sorry, expense margins would up. in other words, a dramatic reduction in profits. we're trying to be clear with you that this would be a significant event, if rates stay where they are, if mortgage rates stay where they are, or go higher.
3;45;168;1;0.005952380952380952;yes, so let me just walk you through it. so this quarter, our expenses adjusted for litigation were $15.2 billion. for the first half, adjusted for corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters, it was $30.7 billion, which would be against the $59 billion target, which is running a little high. but there are two important factors. one is in our definition of adjustment, we only adjusted out corporate litigation, so there's other litigation in the firm that's several hundred million dollars. it's disclosed in our supplement. you can see that. and also in the first half of the year, we did see out performance in terms of the investment bank, or cib, revenues. and clearly, we pay compensation on that, which is a it good expense and we would waive it in all day long. so if you take the combination of those two things that we do not technically adjust out, our underlying core expenses are on track for that number, yes.
3;46;34;0;0.0;you can not really think about a run rate trend in litigation costs, because they are somewhat lumpy. so we do not have a forecast for you, and they will go up and down.
3;47;147;2;0.013605442176870748;you're absolutely right. when you separate nim, you try to tease it out and you make our interest rates. because you've got to look at the underlying results, underlying volumes and things like that. there's no reason to think that we are not going to have a good trading going forward, because if the economy is strengthening, and we believe, our view is that it is, and that capital markets are going to open up again, and people get adjusted to slightly new, higher rates. and yes, volatility helps certain trading areas. higher interest rates hurt mortgages, but again, they can help other areas. so it's a whole potpourri. it's impossible almost to separate it out. and we try to do that for you, but i think it's a little bit of a mistake when you look at the hold company.
3;48;132;3;0.022727272727272728;so we are working really hard on the ccar resubmission. and you're right, we're going to resubmit that before the end of the third quarter. we're in constant dialogue with the regulators, although we will not receive any formal feedback until we're in the fourth quarter. and so we're doing everything we can to be able to be successful in remediating any of the issues they identify for us. and if we're able to do that, then there should be no impact. it will not be for lack of trying. yes, it will not be for the number of people who are -- you have probably a thousand people now who are devoted-- we have 500 people that are dedicated and thousands of people working on it.
3;49;155;0;0.0;so just a point of clarification, if it was not clear, is that our guidance is that we're expecting to get our expenses down to $600 million in the fourth quarter from the level they're at now, which is $715 million for this quarter. so just to be very clear. and to remind you, our longer term run rate for that business is $325 million a quarter. so it is dominated by the default side, but there is some core performance obviously in there, too. and to keep it really simple, we hope to get it to a run rate of $500 million the year after that, $400 million the year after that, and $325 million the year after, where we should be. and we have a lot of work to do in systems, et cetera to get all that done. and obviously the costly foreclosure, the legal stuff, is also coming down.
3;50;53;1;0.018867924528301886;three-year. three years. and know that we're actively working the portfolio to be able to do what we can more quickly, so you would expect that we're looking at either sales or sub servicing of defaulted loans and capacatizing our performing servicing. so we're working on all of that.
3;51;90;0;0.0;sure. they're all calculated the same way, based upon the disclosed closed loan volumes that we have to use. so if you take the revenues and expenses and use the closed loans volumes for the quarter, that's how we derive the margins, which is why you see some short-term noise quarter over quarter and the increase this quarter to actually 116 basis points, because we actually book revenues when we lock loans, but we report them closed. which is different than you guys do it at wells.
3;52;80;2;0.025;yes. so i would tell you that it's more of what we're seeing and feeling in discussions and activity with our clients, that we feel like deal activity levels have picked up and may be turning. and the pipeline feels a little better and solid, but not strong. so we're expecting that to translate into the second half. and obviously, as the economy continues to recover and confidence continues to grow, hopefully that will get even better.
3;53;57;0;0.0;so i mean, listen, my comment on that is that glass steagall did not have anything to do with the crisis, and our business model allowed us to be a port in the storm. our customers like doing business with us in the model that we have now, so -- we do not spend time thinking about that.
3;54;56;0;0.0;yes. so gerard, just to be really clear, and you look at the title there, to be illustrative, we just, for the purposes of this analysis, we just hold everything flat. that's not to imply anything about what our capital distributions will be going forward, but rather to imply we can continue to do some.
3;55;13;0;0.0;yes, i mean it's just optimizing our mix between common and preferreds.
3;56;13;0;0.0;it's too early for us to talk about passes on that level.
3;57;89;0;0.0;i think, folks, this just came out. so we're trying to share information with you. and it might, but give us a little bit of time and we'll give you a deeper feel how it might affect -- how this might affect different businesses, different products. because obviously when you do something like this, this will be pushed down, at one point, not just to the line of business, but to the client and the product and the country, and then we can answer that question for you.
3;58;54;1;0.018518518518518517;nothing in particular, just demand. and i should temper that with, just demand and the continuation that we've talked about of very, very strong competition. and we are, as i said, we are prioritizing quality over growth. we would tactically under perform rather than chase a deal that we were not comfortable with.
3;59;11;0;0.0;the results are in our second quarter results. not that material.
3;60;8;0;0.0;you should probably ask them. we hope so.
3;61;58;2;0.034482758620689655;we're not going to give you monthly specific. i think our folks did a very good job in june. obviously, when spreads widen out, certain businesses are more of this than others. i already mentioned that emerging markets replies to the most volatility, both in terms of spreads volatility and equity markets, did a very good job.
3;62;123;2;0.016260162601626018;so you should think about mortgage as having some more releases, because we continue to see delinquencies and severities improve, particularly hpi improvement. and so you should expect that to continue, maybe not at the level that we saw this quarter, because we had a big revision to hpi, as you know, during the last several months. and in part, we've had $1.050 billion of reserve releases in the first half. given what we're seeing, we expect more releases in the second half, but not at that level. think of the several hundred million. several hundred million dollars. it's near the end, the car. and wholesale is kind of where it should be and will bounce around. thank you.
3;63;49;0;0.0;you got it exactly right. at investor day, we gave you something that was far more dramatic than 100 basis points, and we already said the duration of this thing is not 10 years, it's a lot less than 10 years. so obviously, the effect will be less.
3;64;4;0;0.0;not really. not really.
3;65;214;1;0.004672897196261682;so the investor day scenario was a more severe scenario than the 230 basis points you're implying. what was the number we gave at investor day? it was 300 basis, plus or minus. and this is in line with our expectations. unfortunately, oci is not, i hate to say, is not that big a deal. we all know about it. we're all prepared for it. rates can go up. oci gains are going to go down. 20 basis points, you're going to see this happen elsewhere. it's asynchronous. we have oci going through capital and the benefits going through earnings in the future. so if it were up to us, we would not have actually had this asynchronous accounting to this thing. and we're prepared, we're going to have buffers that could compare that. we know how a conservation buffer works, but it's not that big a deal. the duration of our portfolio, and you guys can do it yourself, aa-plus, couple your duration, you could almost calculate the number yourself. with one caveat is that the losses are less as rates go up, because of the complexity of the portfolio, currently. and the other thing about this, we can change it overnight at any time.
3;66;100;0;0.0;if you move a trade to a central clearinghouse, it has no charge here and it has nothing to do with the margin that they put up with the clearinghouse. the trade is bilateral with us. you have the receivable get stressed, and you can not take the benefit of the fact that you're going to get collateral against it. that's the way the calculations are done. so any trade you move to a clearing house eliminates that exposure. the margin of the clients with the clearing house is not with us. it's with the clearing house.
3;67;121;1;0.008264462809917356;we've already added in our forecast to you guys some moving derivatives, on liquid cap and all that. i do think at the margins this will support things in the clearing houses. but we do not have analysis to tell you about that right now. will it be material? we do not really know yet. remember, the clients, there's a lot of client business who, they are also going to determine what they want. it will not be just up to us. and remember that the derivative add-on calculation is a calculation that is currently being rethought by the basel committee because of some of the issues with it. so it could also, in and of itself, improve.
3;68;185;0;0.0;we have not done that analysis. it's hard to tell. to be honest, we were trying to be very transparent and give you some ideas about the sorts of things that we're considering. we have not translated these into detailed plans yet, so we do not know the second order impacts of this yet. i think marianne gave numbers to show that we can handle this. but also, you have to be very cognizant of client effects. we have a client business, and we have to make sure that we continue to have a client franchise. and so over time, we'll adjust the businesses, and we'll meet lcr, we'll meet basel iii, we're going to meet whatever the leverage ratio is. and think of it in some ways of alternative minimum taxes. so if every client will be running what's your return on basel iii capital and then what's your return on leverage capital? stress capital. and stress capital. so you'll try to manage all those as fair to the client and fair to the company.
3;69;100;3;0.03;obviously, we can do stuff like that. yes. give us a little time. we're showing you that we can get to the consolidated pretty easily, maybe have to restructure some things and change the capital structure a little bit, and move businesses out of the fdic-insured bank and all that. i just do not think any of that's going to be critical to the future function of our business. we'll adjust those things to accomplish what we need to accomplish. and give us a little more time. it just happened a couple days ago. thank you.
3;70;302;0;0.0;well, let me take do the first question -- second question first. if you have a world where some businesses have to hold twice as much capital as other companies, that obviously over time can create huge competitive disadvantages. i do not know of any industry in america who would want to compete globally in that basis. we have an interest in a safe and sound system, so not against the leverage ratio. but we would be, we're not for a hugely unbalanced competitive playing field. so put that aside. the regulators know that. they are trying to -- we thought part of basel and all that is to harmonize these kind of things. and if you ask about it, what we show here, and marianne just shows, anything which is a low rwa asset, including hqla, revolvers, certain types of derivatives, those things obviously you'll look at a little bit differently because it's a leverage ratio asset. and we do not have to do it by business yet. we'll give you more detail later. like even marianne had mentioned that we take huge deposits in from countries and from money funds, et cetera, that you may not take in, because you can not afford capital against a deposit of $1 billion dollars you get from a money fund that you park with the fed for 25 basis points, you pay the fdic 10 basis points, you pay the client 5 or 6 or 7 basis points, you got to put 6% capital against it. you simply stop doing -- there are a whole bunch of things we've got to figure out how we're going to do it. but we want to make sure we manage the client franchise properly. we'll figure out the other stuff over time.
3;71;55;0;0.0;so separate the type of deposit, okay? so if it's a consumer deposit, it has a completely different lcr, how you can invest, the kind of spread you can make. if it's what we call big wholesale short-term deposits, you're absolutely correct. we would probably restrict some of that over time.
3;72;116;1;0.008620689655172414;yes. this back up, although sharp, is not entirely unexpected. so as we talk about our longer term plans, and when we outlined all of that and the strategy for the mortgage business at investor day, that medium to long-term plan does not change. so it may accelerate some of the activities that we have and have, as we said, some impact on the next couple of quarters' results. but the long-term strategy has not changed. we're working the portfolio, optimizing servicing, trying to take costs out as quickly as possible and grow share. and actually, we think we should be able to grow share even more strongly in a more difficult market.
3;73;32;0;0.0;no. no, nancy. not yet. not yet. and as you know, traditionally that would, in any case, lag. of course, that does not mean it will, but that's traditionally what happens.
3;74;158;0;0.0;this is what the issue is with all this, you spend all your time talking about accounting, as opposed to business. the business is deposits, serving clients, doing things. and now we talk all the time about aoci. and we have a lot of asynchronous accounting, and pro cyclical accounting and stuff like that, that we try to explain. but we try to look through all of that and build a business, more clients, more bankers, more branches, happier clients. so in all of our business, that's how we look at it. we'll work through the asynchronous accounting. if the loan loss reserve accounting changes, it would add, obviously the loan losses, though probably not as much as people think. but we still would run the business for economics in the long run. it would not change how we run the business. we would be just be holding more reserves, which would be fine with us.
3;75;74;0;0.0;well, as you know, the industry commented, we commented in terms of the proposal. and we are generally in favor of it, but i think that a lifetime timeline is too long, so something shorter than that would make sense. i think we need to work that through. it would be implemented over, not the course of the next couple of quarters, but in a year or so. so we'll wait and see.
3;76;78;1;0.01282051282051282;i would say, so first of all, the industry groups have not fully reforecast the market, so we'll wait and see what they come out with. we're trying to be transparent with our guidance, so that level, hopefully we're wrong and hopefully it will be better than that. i will say, for our own business, we did not expect volumes to be down this much throughout the year, had this not happened with this space.
3;77;30;0;0.0;well, mostly this is refi. so purchase, we actually saw go up a little bit. they're not going to make up for refi. but they may go up, yes.
3;78;82;3;0.036585365853658534;look, we're in favor of finishing. we've always believed in high capital, high liquidity, good regulation and things like that, and finishing it. and obviously, there are things that all countries have points of view about which would be different. but i think the better you get to real harmonization -- the closer you get to real harmonization, the better. if you want to start all over again, we'll spend another five years debating every single thing out there. yes.
3;79;1;0;0.0;yes.
3;80;61;1;0.01639344262295082;well, as i said, we're expecting nims to stay broadly flat from here. we do expect some modest loan growth, that's our outlook. i'm not going to tell you how much, but some. and then we also have the improving cost of debt, lower cost of debt on actions that we've been taking throughout the first half.
3;81;26;0;0.0;yes. but we also have the yield compression. so you know, there's puts and takes. and so relatively flat on nim, modestly up on nii.
3;82;7;0;0.0;i'm sorry, i did not understand.
3;83;1;0;0.0;yes.
3;84;92;0;0.0;we're growing loans in asset management. we're growing loans in auto. we're adding more mortgage loans. we're expecting some growth in commercial. our commercial real estate is already growing strongly. we're expecting some growth in middle market and corporate client banking space. although we've seen loan reduction in cib, we're expecting that to remain relatively flat. so all other things being equal, that's net growth. and card, as i said, have hit that inflection point, so that will stop contributing to run-off, net.
3;85;56;0;0.0;so our annual guidance was that, if you look at the first half of the year, you'll see that obviously already we're down year-to-date by more than that amount. so this is relative to the third quarter, we expect nii to go up. we're already down a little more than 1%.
3;86;259;3;0.011583011583011582;well, thank you for bragging on our trading results. and for years, the investment bank is building fx rates, securitized products, commodities, emerging markets, credit. and they're good. and obviously, some go up and some go down. i would not say it was-- at least, i did not see any regional effects. we trade around the world and the books get handed off around the world, so it's hard to give it a region. but we build a lot of clients low businesses and that what's driving it. i think it's better for the world to have harmonized rules around what basel is trying to do, et cetera. but you're absolutely correct. it does not have to be exactly the same to have a competitive marketplace, et cetera. we always ran with higher capital liquidity than most of our competitors. i just think if one is 3% and one is 6%, that becomes just too big, and over time it could have huge competitive effects. and the regulators are working it out. we all want a fair, safe, sound financial system, okay? so that's in everyone's benefit, and there are huge capital issues -- capital requirements, liquidity requirements, leverage requirements, stress testing requirements. and among all of that, i feel that we're getting there. but at one point, this should be somewhat harmonized. and your middle two questions, i now forgot. can we get back to you on some of that stuff? we're sort of running out of time rapidly. okay.
3;87;23;1;0.043478260869565216;yes, correct. i'm sorry, david. as of june 30, based upon the us proposed rules. estimated to the best of our ability.
3;88;208;0;0.0;so, david, we did say at the beginning that we do think that having a leverage ratio is an important part of our capital management toolkit or process, as long as it's properly calibrated. and so for us the two questions, i think they are very important and the industry does, too. so we're participating in discussions. as jamie's talked about, what should the quotient, or the ratio, be and making sure that that not only is appropriate but fair across the globe, and also what should the calculation for the denominator be. and we've alluded already to two specific questions, but there are more. one is should high quality liquid assets, most particularly cash and cash at central banks, be treated the same as other balance sheet items? and then in terms of some of the additional add-ons that are being proposed, we think they could have issues, actual issues, for the operation of the financing market. so i think there's going to be a lot of work that takes place. there are comments due back on all of those proposals by mid-september, call it, plus or minus. and i think this will be worked through through the fourth quarter.
4;1;56;0;0.0;i think it may be a little bit the dc shutdown, but in reality, it's a complex thing. it's a board level issue and we want a fair and reasonable settlement, if we can. and that's all we can really say about it. it involves multiple agencies, so you can imagine the complexity.
4;2;32;1;0.03125;no, john. unfortunately, we did as much as we can, give you as much clarity as we can, but we are not going to be able to break that down for you.
4;3;127;0;0.0;yes, so john, the way to think about it, very candidly, is that we did not expect when we estimated that -- remember it's a very difficult thing to estimate, there's significant uncertainty in terms of the estimate, significant judgment. and when we made those judgments in the second quarter, we did not anticipate the environment being as volatile and escalating to the point that it has now. so as we have taken our reserves, and the reserves reflect today, so it reflects the current environment and the situation in fact that we're in, and we've now taken that into consideration as we look forward with our reasonably possible range. that's why it has not gone down anywhere near dollar to dollar, obviously.
4;4;41;0;0.0;all we can say, john, is that we reserve for what's equitable, based on the facts and circumstances specific to each individual exposure, and the overall environment. it's a tough environment, john. we're just trying to reflect that.
4;5;113;2;0.017699115044247787;so just two things, john, and i think in the barclays presentation there was a slide that showed that of the increase in our outlook, there was a chunk of it that related to non-core prep litigation, so it certainly is not entirely to do with our investment in cost and control, much of which we are funding through efficiencies. having said that, there is an incremental cost. it is in part permanent, and it's going to be reflected in our run rate, but there was a good, i think $500 million is my recollection of other expenses including non-corporate litigation, which as you know, we do not adjust out.
4;6;91;0;0.0;yes, so the longer term target was a $325 million quarterly run rate, but that's over the longer term. what we said about 2013 and are on track to deliver is that we would exit the year with about $600 million of expenses in the fourth quarter. which we still expect. yes. which is expected. so if you look at the third quarter run rate adjusted, it's about $650 million, down from just over $700 million in the second quarter, so that trend is moving in the right direction.
4;7;117;0;0.0;so first of all, we're going to get there when we get there, but obviously, this company is very sound, plenty of capital. we want to pass ccar, but when you talk about capital plans, it's going to be subject to several things. one is the stock price, subject to passing ccar with flying colors, which is really the stress test of ccar, and also subject to wanting to meet our own targets for capital. so we've already said we want to get probably something north of 10% basel iii tier 1 capital, et cetera and when we know all those numbers, do our budgets, we'll put the proper ccar plan in place.
4;8;123;0;0.0;i was pointing out mainly, glenn, because i think if you go back several quarters over a year ago, standardized for us was lower than advanced by a reasonable spread, and clearly, when the common [store] amendment is applicable, which is not for a period of time, we would be looking at the lower of those two ratios. right now, it's higher than the advanced approach, by a little more than 10 basis points. we should put out when we do ccar next year, effectively, it's not the same for every quarter, but effectively, it will be based on basel iii, which is a former volatile number because rwa moves around under stress under basel iii, as opposed under basel i.
4;9;1;0;0.0;yes.
4;10;196;4;0.02040816326530612;yes, so slr, which i think you're referring to is 4.7%, remember that would go up by 50 basis points if you just subtracted the cash we hold at central banks. so until final rules come out i would not overreact to it. obviously slr, it causes you to optimize differently, and a lot of products which are very high user capital under slr, think of those as deposits, repo, and any of the short-term and low margin, revolvers et cetera. so it will make you optimize differently, but i think in reality the way we look at it is, we'll be able to adjust to it, we'll probably be able to do it by client. we're going to get to the ratio we need to get to, and we want to do it without disrupting all of our clients. so we will be able to give you more detail when we know the final roles. and remember, glenn, there is still the possibility there will be changes made to reflect i think the fin41, which you're talking about, which i think would be positive for the repo market.
4;11;4;0;0.0;so on nii, glenn?
4;12;55;1;0.01818181818181818;so yes, i mean, growth has flattened out in terms of interest earning assets, you seen that obviously take place over the last couple of quarters, and so our guidance is reflecting the fact that we have seen things stabilize, both nim and nii, and that further near term that's what we're expecting.
4;13;57;1;0.017543859649122806;listen, it's your job to forecast the future. we do think that it's very good businesses, and like i said, it's underlying growth, but obviously it could be swamped in the short run by markets and events, et cetera. we'll provide a lot more in investor day, and give you much more insight.
4;14;102;0;0.0;so, i think there's two major things. first of all, the pre trade and post trade rules are in place, and basically they did not have that much of effect on the business. and now you have the steps in place, and from talking to folks on the trading floor, volumes seem to be down a little bit, but not because of the steps. the steps are basically accepting data at this point. they are not effectively making mortgage yet, so you have not seen a huge effect of it. and i think over time, it still remains to be seen.
4;15;258;2;0.007751937984496124;yes, because we'll meet the new targets and retain the capital, and eventually, we are actually already pushing down to the business. we're sorting to push down to the business units slr, all the capital, all the stuff. eventually, i mean lcr, eventually we'll put down slr, and that will affect pricing and stuff. what we do not want to do is do a lot of anticipation, but if revolvers stay at slr at 100% drawn, the cost will go up. i'm not sure they will go up immediately but they will go up over time so we'll be able to get there. we just do not want to do stupid things in anticipation of rules, which we do not know what they are yet. betsy, our businesses are thinking through all of the implications. when the rules come out, we'll be able to act, but think about it as a measured approach. we do not want to overreact. we want to see how things play out, and at the margin, there will be changes to products and pricing but we'll be very measured. so cash at central banks does not have to hold capital against, that's 50 basis points. if you took revolvers down to what we say is a normal draw, like even a stress draw of 20% which is what we saw in the crisis, there will be another 50 basis points, so we just want to be a little measured in how we deal with this.
4;16;45;0;0.0;no, betsy, this is really just the basic underlying run rate, which is about $650 million. which does include some severance obviously, given actions taken to adjust capacity in the business, together with the $200 million item, which relates to foreclosure, it's nothing else.
4;17;13;0;0.0;no, not anything of any significance. we have done some, but nothing major.
4;18;148;1;0.006756756756756757;we would love to reduce the uncertainty around this for ourselves and for you, but it's very hard to do. so the way i'd look at it is it will probably be elevated for the next year or two, not like we just went through, but it will necessarily be lumpy. so it might be as we settle, as we negotiate, as we figure out -- remember there are multiple agencies involved in every case now, so you saw in the cio that we paid four, maybe eventually five penalties, which we really did not expect. so we just have to deal with it and deal with the reality that it is. it will abate over time, and the underlying power of the company you can see, so-- i wish i could give you a better answer, but one day, it will not be a big number.
4;19;112;1;0.008928571428571428;well, i think you have to look at first of all, the big ones are really board-level type of discussions and we -- our preference is always to resolve it. it is very hard to fight with your regulators or the federal government, but we want them to be fair and reasonable. we have shareholders, and those shareholders, by the way, i remind people, it's not me. it's veterans or retirees and mothers and we're trying to do the right thing. it's very hard. we've got the top people involved inside and outside the company, and hopefully over time, we will make this a much smaller issue.
4;20;184;8;0.043478260869565216;well it does, but again, we think we've maintained pretty good margins and pretty good capital, and we have different ways to optimize. and not all of the things we're simplifying were very profitable, and so remember, let's just focus on other things and the other things we're doing pretty well. like almost every single business, we're up in share. and remember, the reason you go up in share is because you're doing a good job for clients. they vote with their feet, which means you're satisfying them. so we're comfortable we'll be able to adjust to the new world and still have great businesses, and again, you have not seen all of the repricing that might take place, you have not seen the reactions and change in business strategies, and some things may move to the shadow banking world, which is fine. we'll figure it out. like i mentioned, the needs of our clients, consumer, small business, middle market, large corporate, are not going away. they have to be served and satisfied somewhere.
4;21;35;0;0.0;we've said 30% to 35%, and remember we do it pretty consistently after capital, and looking at value created, stuff like that so that has not changed, just came down a little this quarter.
4;22;23;0;0.0;we said there were modest loss last year (multiple speakers) and they were about breakeven this quarter, and it's getting very small.
4;23;152;0;0.0;erica, two things. one is, if you just look at the firm wide leverage ratio for a second that 4.7%, obviously that maybe changes when the final rules are issued, but just take that as a base. we're only 30 basis points from the minimum and while we're targeting to go higher than that, clearly 30 basis points is not a great distance for us to cover. and then i'd just reiterate what jamie said, which is when we look at our 2014 ccar, it will take into account a balanced set of facts and circumstances, so obviously both the quantitative and qualitative nature of the results of the stress test, but also our desire to want to get to capital levels that we've expressed, together with maintaining flexibility to do appropriate dividends and repurchases. so all those things together will be considered in the capital plan.
4;24;149;0;0.0;so three things, just to clarify. currently our standardized ratio is higher than advanced, albeit not by very wide margin, so just to clarify that point. just generically, the advanced approach rwa sensitivity to a stress environment would be more impacted than a standardized approach, but remember, that's a 2014, that's a future issue for us. the 2014 ccar, as we understand the instructions, we will be looking at an additional test on top of the 5% basel i, that will have a basel i risk weighted assets for the denominator for the first four quarters, and basel iii standardized for the second four quarters. so it's a 2014 ccar, the advanced approach is not one of the critical tests, although it will likely be in the future. but in theory and in reality, that will reduce more dramatically on the stress than the other measure.
4;25;13;0;0.0;it was relatively flat, mike, in the low 30s, between 30% and 31%.
4;26;37;0;0.0;so it's consistent with what we said at investor day, in terms of the remaining jobs turning out of the branch networking consumer, as we implement new technology and new operating models, and new branch formats.
4;27;22;1;0.045454545454545456;well, i guess we're making huge progress on it, but it's not going to stop for years. it's permanent.
4;28;34;0;0.0;so mike, just what it's worth on page 2, very small in the footnote, we talk about that estimate of about 80% of mbs deal losses related to heritage investments. that's losses.
4;29;1;0;0.0;yes.
4;30;12;0;0.0;when you saw mortgage putback, are you talking about the gse putback?
4;31;17;0;0.0;i think have you to get that from other analysts who actually have published numbers like that.
4;32;166;1;0.006024096385542169;i think -- obviously, that's true, mike, so because this is very painful for the company, and so bear sterns we did do quickly. we did not anticipate that we would be paying anything for prior losses for bear sterns. i tell people, even the bear sterns number, i think it was $80 billion of bonds were made good which would have failed that day, had they gone bankrupt. and we did ask, we were not completely stupid. we did ask the sec for and only the sec for would they please agree not to take enforcement actions against jpmorgan against things that happened at bear, which of course they could not do outright, but they did say they would take into consideration the circumstances in which the transaction took place. and in wamu, we do not believe we're responsible by contract. but that does not mean that people can not come after you. so that was a little bit of a lesson learned too.
4;33;68;1;0.014705882352941176;we're going to do what's in the best interest of our shareholders, all things considered, it's a board level decision. and it needs to be fair, reasonable, taking consideration all of the facts and have some possible -- we would like to get it done, and if we can not, that's the board will make that decision. it's not a good choice either way.
4;34;76;1;0.013157894736842105;mike, the factor there was candidly that you were all trying to do this, you had most, or at least a large number of analysts that published research papers trying to recreate settlements and reserves three times, and for this one time only, we felt like it was helpful and transparent and constructive to show you the magnitude of reserves after these actions. so that you can have that context when you think about the future.
4;35;258;2;0.007751937984496124;yes, so first of all just to give context to that 6% to 7% down quarter over quarter, there is a portion of our expense base related to mortgage that's truly variable, so as production levels go down, we pay less compensation on the loans, and as a result, that's what you're seeing in this quarter. with respect to then rightsizing the expense base for the opportunity in the market, we have taken actions, as you have are aware in the third quarter, to start to do that SEMICOLON however, once you go beyond the truly variable costs, those actions take some four, or cases six months to truly get to the run rate. so while we would expect to see that start to come to fruition in the fourth quarter, not completely in the quarter, more as a run rate matter. and then there is a portion of costs that are more fixed, in terms of our ability to be able to participate, whether it's real estate technology and a core infrastructure. we are obviously also taking a look at that, but we are in this business, and so there will be an element of fixed costs into obviously next year. but you should expect that we're still seeing, absent lots go down slightly into the fourth quarter, so you should expect revenues will maybe be down, but expenses will also be down, for that net slight negative pretax margin that we've guided you to. that's still what we expect.
4;36;140;5;0.03571428571428571;let me brag on our commercial bank and investment bank bankers and they've opened up branches i want to say jacksonville, sacramento, nashville, so we're actually in more places in the commercial bank. obviously, we've been building in the wamu footprint in florida and california, they've been doing an exceptional job. and more importantly a high quality job, like we're really happy with the quality of the business we're booking. and our investment bankers you see the numbers in equity and debt and we did not mention all of the deals that we are involved in but verizon, and sprint, and nokia, there's good pipelines and good traffic. you know that can change tomorrow, but the fact is, we are satisfying our clients and we're thrilled with the business we're generating.
4;37;77;1;0.012987012987012988;so we do not expect or believe there should be any repercussions, but ultimately that's the regulators' decision so we resubmitted ccar in september. we're still waiting for feedback. we get feedback in early december. we will do a good, thoughtful and appropriate job of thinking through our capital asks as we do the 2014 ccar, so those will be the things that we do. and we're doing very little stock buyback right now.
4;38;172;3;0.01744186046511628;yes, volker, more detail on slr, more detail on how much long term debt, i think we have almost 20% of available resources today. and then you could look at things very basic and simple and say okay, well if the cost is a little bit higher and pricing stays the same and capital is higher, returns a little bit lower, that's true. but that does not take into consideration things we do not know which is repricing, competitor strategies, and our ability to optimize by client, by state, by region, by product so all those things, we just give you a better idea. we're very comfortable we've got a very good business, but we'll give you a better idea of what we think it means by business. for example, we're going to allocate more capital and operating capital to the businesses, we'll ask them to optimize on slr, and without damaging the client franchise, but we just will give you more detail. that's all.
4;39;171;1;0.005847953216374269;no, i think that a lot of people mentioned that they think it was inappropriate to apply capital to that, but the regulators will decide, whatever it is, we will be able to adjust to and conform to the rules. i would just point out that some of these things can move that number quite a bit and there's a reason why you should not overreact to it and just take the time and do it right. we know the final rules, we will conform. we conform very quickly, so it's just why would you conform very quickly and disrupt clients? so just think of it that way. we're trying to do the right thing to the client base and the company. we do not want to restrict, we could go out tomorrow and say we are not going to make anymore revolvers, and we will be there very quickly. we just do not want to do that. it's not a rational way to run a business.
4;40;1;0;0.0;right.
4;41;86;0;0.0;we are going to meet our targets through the run-off portfolio, which will cause a couple of things. part of the crm was a synthetic credit portfolio, which is, i'll say, 1/10 of the size it was a year ago and i do not remember the exact numbers, and we're still going to be optimizing across other products. there's certain things in mortgages that use up a lot of capital, et cetera. so we have more to go in optimizing rwa.
4;42;36;0;0.0;no, no, that one, but they had a small correlation book in the ib, this was a synthetic credit portfolio moved over to the ib, and eventually it will probably be put together. and much smaller.
4;43;10;0;0.0;yes. yes, we've received instructions and that does feature.
4;44;19;0;0.0;and it would not be the first time we modeled such an event as part of our stress testing.
4;45;105;2;0.01904761904761905;no. i think you should take that, i mean obviously it's very painful for me personally, because i agree with you, i do not like losing money obviously for my shareholders, and we put up, and marianne has been very clear. these are very tough numbers to estimate, it's a heightened environment, multiple agencies are involved in often the same thing. we're just trying to improve and get better and move on. remember, these reserves relate to things that took place over multiple years, so it is not a one year event, and we still did not lose money during the crisis.
4;46;193;2;0.010362694300518135;so i'm not expecting that the details and results will necessarily become public. remember, it was not a quantitative issue per se. it was a qualitative issue, so what the regulators are looking for is our response to their recommendations and substantial progress in that. i do think that it obviously would be public what their response has been to that, some time in december, and we'll work out exactly when that would be. so i would expect you to understand whether our plan has been accepted or otherwise at some point in december. and we're already working on the 2014 ccar submission. obviously that submission in early january, which means it's will be board approval in december and that is starting. all of the work, and jamie talked about it, he talked about 500 people, thousands of people involved, models, documentation, covenants, controls, all of that work that we did for the resubmission is fully being leveraged for our ongoing ccar processes, and we're building on it. so this for us will continue to become better over time, and 2014 will be another step in that process.
4;47;75;0;0.0;really most significantly, the other thing that we just talked about, which is in addition to all of the other minimum levels that we've been testing against, we have new tests under basel iii, albeit a test that recognizes savings in the capital numerator, and also a slightly different denominator through time, with different minimum levels of 4% in 2014, and 4.5% in 2015. so that's the other real big framework change.
4;48;68;0;0.0;so we obviously can not comment on any sort of discussions or status of any specifics on litigation. yes, you're right, the framework is probably an estimate. also you should obviously assume that we did not or could not estimate, all of these events were not probable at the time. but today, our reserves are appropriate for the current environment, and the information that we're allowed.
4;49;47;0;0.0;we're estimating some penalties, given the environment we would expect that some of the expenses would come with penalty nature, and you can obviously do the math from the front page. but they are estimates and they include a range of matters not limited to mortgage.
4;50;66;2;0.030303030303030304;actually, it's a great question. there is a fronting in that number of just shy of $2 billion, $1.7 billion that will ultimately be syndicated in the short-term, so i would adjust that out when you're looking at the quarter over quarter numbers. other than that, it's relatively flat and steady performance in core middle market and strength in real estate.
4;51;14;0;0.0;we can not comment. we've already said all we can say about that.
4;52;72;2;0.027777777777777776;it's going well but we're still, i think they are still building the systems to actually do it, and come with the products and services that we think can do a better job both for the merchants and for customers. but we're in active-- we're still working on that. that's not going to happen overnight. we just think it could be a very good thing over time.
4;53;7;0;0.0;yes, we will try to. we will.
4;54;40;0;0.0;essentially has flattened out at this point, yes. and we've begun to reinvest, we're looking at the overall portfolio, we're doing some rotation, and that process has started. remember, rates did go up almost 100 basis points.
4;55;223;3;0.013452914798206279;so just at a macro level, talking at the firm-wide level for a second, we've said that we're looking at running the firm at a basel iii tier 1 common ratio between 10% to 10.5%, which would imply, in any case tier 1 capital minimums will be 11% ultimately, so we'll be at 11%-plus from tier 1 capital and we talked about leverage running at 5.5% over time as well. and if you think about 11%-plus tier 1 capital, 10% to 10.5% basel iii common and a 5.5% supplementary leverage ratio given the ratio of our risk weighted assets to our balance sheet, they actually co-exist quite happily. so it is going to be a multi-variance of finding constraints, but at those levels, they exist quite nicely. obviously the devil is in the detail when you push down into the businesses, client by client, product by product, and that work will go on, and as we do that work, as jamie's talked about, we expect to be able to optimize, which will include some repricing and some restructuring of products. but at a macro level, they will co-exist relatively well. i always add to that ccar will be in our opinion another binding constraint over time. very good point.
4;56;54;1;0.018518518518518517;we do not know those rules yet, but presumably it's going to be equity plus preferred plus unsecured senior debt, and subordinated debt. and i think our number is at 20% of risk weighted assets there, so we're in a pretty good place but we'll see what the final rules are.
4;57;147;1;0.006802721088435374;so with pci-- i have to go because i have a meeting i have to go to, but appreciate the time with us, and marianne can answer the remaining questions. so the way to think about the pci reserve release its the first one we've taken, and it reflects obviously improved home prices and lower severities, but it's divided by model, so if all other things from here are equal, then we are what we are. obviously, if there are significant changes, probably primarily in home prices, but also in delinquencies, and you might see some more reserve releases. these are likely to be more periodic and lumpy, because obviously, we will be refreshing our loan loss reserves, or our life of loan forecasts over time. it's possible that you may see them in multiple quarters but that's not what we're expecting.
4;58;19;0;0.0;no there's no cause and effect there, obviously. well there's no cause and effect there. full stop.
4;59;174;2;0.011494252873563218;well i can certainly talk for jpmorgan, where as soon as we understand rules, we start to push them down into the organization, so that the people who are transacting at the products and the client level can make the best and most appropriate decisions to maximize returns and meet hurdles, and all of those sorts of good things. and you're right. over the last several years, we have seen capital and liquidity increase dramatically. meanwhile we are still delivering a core underlying performance in that mid-teens return on tangible common equity. so we're still competing effectively, which leads me to believe that others are doing the same thing, and that's being reflected in the competitive nature of the environment. i think it's obviously going to continue some, as we and others have set ourselves even higher targets for capital, and then obviously new rules including the slr, but i also do think these things work through the system through time pretty quickly, given the nature of the business.
4;60;68;0;0.0;so our lcr ratio last quarter was 118%. this quarter, we have not disclosed it, but it's not far off that same level. and the increase in cash is not necessarily because we're trying to do anything from a liquidity perspective, but it also reflects inflows from clients, both operating bills, and importantly non-core non-operating deposits that we then place with the central banks.
5;1;1;0;0.0; , guy.
5;2;134;3;0.022388059701492536;yes, so just a quick thing just to clarify. the 10 basis points is actually lower, not higher, so it's a deduct, not an add for the new basel proposal relative to the us rules. so remember as we've previously been disclosing our ratios, we used the us proposed rules that referenced a prior basel denominator, so it's a 10 basis point worsening. and you're right that we had two major things contributing to that. we had a positive associated with better assumptions on draws on unfunded commitments, slightly more than offset by a negative on the risk [credit] protection. so we're still working through the prior details but our best estimate is that it's in the mid 20s in basis points, 25 basis points plus or minus.
5;3;133;0;0.0;if you start with our gross growth cds protection written, it's about $3.4 trillion, and by the time you net down from maturities it gets down to a couple hundred billion, but that is still impactful. another thing to think about, it will be manageable because really this is kind of a static analysis before we start running the business slightly differently due to it. right. we saw the proposals as having been thoughtful and we do not necessarily have to agree with the finer points of all of them, but it does not materially change our position or our thoughts going forward. and as jamie said, all of our businesses will now socialize and optimize against what we understand to be the final rules when the us regulators adopt them.
5;4;86;0;0.0;yes, so, guy, we're obviously going to do a bit more of a detailed deep dive on expenses over time on investor day. so for now what we have said is that you should expect our adjusted expenses for 2014 to remain at or below that level of $60 billion. we also said that in 2014, the continuation of our control agenda is adding an incremental $1 billion over 2013, so by remaining flat we're effectively self-funding that $1 billion. that's down.
5;5;179;4;0.0223463687150838;we're not starving any expenses. we're just managing it in a disciplined way the way we've always done it and you look at the underlying numbers there's a lot of growth in the underlying numbers, but it's clearly true that some of the derisking and selling, spinoff oep, and physical commodities will affect revenues a little bit, but obviously profits less. and, guy, we've always been investing in the businesses and been willing to invest where the business takes and the returns justify that, but we are also finding efficiencies in the combination of the businesses, both consumer and the wholesale businesses, efficiency in the same store, branches we talked about, cib continues on its journey on the back office and front office integration, and obviously mortgage expenses will continue to trend down both in line with improved credit trends and also as we proactively manage the portfolio. so there's a lot of moving parts but it's not at the expense of our willingness to invest in the businesses for returns.
5;6;143;3;0.02097902097902098;it's not just about expenses. you have to think about the whole equation. if you look at a mortgage market we'll see some improvement in the first quarter 2014, and we'll also continue to work on expense efficiency in the business. but if you look at a market which is currently being estimated about $1.3 trillion, down from $1.9 trillion, and honestly a couple weeks ago it was $1.1 trillion, so it's a very small market, one we have not seen the likes of since year 2000, in a market like that it's very challenging to deliver through the cycle returns. so we went through over the last few years, years with very strong revenues and margins, and we are in a challenging environment as we look into 2014 but we're working on it.
5;7;145;1;0.006896551724137931;okay, so the way to think about it in the short-term relative to say the submission that we just did or in the near future is that obviously, a realized loss experience that is higher than we have previously seen informs your view and judgment as to what you could reasonably expect to happen in a future stress period. so it is fair to say that that would drive our expectations (inaudible) on operational losses to be slightly higher. having said that, it's not as if our previous submissions did not contemplate there to be significant stresses in operating losses, so i would characterize it as incremental and certainly not from a low base. and also, guy, sorry, just remember that every quarter we move forward we generate capital, improve our ratios, so there's lots of moving parts to the ultimate outcome.
5;8;1;0;0.0; , betsy.
5;9;102;0;0.0;i think the way you should look at it is something like $40 billion gets reinvested in a year. the basic assumption you should make is it's an average duration of three or four years, so think of a five-year bonds or something like that, and just use the implied yield curve. obviously (inaudible) munis or mbs or something like that, but i need to point out that it's completely dependent upon the decisions we make, so we can change that kind of at will if we want to extend or reduce the duration of equity of the company.
5;10;49;1;0.02040816326530612;it's both. it's a little bit of both. it's mostly just the change in the yield curve. we have slower mortgage fee payments, we're able to reinvest at higher yields, we're reinvesting in high quality assets, munis with high spreads, so it's both.
5;11;77;1;0.012987012987012988;well you have got to separate the loans. on the commercial side we'll obviously be competitive and we're not assuming anything heroic in terms of rate spreads getting worse or better but they're low. you could argue down the road they might actually go up a little bit as capital requirements and liquidity requirements go way up, so but we'll be competitive. we're assuming you have to be competitive in loan spreads.
5;12;44;0;0.0;think of the card business, we try to run it fully match funded so the spreads are about the same, and somewhere like 65% is at an interest rate something like 40% is transactor almost locked in rates, so which we also match fund.
5;13;154;0;0.0;so we have replaced 2 million debit cards or will have i think by the end of this week. credit and debit. credit and debit. to protect our employees, to protect our customers, et cetera. so i think that look, unfortunately, this cyber security stuff we've now pointed out for a year is a big deal, it's not going to go away, and all of us have a common interest in being protected so this might be a chance for retailers and banks to for once work together as opposed to sue each other like we've been doing the last decade, and but it's in all of our interest to do it. and i think all people involved in this know that the third parties with its machines, regional machines, your mainframes, you really have to put an extreme effort into protect yourself so this story is not over, unfortunately.
5;14;44;1;0.022727272727272728;yes, honestly i think you'll see both. i think you'll see chip and pin in all cards and then a lot of online type of transactions in tokenization. they both have very, very good technologies to protect consumers and companies from fraud.
5;15;4;0;0.0;yes, that's correct.
5;16;40;1;0.025;correct. there's an unrealized gain approximately of like $3 billion today. it's on our books of zero. this goes back to when visa was spun off many, many years ago. but that's right, betsy, net of hedging.
5;17;2;0;0.0;hi, glenn.
5;18;122;2;0.01639344262295082;i guess look, there are some structural headwinds and you've seen a lot of adjustment in the marketplace, people reduce the size of their inventory, and what you do not know going forward is what's going to happen to spreads. but i look at it a little bit like there's a secular and a cyclical. there will be headwinds from regulations et cetera. but over time, assets that people need to manage and buy and sell is going to go up over time, not go down. so what happens in 2014 is hard to say, our business is plenty diversified between rates, credit, emerging markets, fx, commodities, et cetera. certainly helping out stability. which is definitely helping out stability.
5;19;272;4;0.014705882352941176;i would say glenn it's ongoing and it will be beneficial. i think material might be a stretch at this point, but and it is a lot of work as you say, so there's a whole industry working on that and us too we expect to be beneficial but not a game changer. so the slr at 5% we do not think is going to be an issue for us. we barely begun to manage it, there are a lot of things you can do in how you change your business. the bank issue is a little bit different but think of that as more structural. what you did in the bank over the last 20 years and what we're not going to do in the bank going forward, that will take a little bit longer, but not because -- the reasons is it takes longer to change our business models to accommodate it. i also think if you look at the other things i mentioned in terms of opportunity for putting nim to one side, our estimate of the new basel rules that we had we've given you a 10 basis point movement backwards has a conservative estimate of what we could ultimately achieve over time in terms of the ability to net cash collateral for derivatives just given certain of the conditions. but again over time that will also be manageable like compression trades and like many of those other things. so we have not changed our view, we can manage against these targets by doing it thoughtfully and methodically and not having to race through it.
5;20;93;0;0.0;well we've said already that we would be willing to run between 10% to 10.5% so we're on a journey here. we think we can get 10% plus or minus at the end of the year. it could be plus and it could be minus but we think at this point based on what we know that running at that level of buffer of margins should be enough. obviously we'll be more informed as we go through ccar processes, but that's our point of view at this point.
5;21;145;2;0.013793103448275862;yes, so we have been adding, i mean i talked about the second half of the year gross adding $66 billion. we've never talked about second quarter, we added quite a lot in the second quarter, and yes we have plans to continue to do that in 2014, and yes, we expect our nii dollars to be relatively stable, possibly slightly up over the course of the top of the year, but relatively stable. but not in a lot of investments. look at the balance sheet today. we have almost $350 billion at central banks, most of it's fed. another $350 billion of very high quality investment securities, and those two things combined equal our loans of $700 billion. so the company's very, very liquid. we do not really need to invest more, but it depends on how much we grow deposits.
5;22;47;0;0.0;well i already said what we're going to do is what you should assume now is implied yield curves and constant reinvestment, but if you had rates move up 100 basis points all at once, we would probably be much more aggressive doing something like that.
5;23;106;0;0.0;so obviously, you're going to understand that the necessary caveat that we can not predict for you, the patent and the amount of legal expenses in any one quarter over several quarters SEMICOLON however it would be fair to say that we would certainly hope that for the full year, the full-year cost is not the first quarter annualized, but we can not be certain of that. and with respect to reasonably possible loss range, it did come down from $5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter to $5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter given the legal expense.
5;24;139;1;0.007194244604316547;yes, so i mean, if you think about -- and you can do -- we've done about as much as you can do based on analyst estimates, but if you think about we want to get to 10% plus or minus by the end of next year all else other things being equal, that is a priority, but it is not the only priority. and so as we think about our capital plan, we've consistently said obviously it's a board decision ultimately and they'll contemplate them in the natural course. but we would like to have the flexibility to be able to potentially increase dividends and also have flexibility to get to do reasonable repurchases, it would not be unreasonable for you to think about how we thought about this year as being relatively consistent with last.
5;25;128;1;0.0078125;so every year, we try to have a disciplined approach about what we stay in and what we do not, and i think we probably were more disciplined this year about the things we do not need, both from derisking, capital, management focus, controls, et cetera. if you look at the prepaid card business we are not dealing directly with customers, it's kind of secondary, it's a complex business and we were just better off letting someone else do it. it will not affect the four main franchises that marianne spoke about that are doing so well. it's just kind of a product we used to do so we're not going to do it anymore. there's a lot of risk associated with it.
5;26;126;5;0.03968253968253968;so we did not use the word cautiously optimistic. we're using the word optimistic because we are actually optimistic, and if you have a us economy starting to grow you will see loan growth and volume growth and of course all these businesses, we are actually optimistic about the us economy in particular. we spend a lot of time analyzing what rising rates, growth, change of qe3 taper will do to deposits, so it might actually have a diminishing effect on the growth of deposits, but we're happy with it, we're still growing share. i'm not sure you're going to see deposits go negative before you seen loan growth. i think you're trying to fine tune it too closely there.
5;27;113;3;0.02654867256637168;yes, so remember that in our card business we have both dynamics of core growth as well as still some continued run-off. we did reach the inflection point during the second half of 2013 where that run-off was no longer exceeding growth, and so we're set to grow but very modestly in 2014. but more importantly, 93% of the business awards, we've had 10% growth in spend, we've had was it 14% growth in merchant processing, so we are very happy with the card business. it performed exceptionally well, excellent credit trends so outstanding growth is less important but obviously we like to see some of that too.
5;28;1;0;0.0;no.
5;29;30;0;0.0;just a little bit relating to target but not in general. a lot of the card growth is coming from t&e and travel and restaurants and things like that.
5;30;221;5;0.02262443438914027;yes, so just to remind you what we said back in february or last year, in the consumer businesses we talked about over the two years, so 2013 and 2014, mortgage seeing headcount reductions of 13,000 to 15,000, and the consumer business predominantly in the branches of 4,000. by the end of 2013, we had seen a 16,500 in total, so in the consumer bank we are actually not only accelerated but outperforming our expectations in terms of our ability to run those branches efficiently and still maintain very strong customer satisfaction and retention rates. and then in the mortgage base, we have seen total headcount down 11% year over year against that 13,000 to 15,000 two-year target. so obviously we continue to work on the strategy and the size and our approach to mortgage market, but they're obviously relative to those numbers, there's still a little way to go. and remember sorry, remember that that was both production and servicing. what you saw given the rate environment in the middle of second half of 2013 is that some of the production-related headcount reductions were accelerated. we still have meaningful improvement expected in terms of delinquencies and foreclosures and modifications that will continue to drive cost and headcount down in 2014.
5;31;200;2;0.01;so i would think about -- talking about the number of branches i would think about the fact that it all goes to retail distribution, houses will continue to do consolidations and relocations as it makes sense for us to do that in our footprint, and we'll continue to respond to customer preferences, which will mean that over the course of the next decade we'll be looking at obviously the size and use of branches as branches come up for renovation and release and things like that. but we're not expecting a material change in the number as a macro matter, so 5,600 plus or minus, and it is going to be based on customer preferences. as it relates to headcount reductions, we're already aggressively looking at the efficiency in our same-store branches and have been very successful, so we are looking at starting models, physical capabilities, automation, we're on that journey and we continue to be on it, but i do not see that it's going to be a step change relative to our previous expectations. we've already exceeded them, might be some more, but it's not a step change.
5;32;287;4;0.013937282229965157;so let's start with commercial and say that it's plus or minus zero at this point, so i think it's going to be strong for long, but that's not really going to be a reserve story for a little while. in the card business, we had been talking about having potentially reached bottom for a period of time. we have not yet or it does not seem we have, so as you look into 2014, if things do continue to strengthen, it's possible there will be some more releases but not at the levels that you saw in 2013. so in the first couple of quarters, and usually the first quarters are instructive on that point, usually that's when you see a material improvement if there's going to be one in terms of flow rates. and then on the mortgage space, two things. we have $2.6 billion of nci reserve left. we've talked before about the fact that we think our more steady run rate number will be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, so there's another $1 billion to $1.5 billion to come in that space over the course of the next year or so potentially, obviously environment allowing. and then on an nci --- i'm sorry --- on the purchased credit impaired portfolio, we have $4.2 billion left off the two releases we just took. but remember that it's a life-of-loan portfolio. so something would have to change now, and the environment improve, for us to expect to take more releases. it is possible, but nothing --- we do not expect to be taking releases up to that $4.2 billion.
5;33;0;0;NA; .
5;34;34;0;0.0;yes, we did have some tax benefits this quarter. we had about $300 million after-tax. related to a number of items but state and local tax, some reserve releases, not one particular thing.
5;35;10;0;0.0;it was just a little over 30%, low 30%s.
5;36;2;0;0.0;no change.
5;37;54;1;0.018518518518518517;yes. yes, so we said i think at investor day plus 100, plus or minus in a year, when gordon spoke earlier in 2013, we've revisited based upon our assessment of cost and preferences and activity and think we've got the footprint where we are happy at 5,600 plus or minus. ---
5;38;19;0;0.0;so if you look at bab and then obviously also at investor day we'll go through it more.
5;39;223;12;0.053811659192825115;so it's a bit of both. just one thing on mortgage. just a tiny clarification. we expect mortgage deductions to be broadly the same as we've seen in the second half but we would expect to continue to see improvements in the expense base in the servicing business. but having said all of that it's a combination of relatively stable but potentially slightly higher nii. yes, strength in fees on the basis of the strong driver growth that we talked about, and then our $60 billion or less of expenses. so we're working through all of the efficiency opportunities across the businesses, including in the retail space to be able to deliver positive operating leverage. and mike i think the way you get to it is each of our businesses is always trying to drive efficiency while investing. that does not change any particular year. it's kind of a non-stop kind of thing and you see those efficiencies because every business has pretty good margins after investing. and sometimes the revenue growth itself is either episodic or the timing is not exactly the same how you invest, but if you see the drivers, which is deposits, investable assets, asset management, number of corporate clients, market shares, they are all pretty positive so we're not going to --
5;40;376;9;0.023936170212765957;well var itself is a calculation that's based upon a whole bunch of different things. we do not deliberately lower var. with var, mike it really is just a feature of two things. if you look at our look back at var, across asset classes we're at very low levels of volatility, just across all of the asset classes, and that's actually driving it. if volatility picks up, that could pick up, we're not driving that down, and it's also derisking an sep, that is a little bit proactive but it's obviously mostly done now, so then on cib -- actually we did a number, if you would stay with the volatility that was 18 months ago, var itself would be like $60 million or $70 million just all on its own so without changing your position et cetera. so mike, the hardest business to get a handle on is cib, when you talk about the short run, but what we see is investors still have to buy social securities, corporations have ecm and dcm, and you could predict the rolloff et cetera. the backlogs are pretty good. you saw a tremendous amount of ipos in 2013. you saw a lot of debt financings, you've already seen a bunch of m&a earlier this year, so we do not budget or plan that you're going to have an unbelievable year in cib, but if you ask me, the long-term prospects are good. it's probably the business that has to go through the most adjustments in the new regulatory environment, but the long-term prospects are pretty good, so our margins are good, our returns are good. you see our comp levels of 30%, down from 38% a couple years ago, really reflecting higher capital et cetera. but at that comp level we can pay our people well, grow the franchise all around the world, serve our clients, and still get decent returns. so we feel very good about the business and one of these days it's going to boom, and it's not going to boom because we, you can get just like i can guess when that might happen but it will happen one day.
5;41;78;0;0.0;volcker, all things equal we would say not much. i think when we referred to the $1 billion or $2 billion, we were talking about regulations in general, including derivatives, sas, clearing houses, and volcker, and that number we still kind of have in the back of our mind but it's hard to tell what the effect of all those things are. the $1 billion or $2 billion i would say was probably in the conservative category.
5;42;153;0;0.0;that's the one that's hard to tell. i would guess-- yes, so it's very difficult to back test because these things are all interrelated so it's not entirely possible to disentangle everything, but obviously we've gone through the changes in 2013, some of that will be reflected, but this is a number that we would expect to be reflected to the degree that it is all over the course of the next two years. remember some of those things reduce capital requirements, some people are making dramatic changes in their business models which may free up market share for those of us that have additional market share, so it all remains to be seen. and that was also a static analysis. some certain things we may reprice a little bit because of the capital liquidity requirements around them, so it all remains to be seen. thank you, mike.
5;43;124;2;0.016129032258064516;so i would just reiterate what we previously said, which is if you look at servicing and in particular, the quarterly run rate, which call it $600 million in line with our expectation that's going to continue to trend down towards $500 million by the end of the year in 2014. and then on the production side while we obviously are going to see our expenses to a degree of variable with the size of the market, we're continuing to also work on opportunities to make the fixed cost base more efficient, so hopefully we'll deliver some of that in 2014 too. and we'll do a more precise job of putting a bow around that for you at investor day.
5;44;260;4;0.015384615384615385;so that's an excellent question. i would say assuming we have no significant losses going forward then we feel like we should be close to our high point, albeit maybe a little bit more in the first half of 2014. the reality, just two comments on operational risk. the first is unlike market and credit risk, although all of the parameters and the confidence levels are effectively the same, it does not naturally recalibrate itself to changes in the business environment, or to your business mix or model, if you structurally reduce risk. it's very backward-looking, and in that sense it differs because it does not recalibrate. and so, as a result if you just let the models continue to predict based on historical losses going forward, you would need to be carrying that elevated level of operational risk capital forward for a reasonably long time. it's a 1 in a 1,000 year horizon, so think about it in terms of 5 or 10 years, not 1 or 2 years. and so for that reason, we are very interested and working very hard with the industry to try and figure out how to better model changes in the business environment, and to both model and defend structural and permanent risk changes in our businesses in order to be able to recoup some of that more quickly. but at this point i would characterize that as work that has not yet been done, that is in progress, and so for the foreseeable futurity will be elevated.
5;45;1;0;0.0; , matt.
5;46;152;3;0.019736842105263157;okay. so to put volcker aside for a second, with respect we did not update obviously the list, we are going to do that at investor day. we talked about that for you. it's more important to think less about revenue, but more on the impact on the bottom line, given some of these businesses they now have been returning hurdle, may have been in the investment phase, and actually not been breaking even. so i think it's fair to say that if you consider the impact on the bottom line more so than revenues that it's going to be modest, and we will do work to update you on that. but remember, it also is going to do two things, release capital which will be a positive, and also improve the quality of the businesses and the control environment and the complexity which would all be positive too.
5;47;71;0;0.0;it is the ones that you all mentioned, and we put them in our 10-k. yes, it is the ones you mentioned, and as you look at our disclosures in the 10-q. every quarter, the items that we think raise themselves to the level of public disclosure are in that document. so look to last quarter and next quarter and you will see, but we should not comment specifically.
5;48;18;0;0.0;i do not think so. not this point, but obviously the ks are a few weeks away. yes.
5;49;217;0;0.0;so i mean, i think -- if you think about the sort of basis for capital and put aside whether you like the way it works in a modeled environment, your reserves, that is for expected losses and capital to your expected losses. so in theory you should not get explicit credit for them. i think the bigger point for us is, if you look at the sorts of things driving our capital levels to be as elevated as they are, they are things for example, like the plmbs issues, and also certain of the very large mortgage doj and national mortgage settlement and isr compensation issues. it's our belief that this firm is not exposed today or will not be exposed going forward to those levels of risk, at anywhere near that scale going forward. but as i have said, we have no ability at this point to scale those back, and that's what we are very focused on. so it's less really about whether we are getting credit for our reserves, and a little bit more about how we try in the industry to evolve the framework in partnership with the regulators, and defend over time that there are structural risk reductions that mean those risks are no longer present in that scale.
5;50;1;0;0.0;yes.
5;51;47;2;0.0425531914893617;not specifically. we did fairly well in cash, but our cash platform is not as mature as some others. so i think we would characterize the performance as good, but coming off of as i said a very strong quarter for equity derivatives in the third quarter.
5;52;102;0;0.0;so just i'll comment. on page 15 last quarter, we showed you a bunch of things we're working on. we did not replace the page, because it has not meaningfully changed. that is not to say that at the margins we do not continue to look at our businesses in terms of sophistication and derisking. so i would say that while there may be things that the margin that we will explore over time, then there is nothing structurally big that you should be aware of. and again, we will do some more of that for you at investor day.
5;53;134;1;0.007462686567164179;that's a hard question but -- so middle market if you go back -- so i am going to do just middle market because that's the one that's kind of at a 30% too. years ago, you used to average more like 45%. it looks like to us, that what you have -- is they have a lot more deposits and a lot less utilization. and so obviously, they are going to use some of their own money before they borrow against a revolver or something like that, and one day, you would expect it to go up. we are not guessing what's going to happen in 2014, but i would say, we will be sitting here one day when you have had a very strong economy it will be 10 points higher.
5;54;52;0;0.0;well multi-families a big portion of that and you see that in a lot of -- i would say obviously the major cities is pretty much where you would say -- it's hard to answer specifically. i think both multi-family and other real estate loans, it's really the big cities.
5;55;109;0;0.0;sure. change either that, or how you reimburse clients for deposits, and obviously it will go into how you price them on your business. we are not expecting that to happen, but obviously we would do that, and you have other alternatives, so you might invest some of that money elsewhere. yes, and it's also important to point out there is a large portion of that $350 billion are deposits or cash that we would consider to be client non-operational deposit. and as a result, we do not give ourselves any liquidity value for those, so that is why we are putting them overnight in the fed.
5;56;79;2;0.02531645569620253;mostly marketing. yes, it's predominantly marketing, and with respect to marketing it can be lumpy quarter to quarter. so it's not an unexpected number for us, it's just higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third. but we have been doing a good job of card acquisition of high quality cards. you see -- i forgot the number, but it's up quite a bit. so we have some good active programs out there.
5;57;145;2;0.013793103448275862;way optimistic. yes, i think that would be optimistic. obviously, we will determine the third quarter as we go through it. we will cover employee issuance, but that's certainly our expectation and maybe more, but i do not think you should expect us to catch up from pb. remember, we want to meet our own objective of the 9.5% or 10%. and obviously the litigation costs hurt our ability to do that, so we caught up on that. and also the stock price is a lot higher than it was when we talked about trying to aggressively buyback some stock. so we always look at that as a important thing. we do not just buyback stock regardless of price. not that we can not get that price, but when it was at $33 a share or whatever, that was a extraordinary compelling price.
5;58;150;2;0.013333333333333334;the board will decide when the time comes and they look at all of the priorities et cetera. i would just reiterate what i said before, which is getting to our target ratio is a priority, it is not the only one. we will have to see how things play out in 2014. but if you do the math then you can take your own estimates of what you think we will earn next year. we should be able to also have the opportunity to take it to buy more than just employee issuance, so you are just going have to -- we want that flexibility. that is what we submitted for, and we will obviously manage through each quarter as we see it. it may depend on what we sell, how much we can mitigate, what the final rules are and stuff, so there is a lot of moving parts.
5;59;9;0;0.0;it's just a little less than $100 million.
5;60;18;0;0.0;yes. so there is no change -- (multiple speakers). there is no real change in how we do anything.
5;61;22;0;0.0;are you talking about total loans -- ? are you talking about total and core, or are you talking about reported and -- ? yes. okay.
5;62;167;1;0.005988023952095809;okay. so i am going to try to answer the question, and tell me if i do not i'm sorry. but if you look at our actual total loans for the whole firm year-over-year, our gross reported was 0.6%, so just call it just shy of 1%. but underlying that core loan growth was about 4%. so i think that as we look forward, we expect core growth to continue at or stronger than those levels, and we have reached as you say in card the point where seasonality aside, that inflection point where we should expect net modest growth. so and as i said, we are going to have to all wait and see how client demand plays out in the small business and middle market space. but we are hoping that at the second half of 2014, when the confidence in the economic recovery -- we have confidence but when others join us, that they will actually start to borrow and spend.
5;63;5;0;0.0;yes, that's our hope.
5;64;83;1;0.012048192771084338;because we also are seeing -- we talked earlier about the fact we have been seeing and we expect to continue to see some spread compression in loans, that at this point in the near-term -- we did not talk about the whole year for 2014 but in the near-term, we are expecting the improvement that we would see as a result of higher yields on investment securities et cetera to be offset by or largely offset by the compression in loan growth.
5;65;89;1;0.011235955056179775;the way to look at that is that, is what drives the company is serving clients. and so, we do not target just to get rid of commitments or something like that. but obviously, we have asked all of the people in businesses who to start to optimize a little bit commitments, balance sheet, lcr, slr, basel iii. and so, you probably see a little bit of a squeeze in commitments as they do that, but not at the expense of trying to do a good job for clients.
5;66;35;0;0.0;the other thing i should point out is some of those commitments are much more capital or liquidity hogs than others. so that is where you can see a little bit more of the squeeze.
5;67;152;1;0.006578947368421052;so i think if you look back and see that -- i mean, let's talk about this year and last year. if you look at 2013 reported, you would have seen that our commodities revenues counted for in the low teens of our markets revenues, but that's on an accounting basis. when you think about, so that's just a revenue pure only. if you think about the economic revenue because obviously it's an accounting growth where it is much smaller number than that. so call it mid single digit, mid to 6%, 7%. but then it was a business that was in a combination of being built out so it was not fully mature. and also we are selling parts of the business that are highly capital intensive to us. so think about the impact of the bottom line as being considerably more modest and with some capital benefit.
5;68;193;1;0.0051813471502590676;so i would -- a couple things. first of all, if you just take the second half versus first half, we said that we thought the overall market was down 30% to 40%. it was down about 33%. so it was in line with our expectations and our performance is in line with that too. so you have got to remember that the revenue versus closed loan volume, and how that gets recognized there is some timing differences. with respect to market share, if you look backwards into 2013, the overall size of the market was revised up, which means that our market share was -- all else things being equal --just relatively revised down, does not change anything. but going forward, our market share will be a factor of obviously the size of the market, but also our pricing discipline to make sure we want to get an appropriate risk adjusted return. so we would gain share but only if we can do it, getting paid for the risk and the cost of servicing. and the whole reduction was refi. and the whole reductions was refi -- yes, i should say that, yes. (multiple speakers).
5;69;143;0;0.0;so i would say that people in the business has slowly been extending the credit box, if you look at ltv -- i am talking about over the last 18 months, if you look at ltvs, if you go to different cities, i am not sure you are going to see a dramatic expansion of the credit box, because all of the rep and warranty and litigation and stuff like that, where anything that is not qualified mortgages. yes, and for qualified mortgages, credit is available, gse is 90% ltv, on the ginnie mae side closer to 100% ltv, so there is credit availability. you just have to have the ability to pay. and fha will set its own policy. but even there i think you'll have a much tighter underwriting than the fha guidelines, because of how much fha's cost people.
5;70;175;0;0.0;i think we know for the most part the contours of the regulation at this point, and some of the fine tuning still needs to be done. so you can see a lot of banks globally, adjusting to the new financial architecture, and the effect of that will be different, different parts of the world, slightly different for certain products, but it will probably be okay in total. but it's nice to, i mean -- have the rules. nice to have the rules and live with them, and now we have to push them down and understand them in a little more detail. there is still a few things we are waiting for, i mean, long-term debt requirements, something to look out for in the first quarter, but i mean, having more clarity is definitely helpful. you have seen some people make bigger strategic changes, some are making small tactical changes, and then we are going to report a lot more on what we think the effect of all of this in investor day.
5;71;205;2;0.00975609756097561;again, i look a little bit different. i look like -- the pot will change and adjust to new world, but from there will probably grow. because if you look at underlying numbers, the amount of investable assets around the world is going to double over 10 years, the amount of needs of corporations, i.e -- and sovereigns and super nationals, and ecm, dcm advice will double over 10 years, so there is a -- there will be a strong underlying business. spreads, products, those things have always changed. spreads have been coming down my whole life, and yet we have a healthy business -- and so we expect that fixed income after some adjustment will be a good business. we think a lot of these trends are cyclical, not secular and that's how we are positioned for it. and we have paychecks. and we have -- (multiple speakers). and it is possible that -- if people leave and the things we price it will go back to -- all businesses have to have a normal return on capital for the average player otherwise they would not exist. so we do think you will see some of that. there will be pieces that go to non-banks which is fine.
5;72;140;2;0.014285714285714285;look, i think the reality is i do not know anymore than you do. i just that think given the changes that were made, it seemed to be positive and constructive as reason to believe that the us regulators would want to leverage that. i could be wrong, and i am not aware of -- obviously, we did comment letters on the us mpr, but i am not aware of any specifics on the portion. so i would just add, if you listen to what regulators said, not this time, but going back they intended to make basel and us rules common about the rules. they did not say they intended to have the same percent. so we are just assuming the 5% is going to stay. correct. and we think there will be a couple other adjustments going forward too.
5;73;158;0;0.0;so if you look at the total firm consolidated, then they actually come out quite nicely. if you think about our target for [tier 1] common at 10% to 10.5% and a leverage target of 5% to 5.5%. so i think the leverage ratio feels like as a consolidated matter, it is a simple backstop exactly as it is supposed to be and not a binding constraint. the devil is in the detail as you push that down, as i have said for the individual business and products. and then, obviously consider it in the context of the whole client relationship. i think as we look forward, ccar is something to just be thoughtful about. because it's a stressed scenario. it is evolving in terms of the maturity, as well as a move over time towards being on a basel iii advanced approach. so if i had to guess i would say ccar could be.
5;74;51;0;0.0;i would say -- so i would say that our tier 1 capital needs to be at 11%-plus. we said we are going to run it at 10% to 10.5% above [tier 1] common. i would suggest the gap will be prepped and maybe more. maybe more prepped than that.
6;1;2;0;0.0;hi, glenn.
6;2;171;0;0.0;so hey, glenn. just so that i can give you the underlying core growth number, for the firm for the quarter was 4% year on year, even though obviously if you take into consideration the run-off portfolios in mortgage and card we were closer to flat. in c&i, you're right. the industry was up slightly. we were not. it's a continuation of the things we've talked about, which is a combination of client selection, of being very disciplined on credit, so not chasing growth at the cost of liberal credit structures or overly aggressive pricing, and also the fact that we continued to see some of our criticized and classified loans be refinanced away from us. so we're just going to hold the line on discipline. we are seeing the ongoing aggressive competitive environment on both credit terms and pricing, and we'll do every rational and sensible deal we can do, but we're not going to chase growth at the expense of discipline.
6;3;9;0;0.0;yes, so a higher quality portfolio, higher quality clients.
6;4;127;1;0.007874015748031496;so i think very broadly if you look at the numbers here we've pushed down our capital, leverage, slr to all of the businesses so they're all making adjustments as appropriate. in the rates business in particular, you're seeing that there's very few what i call exotic rates products being done anymore, so that will be a rather large change. a lot of things going electronic, which can reduce your expenses too, so we're pretty comfortable our rates business will be normal profitability going forward. it may take a little bit of time. glenn, i just want to make sure that it was clear in my remarks that the impact of the new proposal for leverage is included in the reported results.
6;5;39;1;0.02564102564102564;a little bit, yes. but we all do not know what's going to happen to spreads going forward, so we're comfortable, we want to stay in the business, do a good job at it for our clients.
6;6;122;2;0.01639344262295082;so with lcr, whether you take the basel or the us proposals, we're compliant at this point with the margin, and importantly we're also compliant with our own internal stress framework. so we feel good about lcr, we're continuing to manage it as you would expect. yes, i am expecting us to get long-term debt rules this year, but i do not know when and i can not control it SEMICOLON we feel with over 19% available resources that we're in a good starting position, and so we're not really going to be in the business of guessing where that ends up. and we'll adjust accordingly if it's different from our expectations. thank you.
6;7;215;5;0.023255813953488372;so given that we did some restructuring of bank level capital including some downstreaming, that was a fairly sizeable increase in the quarter, so you're not going to see progress be linear, but there are a number of different levers that we have in our toolkit so to speak to get to 6% over time, whether that's this year or whether that's into next year, we're going to be measured about the progress. so whether that's retaining earnings, potentially additional capital, we've been actioning leverage actions, both deposits as well as derivatives actions. and then ultimately there's also the [good guide] when it comes, timing dependent that may be a 2015 thing of hopefully moving from cem to the newly named faccr calculations for derivatives central future exposure. we did take a look at the information on faccr and it has not changed our point of view that we would expect that to have a favorable impact for the bank of 40 basis points plus or minus. so when that comes that will be a nice boost, but through retaining earnings and the leverage actions we have and potentially more capital optimization, we have a clear path to 6%, whether it's this year or early into 2015.
6;8;75;5;0.06666666666666667;yes, i would say it's fair to assume that our core margin should be relatively stable throughout the year, and i think plus or minus 2 basis points on a large balance sheet like ours with mix changes is relatively stable. so our expectation is for core nim to be relatively stable in 2014, to be stable to slightly positive in 2015, assuming that the implied rate curve plays out the way it is.
6;9;106;0;0.0;so it's a combination of factors and we are seeing delinquency trends and roll rate charge-offs flatten out. we knew that it would happen one day. that's what we're seeing at the moment. we'll continue to update you through the course of the year SEMICOLON based upon that we're not expecting anymore results. in addition, you should know that -- you saw our outstandings were flat, and underneath that our core portfolio is growing SEMICOLON we still do believe we are at that inflection point and that we should see some growth, but it will be relatively modest. thank you, erika.
6;10;0;0;NA; .
6;11;9;0;0.0;so you're talking about interchange fees in card?
6;12;58;1;0.017241379310344827;yes, so the sales volume obviously seasonally goes down quarter over quarter. i do not think that we have perceived there's been a significant impact from weather on card sales in the first quarter SEMICOLON for us our sales were up 10% year on year, so pretty strong. no, i would not attribute anything to the weather.
6;13;108;0;0.0;yes, so you saw -- obviously you saw in the first quarter that on the back of lower revenues in the markets business, we have lower compensation as an absolute matter albeit that the ratio is relatively in line. so you're absolutely right depending upon how the rest of the year pans out will determine whether the compensation expenses inherent in our outlook for cib are up or down or flat, and that will adjust our ending result. we're not ready yet to declare our position on the whole year, so less than $59 billion is still our guidance but we intend to be very, very disciplined.
6;14;136;2;0.014705882352941176;yes, so on the timing, i mentioned the fact that we are not expecting our capital accretion to 10% plus to be linear, we're expecting it to be much more in the second half of the year, flatter in the first half, so it's reasonable to expect that we will be covering employee issuance plus or minus in the first half of the year with most of our repurchase capacity being available for us in the second half. as to how much of it we'll use will be dependent on a number of factors including obviously our share price at the time. but we do intend to take advantage of the opportunity that we have been given to buy back, and we'll see what the absolute level is when we get there.
6;15;33;0;0.0;that's absolutely right, so when we declared at investor day that we had increased the target rate for that business, we pushed that down into the valuation of the asset one-time.
6;16;177;9;0.05084745762711865;so it's three things. there's a little bit of timing in there insofar as we did make continued improvement in expenses and we're going to continue to work on what we would characterize as the sort of fixed cost base. it's definitely the case that we are building this business for the long run, and so we continue to invest in technology and operations to make us more profitable and efficient through the cycle. but it is also the case that it is an incredibly small market. i mean, the market size was sub $250 billion, so annualized sub $1 trillion, which is not something we've seen since before 2000. so the reality is in a market that size, it's very hard to have strong profitability or profitability when you have to have a core level of fixed expenses, and so we're thinking about this business over the longer run to be as efficient and profitable as possible through the cycle in markets that are on average bigger than this.
6;17;57;0;0.0;so yes, i would say lower issuance was a factor but there were very many, so i would not say that it was a single driving factor, lower mortgage issuance, lower debt issuance, a whole bunch of different things. and then as to catalysts, more volatility, more growth, and we'll just have to wait and see.
6;18;74;3;0.04054054054054054;i think john we've always been very consistent on this kind of thing. you guys have got to make your own estimates because they are just as good as ours. great business with great people, technology, sales, research, but we can not predict it going forward. it will be what it is. similar to the mortgage comment where it's a long-term view, it affects the business and this is one quarter.
6;19;16;0;0.0;yes, we've accounted for it held for sale and no significant impacts to the results.
6;20;52;0;0.0;so we obviously looked at the bid and the valuation and any of the difference versus book is in our p&l and it's insignificant, and we are engaged in ongoing relationship with the buyer, and we'll realize [that over] time. but it's not expected to be anything significant.
6;21;2;0;0.0;yes, correct.
6;22;16;1;0.0625;no, it's fully phased in, it's our best effort of fully phased in, betsy.
6;23;45;1;0.022222222222222223;correct, but remember that with the exception of the fact that we are not baking in things that are not yet certain, so we have not baked in the benefit that we would expect, for example, from faccr, because it has not yet been acknowledged.
6;24;31;0;0.0;the sensitivity is different at the bank and the holding company, so it's more like 30 plus or minus at the holding company, 40 plus or minus at the bank.
6;25;60;1;0.016666666666666666;with respect to the headcount reduction in the first quarter, the severance was not significant and the benefit is largely in. remember we said that overall the firm is expecting to see headcount go down by about 5,000 for the full year and it's down only by 2,000, so far so we have another way to go.
6;26;57;0;0.0;well so if you think about it gross, mortgage was 6,000 of the total gross and it's 3,000 in, so another 3,000 to go i would say in the nearer not longer term. and in the consumer bank that was 2,000, with 1,500 in, the remainder will just happen through time.
6;27;1;0;0.0;hi.
6;28;109;1;0.009174311926605505;yes, i'll give you the sort of very short qualitative answer, and then if you want to really dig in, i'd do it off line with investor relations. but the very short answer is there's an additional ability to recognize collateral and [netting], that was not in the original cem calculation, there's lots and lots of other complexity to it. we are doing our best to estimate it. we have not fully built the models to do it, so we're continuing to work on that, but if you want to get into a very technical discussion on it we can arrange that for you.
6;29;202;3;0.01485148514851485;okay, so a couple of things. first is that if you remember from investor day, notwithstanding the earlier comment about the volatility potentially in compensation in the markets businesses, we said we would be below $59 billion, and there were four principal things driving that. so in our favor we have efficiencies in branches, efficiencies in cib, and mainly mortgage down about $1.5 billion year over year. and against us we had the $1 billion incremental cost of control and some growth principally in asset management, so the net of all of those meant that we were effectively self-funding through efficiency and reduced mortgage expenses, the incremental cost and controls that you're seeing come through. it is not the case that we have broken out as a macro matter how much of that $1 billion is in our run rate now, and maybe we'll do that for you next quarter. i would say that we are adding heads and so these things do take some time SEMICOLON even though i believe that there will be a chunk of it in our run rate through the middle of the year, it's not all in our run rate yet.
6;30;90;1;0.011111111111111112;well i'll have to confirm to you next quarter, but i would say that we would have a majority of it in through the midyear because we are obviously trying to hire up to be able to execute on the agenda. so if you think about the impact we're trying to add people to compliance, we are adding people to compliance, to legal, to audit, to finance, to risk, and we're doing that largely in the first half of the year, but there will be a tail.
6;31;124;0;0.0;yes, so i mean, it's very -- as you know it's very, very difficult to decouple everything but and so it's not clear that there's no impact, but it's not our sense that it was a significant driver of the performance in the quarter, and there is a limited amount of volume on sef right now, albeit increasing, and there's been margin compression, but from tight margins to start with. so it's not our sense that it was a significant driver, not to say that there was no impact. so it did come down a little bit but it's kind of back to where it was, the derivative trading, and we would not blame that for anything.
6;32;62;3;0.04838709677419355;that's right. so i mean again, not to say there has not been any but the volumes are relatively low, the margins are relatively tight, the $1 billion we talked about which is by the way our best estimate, so it could be better than that, is something that would progress through time, it's not going to be a cliff.
6;33;2;0;0.0;thank you.
6;34;100;2;0.02;so the best guidance that i could give you is the guidance that we gave at investor day, which is expect the firm-wide charge-offs to be at around $5 billion plus or minus, and then i would point you to the guidance we just gave you on reserve releases, which is expect some more in mortgage but modest, expect we might have some in pci but it's too early to know, and that little more in card, so net those two down. and there may be some noise to that, but that's our current best outlook.
6;35;9;0;0.0;yes, largely speaking. that seems about right, 10%, yes.
6;36;170;0;0.0;so our production revenues this quarter, just to make sure we're talking about the same thing, was just about $300 million. i told you that we're expecting the second quarter to be negative, you're going to have higher revenues because seasonally you have higher volumes, but obviously it's market dependent. so i would say given seasonality, the first quarter was small and volumes were depressed given the weather, we would be hopeful that the market would be above $1 trillion for the full year, maybe not quite as high as $1.2 trillion, so if you add seasonality back in and gross up the number, you could probably get quite close. but of course it could all change depending upon rates in the market. the current outlook for the market size was about $1.2 trillion. i suspect that will be revised down slightly on the back of the first quarter, so we're going to have a small market. it will not be absolutely linear.
6;37;41;0;0.0;year-over-year revenues for asset management, institutional, no specific. we had some -- march was not strong, the first quarter for institutional was not as strong as the other segments, so no specific issues but there's some lumpiness there obviously.
6;38;83;2;0.024096385542168676;yes, the securities, that line item is a funky feature of the fact that in our prime services business, when we -- our contractual income is libor minus the spread which drives that to be a negative number SEMICOLON i would not read too much into the trend and volatility there. the absolute economics of the business is still positive and the offset is in trading liability, so that's not a line item in its own right and alone that is very constructive.
6;39;2;0;0.0;reserve releases.
6;40;21;0;0.0;and then we do not drill into every $50 million negative non-recurring item but there was some of them too.
6;41;54;2;0.037037037037037035;no, it's not far off the 30% plus or minus, which is our generally expected effective tax rate. nothing else of any noteworthiness. i mean obviously it's always going to be impacted by the absolute level of pretax, the percentage of overseas income, the percentage of tax efficient income, but nothing special.
6;42;48;0;0.0;we have not really changed our guidance, to be fair our guidance was always to be negative for the year. we're just trying to be very specific about the degree of negative in the second quarter to make sure you have information for your models. thank you.
6;43;85;3;0.03529411764705882;so obviously the timing of sales is going to be a little bit opportunistic, so the best comment i can make is that $600 million number is two, three years away from now, not necessarily but we'll try and manage it the best way we can. and then with respect to the ability to sell sub service, there is still the opportunity to do it. it's just not necessarily the case that you can defease your risk entirely, which i think is understood.
6;44;99;0;0.0;well i mean, insofar as i think that as we move loans to sub services, obviously we retain the risks and have to have third-party oversight. to the degree we sell them, i think the regulators are potentially looking at originators to continue to bear some of the origination and other risks. we're going to run the msr for returns and quality, so it's also a question of what you put into it so you should probably expect to see less fha and things like that, and then you'll see some run-off over time.
6;45;142;1;0.007042253521126761;it's almost impossible to tell, but there are -- if you're jumbo you can get loans, if you are gse you can get loans, but almost all the other stuff in between, anything with any hair on it like if you ever had a credit problem, if you are earning self-reported income, so a lot of people have overlay, they're being tougher than is required by fha, gse, or their own rules because of reps and warranties, et cetera. and i do not know when that's going to go away. it's not getting worse. it's just sitting there and probably holding back a little bit the purchase market. think about the credit is available across the ltv spectrum, but the bar to be able to document income and prove ability to repay under qm is high.
6;46;0;0;NA; .
6;47;155;1;0.0064516129032258064;so the models that were disapproved we understood that we were going to have certain of our models that needed additional work to be acceptable by the regulators of basel iii when we gave the guidance at investor day, so as a large matter as we sit here today, that's still our best understanding of how things will work out absent there being any new news or issues during the year. it's a timing difference as opposed to a target difference. yes, the whole industry submitted a huge number of models under basel 2.5 to the regulators to review at the beginning of 2013. we had an approval to use them for the year while they were being reviewed and pending after the review SEMICOLON we got some feedback and we're going to remediate the models and resubmit them for approval. so it will take us time but it is timing.
6;48;37;0;0.0;just assume it's going to be fairly constant. when we know what the real rules are we may modify that. that's right. we're not managing to an ola that we do not know yet.
6;49;88;3;0.03409090909090909;well we told you we are firmly supportive of having proper and good markets for everybody, and we think we have pretty good policies and protocols in place. but i do not know what it will do to other -- there are issues in market structures with some pools et cetera, but we just have to let that review take place. i should point out in michael lewis' book which i did not read on page 231, they refer to us as one of the good guys. thank you.
6;50;187;5;0.026737967914438502;so a couple of things. as you know, we have been investing and building our branch to the place it is now where we're happy with the distribution capability we have, so that was driving a lot of the investment. in 2014 we continue to invest in [quarterly] and digital and the cost to serve and efficiency so that we can drive the ratios down. we guided at investor day to expect expenses in the business to be up 1%, so a little but not the kind of increase that we've been seeing after which you should expect it to start to come down. and we said that the overall ccb business including mortgage would be down $2 billion by 2016 over 2014, and a chunk of that is in cbd. so we are very focused on it and investing in fact in the technology and processes to be able to be efficient SEMICOLON we started to see the increased turn as we stopped having to invest in branches because we're happy with the distribution and it will start to come down next year.
6;51;216;3;0.013888888888888888;so everything that i talked about in terms of expenses going down is all on a dollar basis, not an efficiency ratio basis, so we're absolutely expecting dollars to come down after 2014 in the business. with respect to the new branches, i mean we said like there's a third of our branches that are less than 10 years old, and about 11% less than 3 years old, so we have a lot of branches in the deposit gathering phase. and deposit margins are relatively flat, so at the moment we've reached the point where volume is out, is providing support to nii, but not strong growth until we start to see rates continue to rise and be able to reinvest up the curve as deposits investments mature. the underlying numbers are terrific, customer satisfaction, deposits, households, mobile, chase wealth management, small business, et cetera, but they are being squeezed by nii and interest rates and we've always told you we're going to build for the long run, which is that will recover one day and you will see spreads go up in this business. and when that happens it happens, but we're not going to not grow deposits because of that. and that will also affect obviously efficiency ratio.
6;52;149;1;0.006711409395973154;yes, so as much as i would love to be able to take a quarter that looks like this and say we could expect more of the same, the reality is we still have issues open in front of us. we still have large reserves and we still are working through them. so we've been clear that while we can not predict legal expenses, we do expect them to be lumpy, and for every zero or close to zero quarter, we could have a quarter that has several hundred millions of dollars or more, albeit that it should trend down and abate to something much lower over time. so i do not think you can read into it that we're done, we're still working through issues, we're obviously glad to have some of them behind us and some of the bigger and most difficult ones.
6;53;154;2;0.012987012987012988;no. if you look at the customer flows, in every single business they are very good, and customer sat scores are up, investments are up, assets under management are up, market shares are up, credit card, consumer, deposits, that's all very good. so i would completely separate out this litigation stuff, and marianne, you all have averaged your own estimates for litigation i think are $500 million a quarter. by our quarterly models, it's about $500 million a quarter, yes. so make believe, i'm going to use your number, nobody else's, it's not going to be $500 million consistent. it's going to be zero, something else, zero to $50 million, that's what it is until it goes away. it's not going to affect the underlying business. and as you know we're also going to have one-time benefits from stuff we do not anticipate too.
6;54;24;0;0.0;we're growing share so-- clients go with their feet and they seem to be coming to our branches and our bankers. thank you.
6;55;80;2;0.025;so it's a little bit of we do not know where capital markets revenues will go obviously, and if they stay low or we expect to pass that down to the bottom line, it's also a little bit of there are sometimes positive and sometimes negative surprises and issues in expenses at this time every quarter, so there's a little bit of cautiousness in there. we're going to obviously do everything we can to outperform that.
6;56;95;2;0.021052631578947368;so most of the improvement in this quarter was associated with the ability for us to net variation margin on derivatives across currencies as allowed by contracts rather than having to only net in the currency of the underlying transaction. so that was obviously sensible that you should be allowed to net margin across allowable currencies, but that was not the provision of the basel committee SEMICOLON the us proposal changed that and that's favorable. that's driving most of it, there were other things up, down, complicated technical things, but not big numbers.
6;57;14;0;0.0;that's correct but i'm not expecting that in the very near future.
6;58;38;0;0.0;we're going to have to get back to you. chris i'll get back to you. i apologize. we'll get back to you. probably has to do with [awards], but we'll get back to you.
6;59;333;5;0.015015015015015015;so there are certain things which are secular. people who have gotten out of it -- i'm not talking about us per se, but people have gotten out of reduced dramatically credit hybrids, certain exotic derivatives et cetera, and i think there may be additional secular change. but it's not the whole business, so the way i look at the whole business is we have 120 trading desks around the world, we have 16,000 clients. and if you look at the fuel of the business, the fuel of the business is investable assets in need of people to invest those, whether it's corporations, individual, et cetera. those numbers will double over 10 years, they're going to triple in the emerging and developing markets. and spreads themselves have been coming down fairly consistently for 20 years, and that's called capitalism, that you're efficiently using capital. so i look at it as a long-term business, it will be a good business, shares are going to change, there will be a whole bunch of adjustments. and as you know, it can change on a dime, and so we're not, i do not look at the $5 billion in markets revenue and cry in my soup. i think it's pretty good business, and we have had very consistent performance. remember it's driven by technology, research, sales, ideas, of course border flows, and last year we did not even have one trading day loss, which i consider really spectacular. so it's a good business. it will grow over time and it will have some secular adjustments. and i do not know about your numbers being right, the 13 of 17 quarters. and i also would not go back and look at the peak, the really peak markets of 2007 or something and i think you had some of that in 2009 and say that was a standard. i think that was a little high. higher than normal.
6;60;133;1;0.007518796992481203;i have an answer to your other question, i apologize for not having it off the top of my head. in the first quarter of last year, in non-interest revenue in card we had a one-time exit of a non-core product. so i think if you go back and dig out that transcript or have a look at the supplement there, there was actually a one-time item, so if we adjust for that, we would have been up more strongly. i might mention on the credit card business we have beta tests going of our chase net and you're not going to see it in the numbers this year, but we think it's a pretty exciting thing that we can do for merchants and customers over time.
7;1;52;0;0.0;so you got cut off at the beginning but you are asking for our earnings at risk on 100 basis point shift? within the first quarter, we have not disclosed it yet for the second quarter but it would not be meaningfully different. in the first quarter, it was $2.5 billion.
7;2;124;0;0.0;so i mean obviously earnings at risk is a representation -- it is an instantaneous parallel shift. if you look actually at our disclosures you can also see what a steepener looks like. so the way i would characterize the way to think about the impact of our asset sensitivity and interest rates rising is the way we described it both at investor day and at the morgan stanley conference which is when rates rise whenever that starts which may be in the second half of 2015 at the short end and the long end continues that over time that will deliver $8 billion to $10 billion of nii to the firm. but clearly the path to get there will be rate dependent and timing.
7;3;114;1;0.008771929824561403;this is jamie. i think on the funding side, we said we have met pretty much lcr and [sfs] and we think will be the [glac] or least we are very close to it. that is all embedded in interest-rate exposure which marianne gave you and that is our base case. obviously if the world changes, we may change how we go about and do that. but i think it is a very good base case to look at. we do not have any need to change it dramatically. i think you will all have to be prepared for the reason that rates raise -- obviously will change why people act a certain way.
7;4;136;0;0.0;i think we have to wait and see. i mean remember the united states has already gone beyond most other countries and they may just be referring to that that they intend to keep that or how they modify that. the way that we think about it, obviously we do not know how things may change in the future but between (inaudible), the buffers that we and other institutions are going to run above that with lcr and sfr, our own internal liquidity framework with capital stress pump testing under ccar under extremely severe conditions, it feels like we have a box around this and so we are planning to run the firm based upon what we know today with an eye on obviously listening to all of the things you hear. thank you very much.
7;5;2;0;0.0;thank you.
7;6;116;0;0.0;so keep in mind if the fed, whether they use repo or just sell securities, that will reduce deposits, so factor with it, absolute formula. the question is whose deposits and what kind of deposits and when they might do something like that. i assume they will be fairly careful. i think what we simply were saying is that some of the deposits will come out of -- nonoperating wholesale deposits already have (inaudible). some will not. some will come out of retail, and just people need to be prepared for. i would not put it in the earth-shattering category. just people need to be prepared and be very thoughtful about how they go about that.
7;7;50;0;0.0;i think we are very comfortable with where we are. remember, we are running -- lcr is an important measure. it is a regulatory measure. we are measuring it, we are reporting it, but we run the firm based upon our own internal liquidity check framework and what comes with that.
7;8;357;4;0.011204481792717087;really what i would point you to is the discussions that we had largely at investor day which was to say that we continue to expect the mortgage expense story to play out over the course of the next few years which will be obviously a tailwind for us on expenses both in servicing but more particularly in production. so that is obviously a focus in 2015 and beyond. we also are expecting to start on a journey to delivering. you saw our cbb expenses, cost of control investment are moderating and gordon outlined at investor day that the cbb business 2014 through 2016 as a relative matter would deliver approximately $1 billion of expense efficiency but the profile of that we have not been through. and then daniel is working through, as are all of the other ceos, the expense story in the cib and being as diligent as you would expect him to be given the environment. but one of our positions has always been that we are running this business for the longer term and we are going to be smart about the actions we take on expenses in order to make sure that we protect the franchise but that does not mean that we can not and will not be more efficient across the businesses. so we have not actually given specific guidance at the firmwide level but that is the backdrop. i just want to reiterate that we always have a waste cutting like real estate, people, straight-through processing, vendors, things where we think we got a little sloppy, where we are located, but we will never, ever ever stop investing in straight-through processing, better bankers, better training, chase net, marketing, sapphire, ebks -- you know the new stuff from branches. so do not confuse the two. we will lump it in together for you. internally, no one goes to a budget meeting and says i get my expenses down by cutting expenses and the really important things we need for the future. no one. we are not going to run the company that way. we would rather earn less money.
7;9;8;0;0.0;including in that is paying our people fairly.
7;10;140;2;0.014285714285714285;i would say that it is a matter of good housekeeping that we would constantly be looking at making sure that we are simplifying our businesses where it makes sense to do it. but as a large matter, the macro matter, we are working through the things that we talk about, some of the things that you mentioned and there are no significant changes we've got 1000 foreign correspondent banks, we sold cwt, we might very well -- we sold rps. there are a bunch of product lines we have either closed down or eliminated and a lot of that is in the works. we put a light -- enhanced monitoring our other businesses and so we are well along the way but if something comes up that we think we should look at again, we will look at it again.
7;11;289;2;0.006920415224913495;the most significant revenue effect that is not yet in our run rate because the transaction is not yet closed is the exit of the physical commodities business. so obviously when that closes which may be in the early part of the fourth-quarter that would have an impact in the revenues both in the quarter and then in our run rate in 2015. we gave you a number at investor day which -- we should probably update that number. i can give you the numbers now. so at investor day, we said that the impact in 2014 on revenues would be a decline of $1.6 billion. just given the timing of the physical commodities deal, the impact in 2014 is going to be closer to $1.2 billion of which about $500 million is in our run rate already. and then when you annualize the things that will be complete by the end of the year, that 85% of everything is obviously going to get done. so once we close the year this year the impact this year will be $1.2 billion, the annualized impact that we gave was $2.8 billion and that is still our best estimate. the important thing is the four beautiful franchises, asset management, commercial bank, cib, ccb are all doing really, really well and this does not affect their ability to serve their clients at all. remember also just for the purposes of completeness, it would be remiss of me not to say that expenses are also coming out as we take those revenues out and remember these are in large part businesses that were not at this time accretive to the overall firm's returns. so important to remember that.
7;12;119;0;0.0;i think because the government is still buying a big portion of net treasury issuance and because they are doing -- going into the repo market and taking cash out of the system, i think that number maybe has gone from $100 billion to $200 billion over time. remember i believe that that repo can not be rehypothecated. so i do think some of those things that cause issues in the repo market, my guess is that will sort through over time. we do believe we see dealers reducing their books in repo and you have had a lot of statements about repo and collateral and capital against it so i feel things are going to sort out over time.
7;13;2;0;0.0;not yet.
7;14;224;5;0.022321428571428572;so i would say that there has not been a shift in sentiment but sentiment is better. it is still better year-over-year and better quarter-over-quarter. it has allowed us to deliver growth in line with the industry and we do however maintain, absolutely maintain, our credit risk discipline as it relates to the commercial space. so it is competitive. it has not been the case that we have historically been losing on price, it has been more on credit discipline and on simplification and derisking but --. i think marianne mentioned it but in almost every category of c&i -- i'm talking about on the commercial bank -- utilization was up like 1% last quarter, maybe --. utilization in commercial was up 3% since the end of the year. since the end of the year and you know, utilization is usually a pretty good measure of companies starting to expand and early on, it's receivables and inventory. you have not really seen it in capital expenditures yet and if you looked at us capital expenditures in total including big businesses, they are kind of flat to down, that will ultimately be the driver of real growth. so if you start to see that, you are going to hopefully see a stronger economy but utilization is i think is the first sign.
7;15;123;0;0.0;no, but can i just give you a number? i think year-over-year that balance sheet is up mostly because of money we have in the fed. even quarter over quarter, we've got these -- we have $350 billion or almost $400 billion at central banks around the world. we have an investment portfolio of $350 billion. we have a loan portfolio of [$700 billion]. we have already told you when they start to reverse, q3, some of those will automatically come down. so our balance sheet is kind of high because of all of this huge liquidity and securities in the balance sheet and eventually hopefully there will be more loans which are more productive and less just holding excess cash.
7;16;209;0;0.0;just to illustrate the point, if you are looking at the slides, you are looking at end of period assets that grew by $40 billion or so. if you look at the average, it was only [18] and we get a lot of volatility around cash movement at quarter end. so jamie is right, there has been a significant amount of our growth that has been deposits and ultimately found its way on deposit with the central bank. i would say against that, having said that of course there is a natural healthy tension now with leverage rules that we are clearly strategically optimizing the way we use our balance sheet and that will have a natural tension to keep the balance sheet growth if there is growth to be more modest. you are also seeing -- if you are talking about g-sifi, the big chinese banks, the big japanese banks and some other banks around the world growing fairly rapidly, hopefully -- eventually we will use our g-sifi scores a little bit too. and if we are right about the liquidity drain in qe, you will see a bunch of deposits flow out potentially in the second half of next year and see some of that growth reverse.
7;17;216;2;0.009259259259259259;thanks for the question because i want to make sure i am very clear. so in june, we did see an uptick in activity in terms of client activity but volatility stayed very, very low and there was no specific catalyst for it, no catalyst that would lead us to believe that that would necessarily continue. and as we have moved into july, it so far has been our experience that it has not continued at that level. so it is more our guidance in the second half is that the 15% to 20% and the 20% plus or minus decrease that we have seen in the first half, that kind of environment is the one that we are facing over the second half. now we are not guiding to a number because as you very well know however many trading days into the quarter and things can change so you are going to have to pick your level and we can not predict it any better than that. it is just our operating assumption is that it will stay at low levels for a while. we know we are going to be wrong on that but you all have to pick whatever you think. we run the company planning for low and hoping for better.
7;18;42;0;0.0;we are not giving a specific guidance. it was 20% in the first quarter, 15% in the second, that kind of environment. and the third and fourth are generally lower and it could be lower than that (multiple speakers) . normal seasonality drivers.
7;19;103;0;0.0;we called out the $300 million if that is what you are referring to in the cib because it in our view anyway is a modestly sized and nonrecurring item. we are not expecting to have similar items like that. we may have some but we are certainly not our forecast that we are going to have that kind of level recurring. so really it is just to give you a sense that in the quarter we absorb that number you choose that you will to do with it in terms of your models but we do not consider that to be core.
7;20;6;0;0.0;not at this time, not significant.
7;21;166;1;0.006024096385542169;so first of all, these are all the moving parts, none of them are materially significant so operational risk went up a little bit, growth went up a little bit and offset against that, we continue to always on board positions onto approved models, continue to develop our models and get approvals for our models so that we can have the most efficient rwas that we can have. and so we saw some of that. and also portfolio runoff so we were just giving you some color that flat rwa is actually the continuation of the work that we articulated at investor day that will ultimately drive it down to be closer to $1.5 trillion over the next 18 months. we are a little inconsistent upfronting all of the negatives we phased in. we are not upfronting model approvals we expect to get. model on boarding and stuff like that. there is some of that coming and obviously those need to be approved by regulators.
7;22;31;0;0.0;not material. they are going to run off over time for rwa and everything else is not material. they can be restructured. i think it goes to 2017 now. thanks, betsy.
7;23;104;6;0.057692307692307696;we said relatively flat. it came up slightly in the quarter, obviously we are pleased with that and we told you that we expected core growth for the year to be 5% plus or minus and at this point that would still be our best assessment. if loan growth does continue to improve and improves to the point where our core loan growth is above 5% then yes, we would hope to enjoy the nii benefit. but as we look forward based upon current rates, we will be flat with a little bit of upward bias is our outlook until rates start to rise.
7;24;33;0;0.0;sorry, john, because you do continue to have albeit that everything is a little bit less than it was but you do continue to have offsets against that in terms of spread compression.
7;25;12;0;0.0;yes, if market implied curve is in fact how things play out.
7;26;143;1;0.006993006993006993;so first of all obviously what we can do is guided and limited by what we have approval to do. but yes, we did articulate that we were going to likely back end our share repurchases as we build towards our cet1 ratio. you can obviously see we built towards that nicely at 9.8%. and then yes, obviously particularly in the first half of the quarter, our price was favorable and we did share repurchases reflecting all of those things. when we look at the second half without giving specifics because we do not give guidance on repurchases, we have the capacity to do $5 billion more gross over the next three quarters and we have a target to hit above 10% and we will juggle those two things together but that gives us the capacity to continue to do some repurchases.
7;27;38;0;0.0;we assume none in that. think about the msr risk management as we generally speaking expect our results to be close to home so plus or minus zero outside of any model updates because of our hedging strategy.
7;28;132;1;0.007575757575757576;so as much as i know and you want to hear it, we are not going to be able to talk about the specifics of what we are reserving for and we told you -- we said before that we had very little in the first quarter, we have $700 million pretax now. it is going to be this way for a while. we are going to have elevated and lumpy litigation costs as we work through the issues that you are aware of. and then with respect to mortgage, we have settled with a large proportion of our mbs risk with the governmental counterparties but we do still have some other civil claims. but we would characterize it more behind us than in front of us and we are working through it.
7;29;189;5;0.026455026455026454;on an absolute performance, so first of all two things primarily contributed to the better performance. we said 20% plus or minus. remember that really could have been plus or minus when you go back three weeks before quarter end. so with the better activity in june, so june was a stronger month every day on average produces stronger results than the prior two months and that helped and we did not have line of sight to that when we gave our guidance and when we affirmed our guidance. and then the second, i called out the market partner's shares, the ipo. we sold our shares post the ipo and generated gains of over $100 million which is a couple of points. and the var, i mean it is very hard to predict ficc. we are always reluctant to do it because somehow you think you actually know what is going to be the (inaudible) couple of weeks and the var jumps are around but some of that jumping around is really i think of underwriting positions, cmbs warehouse positions and stuff like that which come and go.
7;30;143;7;0.04895104895104895;what i would say, mike, is that what we have seen in the second quarter gives us reasons to be optimistic that we are going to continue to see growth at around those levels in the second half of the year. like i said, it is not that we have seen a step change but that we have seen generally better sentiment, generally better utilization rates, generally higher pipelines. the phones are ringing. it is across geographies so it just feels like the environment is conducive for us to continue to be able to add. we have been very successful in the business banking space and yes, we have reached inflection in card. so it is our belief that we will have strong growth year-over-year in the second half but we are still in the early stages of seeing that happen.
7;31;117;1;0.008547008547008548;it is not really a factor of people who are already income producing, locked in rates and things like that. it may very well be a factor for people who want to build new things. not on the commercial side but we did look at on the residential side there have been occasions we have rising rates and improving housing. so depending why rates are going may be the more determinant factor than just the fact that rates are going up. rates are going up because you have a healthy economy, that may be more important than just the fact that rates are going up. we have not done the same thing in commercial, we probably should.
7;32;144;0;0.0;for us what we are doing is being consistent on our credit discipline and so we have talked i think partly in the first half of the year about us not participating in some of the growth that others saw because we have maintained line as it relates to particularly structured credit structures and aggressive structures rather than pricing. and so we are consistently doing that. we are not changing that and our credit across products also mortgage, commercial remains broadly consistent, we are not changing that either. so for us we are just maintaining our credit discipline. but yes, it is a very competitive place out there right now across the products and so we are seeing a little bit of that aggressiveness. we saw it in the quarters running up to this. we still see it now although it is not worse.
7;33;115;0;0.0;i do not think we have disclosed that. it has not been a breakeven business over a long period of time. obviously has not earned much money in the last few quarters and we are still negotiating something. it could be soon, it will not be all of oep. it will be a part of it. and then part of the number of you see, because i think there is $6 billion of total private equity are all heritage investment that were made by jpmorgan chase and etc. before the bank one merger. so they are all eventually -- that $6 billion will be zero and that frees up what, $3 billion of equity capital effectively.
7;34;105;0;0.0;yes, just to be clear, the $2.8 billion if you go back and look at investor day was for all of our business simplification agenda not the physical commodities. i just called out physical commodities as being a, a big piece of it, and b, as being the biggest piece left to happen in 2014. so just to be clear on that. and then yes, the $2.8 billion came with expenses of $2.3 billion against it. we did not disclose the capital but when you take that into consideration it was at or below our cost of capital, not additive to returns.
7;35;5;0;0.0;actually, it is in fixed.
7;36;352;3;0.008522727272727272;we have not actually broken out specifically in that way but i can characterize it for you. obviously in mortgage production, the first chunk of expenses is truly variable meaning it is paying for production on a variable basis to the salesforce and then you have a bunch of what we would called semi-fixed costs which are effectively the operators, the people, the ftes. and then you do have true fixed costs which is the management, the real estate, the technology. when you have a very, very small market which i think you would agree a $1.1 trillion or lower market is very small, then it is hard with the fixed cost structure to make a lot of money in the mortgage business particularly if you are taking a hard line which we are on the types of mortgage product that we want to participate in. but over time it does not stop the fact that this is going to be a healthy functioning mortgage market and we want to be a scale player. so it is tricky in this kind of very, very small market but we are focusing on fixing our fixed cost base and trying to get out as much efficiency as possible. we've been spending a lot of time in that and doing deep dives and trying to figure it out and unfortunately this one will not be the end of the year. i think of it as hopefully by the end of 2015 we give you clear sight about how we will be making normal profitability there which may take until 2016. right and it has always been a cyclical volatile business and we had very, very strong performance over the course of 2011 and 2012 and into the first half of 2013 and we are now at that cyclical point, that cyclical low and we need a lot of things to happen. but trust me when i tell you that the fixed cost base is our number one focus or among our number one focuses and we are working very hard at it.
7;37;53;0;0.0;we are not exiting, just no longer doing it and it is in runoff mode. right. so we stopped originating new loans but we do have a portfolio of loans that we are managing and as they run off, we will experience all of the usual charge-offs, reserve releases but not exiting.
7;38;19;2;0.10526315789473684;we said it was driven by derivatives. cash out of prime brokerage did better. prim did better than cash.
7;39;122;3;0.02459016393442623;so just on the mortgage thing, we are giving up share but remember that we distribute a significant amount of the mortgages that we produce and in this quarter, we actually portfolio-ed $5 billion of mortgages so we are not losing share in (multiple speakers). so we are adding to the portfolio for mortgage at just a slightly different dynamic. we are outperforming on sales growth in cards so ultimately that will fuel outstanding growth that hopefully will be better than the industry but clearly it is modest at this point. our c&i, we are in line if not potentially gaining a little share but we continue to outperform in real estate particularly multi-family real estate and asset management.
7;40;1;0;0.0;yes.
7;41;199;1;0.005025125628140704;i think you called it well on mortgage. obviously the mortgage market and housing conditions outside of home prices are challenging and that looks like it is set to be a slower journey. but if you step back and look across all of our other businesses, when i talked about the underlying core performance drivers growing strongly, that reflects our strategy. so we continue to build and grow our businesses demonstrated by those performance drivers as well as simplify and address the control agenda and we are making the appropriate progress on both of those. and it is showing in our results. i mean a quarter where obviously there are some challenges to print over a 14% return on tangible common equity is evidence of the strategy working. if you go through each of the comments i made in asset management, we are investing in the sales force, we are seeing that deliver growth, we have record inflows, we are seeing international deliver loan growth. it is very consistent. you have not seen us give you a roadmap on how we are going to get from 7% return on tangible common equity to 14%. we are already at 14%.
7;42;205;2;0.00975609756097561;no, look, i can not over emphasize this. we do not run the company for quarterly profits. we make long-term decisions in people, systems, technology, products, services, stuff like that and a lot of things drive short-term profits but the profit you have in any one quarter relates to the decisions you made the last five years. and so we feel great about these companies. the big weak spot which we all acknowledge is mortgage and we are going to put -- we have got great people there. we are going to put elbow to the metal there, we are going to invest some more money in their systems. we've got some catch-up to do. we got caught in the middle of as you know wamu, bear stearns, origination platforms. but if you look at each of these businesses, they are all doing fine and we are looking at how we can grow them over the next five or 10 years and that is what we are going to do. i honestly mean it. i do not care whether fic is up 10% or 15% or down 10% or 15% next quarter. i actually think that is a complete waste of time.
7;43;150;2;0.013333333333333334;i think most of that has been done. so you have seen not all of it but the full effect of that in terms of which segments we are getting out of, which ones we are going to focus on, which ones we put enhanced monitoring in so the same thing in the cib with our correspondent banking. there may be more. we are always going to do good housekeeping and there are some clients we have had conversations with that are still on the books but they will be leaving down the road. but none of those things will be material to the future of this company. they may affect revenues a little bit in the fourth quarter or first quarter next year but that is not why we are doing it. we are doing this to protect ourselves, run the business properly, meet our regulatory and control objectives.
7;44;80;0;0.0;think about this, the core number, the reported number being primarily driven by the legacy mortgage and credit card portfolios so the high end activity that we have been talking about is immaterial in the context of that runoff portfolio. that is what is driving the difference. so we will continue to see that portfolio run off and as it runs off and gets smaller, it will have less of an impact but it has been a fairly consistent story.
7;45;197;6;0.030456852791878174;we have a large market share so while we may be outperforming the market what we see is generally a fairly good picture of what is happening. and what i can tell you is if you decompose our growth, you have still strong high single-digit growth in nondiscretionary spend categories driven principally in grocery and oil space which is not all that unsurprising but i think is actually instructive about consumer spending and inflation. and then if you look at the discretionary growth which is growing even more strongly in the double-digit territory, it is across the board. it is travel, it is restaurants, it is retail, it is across the board so consumers are spending very strongly in both categories. (multiple speakers) merchant processing we are growing at like 12% a year and we are investing more money, do a better job for merchants there and we have 35 million people bank online. i think 15 million who use mobile bank, it was 12 million or 15 million that use mobile banking. so you are going to see us extend products and services all of which hopefully will be merchant friendly and consumer friendly.
7;46;6;0;0.0;mostly merchants aggregating their transactions. yes.
7;47;1;0;0.0;correct.
7;48;120;0;0.0;yes, so our general longer-term outlook is our tax rate is 30% plus or minus just given obviously the pre-tax (inaudible) of the 2014 market, it will be slightly lower than that more in line with this quarter. (multiple speakers) i do not remember if you mentioned it, but in other, there is private equity which was close to zero and bounces around. treasury and cio, which was close to zero and kind of will stay there and there is other corporate where a normal rate would be around 200, this quarter was around 400 because of some of the tax benefits. think of that as going back to 200 give or take next quarter for your models.
7;49;363;3;0.008264462809917356;so of the $5 billion, $3.6 billion was jumbo, about $400 million was (inaudible) and then about $1 billion was conventional so that is how it breaks down. so mostly jumbo, yes, and we are holding share in jumbo. and with respect to the market share loss, it was principally two things. it was principally a strategy that we've talked about to do less in the high -- high ltv, low fico space. we priced to the risk-adjusted return that we see in that business given the cost of service the loans that default and that is what the impact has been on our market share. and then also the harp burn out, we were very successful in harping our loans over the course of the last couple of years. our borrowers who our technically eligible are no longer responding so we are seeing that burn out. the bit that is really truly the conventional loss which there was some, is really on price competition and we absolutely intend to compete on price. when you say high fico -- that is fha? so our fha volumes are way down and we've studied fha based upon the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that, we have lost a tremendous sum of money in fha. we are trying to figure out what we should do about it going forward. just to give you three numbers, we collected $600 million in insurance. they disputed $200 million. the government called that a fraud. we reimbursed $600 million to get out of the lawsuit because it was a threatening lawsuit even though in my opinion it was a commercial dispute between fha and ourselves about that. and the whole time fha collected another $1.8 billion in premium. so the real question to me is should we be in the fha business at all and we are still struggling with that. we want to help the consumers there but we can not do it at great risk to jpmorgan so until they come up with some kind of safe harbors or something, we are going to be very, very cautious in that line of business.
7;50;169;0;0.0;i think it has slowed down a little. it went down slightly i think. remember, you are talking about different borrowers (inaudible) so it might be something that was two million deposits and some start to borrow money but in general, you are right. so if you look at commercial just as an illustration of your point, what we have got going on is utilization rates in the last few quarters have picked up by 3 points. they are at 33% still much, much lower than you would expect them to be over time which would be slightly above 40%. but you do see deposits flattening out. in fact, there is a little bit of decline. it is not absolutely the case at this point that we can say people are starting to spend their deposits and utilize their lines. as jamie said, capex is still not really out there but that is what you would expect and in this business we did not see strong growth in deposits.
7;51;254;0;0.0;first of all, just to make a conceptual point which is we did not have a target for loan deposits. we were just trying to make the point that obviously as we think forward to the impact of interest rates on our performance over time, we would expect both a mix shift in deposits back towards interest earning and cds but also expect to see the economy growing and loans growing and that needed to be taken into consideration. so it was not really a target, it was just a simulation to start with that. but it was based loosely on levels that we have seen at least in part the cycle that we were referring to. and then you are right, there is a dynamic where because of ltr, we will always have a -- because of our liquidity requirements internally as well, we will have liquid assets that will be structurally higher than they would had previously been and therefore from a mix perspective, that would have an impact. but at this point given where loan to deposits are, i think that would be a high class problem to be talking about. remember there are some unused lines so there is not a loan on the balance sheet that still 100% lcr. so what's really going to happen is it is going to be done at the client level -- capital, lcr, commitments, etc, that is where you are really going to have to manage it, the capital level, the desk level, etc.
7;52;330;1;0.0030303030303030303;what we have seen a little bit of is trade finance cost have gone up, a little bit in municipal businesses and there you have seen a little bit more restructuring on the type of business people do. remember some of the repricing may not take place in the product, it may take place in the relationship because all products have loss leaders, etc. but we have not seen a huge amount of repricing taking place yet. i think if you think about --. i have heard some complaints by the way that some of the revolvers are smaller and shorter. it is not the price as much as it is the sizing. and then you have heard some commentary in the market that inventories -- bonds are lower and spreads will gap out so you are starting to see some of it but eventually -- i have never seen a business where the cost of goods sold does not eventually get priced in the business. it does not have to be priced into the eggs and the milk, it just has to be priced in the transaction, the whole bag the person walks out of the supermarket with. i think one way to look at it is to say while we are absolutely managing through this complex environment, basel iii tier 1 common still is our binding constraint at the margin, that is how we allocate capital to the businesses and that is the sort of primary lend that we are using to price. and what you are going to see, as jamie talked about, is that the leverage and lcr and other constraints including stressed capital are going to play out at the client level as we just are becoming more efficient at how we deploy our balance sheet rather than necessarily a repricing strategy. and ccar, we are pushing ccar down. to the extent we can, we are going to push ccar down to those things which create ccar-ness.
7;53;96;0;0.0;i would not hold your breath. some people are leaving businesses, some are optimizing decline levels, some are having strategic changes and it will happen over time and we are quite patient about it. we are in no rush. we're not going to try to lead it or anything like that. it will happen over time. like i said, you have seen it in trade finance, you've seen it in certain municipal businesses, you have seen it in -- and all the rules are not final. when the rules become final, people may react differently.
7;54;159;5;0.031446540880503145;yes, the improvement at the bank and the holding company was retained earnings, [pressed] net of capital distributions but we continue to work through all of the other initiatives we have to optimize leverage including compression trades and pair ups and the like. that is actually happening a little bit more slowly than we had thought just broadly in the industry. it still presents an opportunity, it is not the most sizable opportunity but we are diligently getting after it. and then with respect to (inaudible), we estimated clearly it is a complex calculation so we will be slightly wrong in our estimate. we estimated it to have a benefit for the firm of 30 basis points and for the bank at 40 basis points. yes, we would expect that at some point it would be ultimately adopted by the us regulators but that does not look like it expects to be helping our numbers this year or next.
7;55;34;1;0.029411764705882353;it is essentially cyclical. i mean i wish we could actively manage it down because it is positive (inaudible) calculation but the truth of the matter is it is a factor of activity levels.
7;56;7;0;0.0;we do not think it is significant.
7;57;166;1;0.006024096385542169;so cra, remember is a combination of lower and middle income mortgages so we will obviously try to meet those commitments. it includes how many branches you have in lower and middle income so we will continue to build that. it is a function of cdfi, like lending to small business or community development funds which we will continue to do. so it runs a whole gamut and we will meet our cra commitment. yes if you do not do in the fha, it hurts you a little bit but to do fha. lose billions of dollars that is a whole different level of shareholder responsibility and so we've got to be very careful how we handle that. i am hoping fha comes forth and comes up with some real bright lines and harbors to make it easy for us to try to do what the government wants us to do but we can not get penalized severely for some of the things that happen.
7;58;116;1;0.008620689655172414;it is all of that. we are going to meet cra. we report cra to our sellers every month and like i said, it cuts across a wide variety of things that we do for people and we just did this great thing in detroit that is a lot of cra credits. we can you mortgages ourselves that we can put on balance sheet that we think are less risky than fha insurance. so we will figure it out. we are just thoroughly, thoroughly confused about how we got treated, how we've got it going forward and we are kind of waiting for -- we have spoken to government for some kind of guidance going forward.
7;59;35;0;0.0;yes. it's deals and reps and warrants. it is the reps and warrants that there should be a commercial resolution of the dispute but you do not have [treble] damages if something goes wrong.
8;1;160;1;0.00625;yes, i mean, so, matt, i would say we i think -- and i can not remember which quarter it was, but several quarters ago we put a slide out in the presentation that showed what -- it was last year -- showed what the business simplification agenda looked like. i think if you go back and now look at what we have done, including what we were able to either complete or sign this quarter, oep, the rps business, gsog, commodities, we've certainly broken the back of most of the business simplification agenda. having said that, it is an ongoing process and we continue to de-risk clients and industries and continue to simplify our products in mortgage and the like. so i would characterize that the actions that we have taken by the end of this year are substantially all of them. but at the margin we continue to look at client by client product by product to simplify things.
8;2;192;1;0.005208333333333333;so, we have talked before about the fact that when you take into consideration a combination of the leverage and liquidity rules together with our own point of view on positioning the company for rising rates. so therefore our own point of view as being under invested in the duration perspective, that we have, we believe, a relatively optimized balance sheet. although it likes like we have a significant amount of cash, that is in part non-operating deposits that at some point will either flow out or be adequately paid for by the client return and in other parts is part of our overall liquidity. i mentioned that subsequent to the us lcr rules being made final that although we had been reporting previously against basel compliance in the 20%-plus range, so a buffer of 20%-plus. the us rules are more punitive in a number of ways, most notably that they look at peak outflows in 30 days relevant cumulative and also on higher outflow assumptions across the categories. given that we are not compliant with a more modest buffer. so we would say that we are largely optimized.
8;3;115;1;0.008695652173913044;so, the capital is relatively minimal in comparison to the overall firm. so while it obviously is positive for us, it is not a noteworthy number. and the expenses, just to note that i said the roe is limited over time SEMICOLON this is a business that was still being built and therefore hadn't yet reached a maturity stage or a stage where it was returning its hurdle. it will take a little bit more time to take the expenses out so there will be a slight lag in removing expenses. so in the fourth quarter it will be more modest, but over time it would be a large chunk of that $300 million.
8;4;120;3;0.025;yes. so we had a better third quarter than we had been expecting earlier in the quarter. we will see how the fourth quarter pans out. so, yes, it is the case that if we have a better fourth quarter and therefore a stronger second half of the year that our expectations for comp will be higher. they'll still be well within our comp to revenue ratio range of 30% to 35%, i mean you saw for the quarter 32% year to date the same. so in large part it is going to be based on higher revenues in market. this quarter we also had higher revenues in mortgage and also in corporate. so that is the principal driver.
8;5;2;0;0.0;yes, sorry.
8;6;294;8;0.027210884353741496;yes. before i do that, you had a second part to your question on the cost of controls. let me just deal with that very quickly. we talked about the fact that we expect our control cost to reach a peak this year, that is still the case. so i would say that they are substantially in our run rate by the end of the year. they will over time be able to come down SEMICOLON they will still remain elevated relative to historical because that is the new business world we are in. but we are going to be able to become more efficient, automate things, finish remediations, look backs. so over time that will provide leverage. in terms of looking out to 2015 and 2016, while we have not given specific guidance i will just point you to a few things. the first is we do expect to continue to see mortgage servicing expense decline on the back of delinquency and credit trends. we would also expect to see improvements in the production space albeit we are -- there is a reasonable fixed cost base. but nevertheless, as you saw this quarter, we continue to make great progress in resizing that expense base. in the nonmortgage space in the consumer bank, gordon has committed to $1 billion in 2016 over 2014 principally but not exclusively driven by automation and efficiencies in branch staffing leverage and also the branch footprint optimization. and then while we did not quantify it, daniel is very much looking at the expense equation for positive leverage that is reasonably significant over the next two years in the cib. so i would say across the board obviously we are growing in asset management, we are investing in our businesses notwithstanding.
8;7;56;1;0.017857142857142856;so at the beginning what i did say is that there are a number of masses in our legal expenses for the quarter, but in large part it does relate to fx. and consequently you can read into that that things are further progressed this quarter than last, but obviously we can not comment any further.
8;8;451;3;0.0066518847006651885;so just to talk about it, so we did $1.5 billion of buybacks this quarter, same last quarter. obviously we have another $2 billion to go in terms of our approval. we do not know what the rule is going to be, it will come out before the end of the year, we will have to see what that says. there will be a transition timeline, it will transition on the same timeline phase and timeline that the rest of the buffers transition in on, so through to january 1, 2019. so there is no need for us to overreact and race to compliance. so we would do much as we have done over the course of the last two years, which is balance continuing to make good progress getting to wherever it is that we need to be, which we are not going to get at at this moment, against the desire to want to continue to deliver capital to the shareholders in the form of increased dividends and repurchases. remember, you all have the forecast where cet1 goes up to 10.5%, 10.8% or something like that. when that new ccar rules come out we'll probably go fine-tune what it might look like at the end of 2015. yes, i mean the reality of the situation is sitting at 10.1% SEMICOLON we are in good company with the rest of the industry in the context that just given how ccar operates it is highly likely that there will be overall accretion to capital in the industry over the course of 2015 and we will be no exception. so we will continue to accrete capital up towards and potentially above our 10.5%. but we are not going to recalibrate a target until we understand the rules. and (multiple speakers) one thing on the target, just when you see the rules yourself know that in our 50 to 100 basis point buffer the reason why we had a range was to allow in part for some of uncertainty and things evolving. and so, we would obviously want to fine-tune and put a finer point on our buffer. so it is possible that our buffer may not be as high as 100% too. so we will deal with all of that when the rules come out. and we have also been, remember, very careful the purpose here is to protect and grow the client franchise, meet the regulatory agenda and then we will adjust to all of these changes as they take place. the big ones we're going to know by the end of the year, tlac, g-sib and new ccar. ccar, yes.
8;9;157;2;0.012738853503184714;so you would have seen our other where it came down slightly in the quarter from the second quarter on the back of model improvement and on data and portfolio runoff. so we are starting to see that bend now. it is the case that as we project forward to the end of 2015 the number that we showed you at investor day is still relatively good. it is probably a little higher than that. we said [1.5%] it will be support between 1.5% and 1.55% by the end of next year. we are not in complete control around the timing of model approvals. we obviously are doing everything we can to be timely and then the regulators need adequate time to approve them. so we have kind of been a little bit more conservative potentially about the duration it takes to get models approved. but we are still on that same basic trajectory.
8;10;68;2;0.029411764705882353;yes, i mean, yes, there is a significant benefit. if you look at our disclosures you can kind of see the short end versus long end impact. basically there is a significant benefit coming off of the short end. so we would expect to capture a significant portion of that in the first 12 months. but we obviously are looking for a more normal curve overall over time.
8;11;129;1;0.007751937984496124;obviously not to comment on everybody else's results, but our results were -- in terms of the size of the economic downturn, they were relatively in line. and our results were relatively in line with a few minor sort of enhancements to our process. so we were not actually looking for materially changed results in our midyear dfast. so obviously we have not had instructions yet, we are expecting them absolutely eminently, possibly as early as this week. in terms of guidance from the regulators on how to think about the bank holding company scenario for 2015 ccar, to the degree that there are more and more stressful idiosyncratic losses or stresses on leverage or other things it could have an impact. but we have to wait and see.
8;12;333;6;0.018018018018018018;so, mark carney of the fsb and the bank of england chairman said that two major things remain to finish kind of the too big to fail issues. one is how you deal with derivatives and the second is tlac, and both of those will be done this year. this is the thing, has been done, it is a great example -- i think it was 18 firms who got together and came up in a very complex way globally had to deal with this in a way that the regulators. and the fed put out a press release and mark carney has been very positive about it and it was industry led. so we do think it does solve that issue. so all of the buy side will do it. it will be -- eventually all the sell side -- i mean the other way around, all the buy side will eventually want to do it because it is actually better for the business as a whole. may be not better for one trading desk, but it is better for the business as a whole and it is a little coercive. so that the regulators are basically saying that to do further derivatives you are going to have to adopt these new rules. and we think over time a lot of people will do it. and just one thing there, the [ga] team does sort of break the back of the problem, but we are still awaiting actual regulatory guidance. so there is still the strong possibility that the guidance will be broader and we would encourage it to be broader, if nothing else for simplicity purposes, not necessarily because the ga team alone do not really achieve the results. right. and we're also in a position where even if the buy side does not for some reason, that we would be able to manage that risk over time and it would diminish over time because they're the short duration of the derivatives.
8;13;104;1;0.009615384615384616;yes, so, i mean, our repo business is, as you know, substantially client driven and our clients are very interested in ensuring that they are giving us sufficient wallets to allow us to dedicate sufficient balance sheet to their business. so in that sense we continue to see repo as a strategic product for our client and a scarce resource, quite frankly. so, it is obviously the case that as we understand new rules that meanwhile leverage rules have been for a while and we've seen leverage reduce in the industry overall. but we continue to have a strong and healthy repo business.
8;14;86;2;0.023255813953488372;we are okay with the higher margins, generalized margin rules. and if they go to kind of a tri-party ccp thing that will be fine too. and it would alleviate other issues at that point in time. yes. i mean between the ccp and i think the fsc even put out a framework last night that talked about cross industry including nonfinancial standardized higher levels of haircut that we are supportive of. so i think the combination of those two things achieve a great deal.
8;15;167;1;0.005988023952095809;yes, so, i mean i think, betsy, we would -- we will do exactly with this what we have done with everyone else to date which is overall we are only going to put our balance sheet to work and allow our clients to use it if the overall relationship over time pays us a sufficient return for that. we have the ability to do that somewhat methodically and so we are being very surgical and very strategic about how we use our balance sheet. but it is a core strategic product for many of our clients and they want to continue to be able to do that. so, yes, we could, i mean if you look at the numbers, however you want to cut them, there is -- within our repo business we do have a match book, we have inventory financing as well, we have client suites in our short-term wholesale funding. so there are things we could do, we just do not want to overreact.
8;16;290;4;0.013793103448275862;yes. so, i mean we talked before and you will see more over the coming few months about our own wallet and payment capability so [chase pay] and quick checkout where we would provide the capability for our customers to be able to have a much more seamless experience. also for merchants to have a lower abandonment rate and continuing with the safety and security of tokenization and other methods. so we are continuing to work on our own proprietary wallet and payment capabilities that will be piloted and then subsequently launched over the course of the next coming months. and then as obviously the case that we are out of pilot and in production on our end-to-end capability including [chase net]. so we are signing up merchants at a faster rate than we expected and, again, you will hear more about that later. but our ability to now negotiate bilaterally economics with merchants and provide customers with compelling reasons to continue to bring share to us is also something we are working on. so our basic philosophy has been that you, the customer, who want to be able to use your debit cards, your credit cards in a way that you want and that we want to make it available to you whether it is apple pay, in-store apps, other people's wallets, visa wallet, our own wallet -- all which will have benefits, etc. and as marianne said, we think that we can also be friendly to merchants with data, with pricing, with simplified contracts. so we are trying to make this an ecosystem that works better for everybody and is far more secure. i have customers on both sides and i'm far more secure.
8;17;392;3;0.007653061224489796;yes, i was just estimating it, i was taking a guess that it will double over the next four or five years. and i think it is fair to say, betsy, that what we are seeing inside the space, not surprisingly, is this relentless constant and evolving set of attacks and we need to be constantly evolving and constantly vigilant in response. so it is entirely reasonable to assume that we will continue to increase our investment over the course of the next several years and we'll -- so it will be larger and we will let you know. i should clarify that was quoted in the press not accurately because this is one area where the government and businesses have been collaborating really well. and for a long time of course all these government agencies -- and i think we need that because the government sees all kind of attacks and they have a -- they are a fountain of information. and then also the industry itself collaborates, which is we share information with other banks immediately when we see something happening. so maybe even if something happens to you, you can help one of your brethren avoid a problem like that. and then cyber goes beyond just yourself. it's making sure that all of your vendors you deal with have proper cyber control, that all the exchanges have proper cyber control. so this is -- we have identified this as a huge effort. we've been very good at it until this recent breach, which we are not going to make excuses for. we will invest any and all things we need to do to get it right. our customers are protected, which is critical, but we do not want these things to be happening. but it is going to be a battle. we have already seen a lot of very, very serious -- far more serious than personal data being taken where social security numbers, security codes, account numbers, etc. and we do think that unfortunately there are going to be some wins and losses in this. this is not going to be one of those things where it is going to be absolute and we do not want to be sitting here saying you can absolutely be protected because we think that will put you in a false sense of security.
8;18;151;2;0.013245033112582781;yes. tokenization will be more broadly used and that avoids a certain type of fraud, but not other types of fraud. so you have to look at each one of these things and say, what does it accomplish. and that certainly helps across the payment space, but there are other areas of vulnerability, obviously. and there is (inaudible) security about who came to what systems, when they use private computers with private lines as opposed to public computers from home. there are all these things we're all doing and we've had some great people come in, audit us, and this is one area i suggest to most companies, get someone to come in who is an expert at this. we have our own attacker system where we have our own people trying to get through. so we are always trying to look where we might have a weak spot.
8;19;160;5;0.03125;i do not think it makes it less attractive. for the one reason if you look at one contract that someone may have in one fund or someone like that yes, it may make it slightly less attractive. but if you look at the improved safety of the system i think it makes it more attractive. so, if people believe that doing this makes whole system safer, every institution will say well, on the one contract side i would prefer to have the optionality, but for the total i like the fact the system is protected and we have time to work all this out. so if the resolution works that is really, really good for everybody. i mean everybody would have preferred that there was a resolution process in place for lehman. the pain and suffering would have been far less across derivatives even though they did not have the same -- they had more protection derivatives at the time.
8;20;236;1;0.00423728813559322;so i think just an important point of clarification for what it is worth is that the fdic found the industry's 2013 plans not credible, the fed did not. so it was not a joint agency conclusion that point. and so, we have not had comments on the 2014 plan yet. having said that we, talking for jpmorgan, we made substantial progress even between the 2013 and 2014 submissions. we are in dialogue with our regulators to understand even more detail of what they found as being the limitations or the vulnerabilities in our credibility of the plan. and we are committed to remediating them by 2015. it has had little bearing on our business simplification agenda because it was already a very broad and appropriate agenda. but we continue to work on all number of things around the place, [crystal] operations, legal entity simplification and we will continue to do so. remember the fsb led by mark carney has made it -- be said publicly that the two big remaining pieces are tlac, which should be done this year, and the derivative stay that would be common harmonization around the globe. and those two pieces are going to be in place and make resolution much more achievable. right and we should add that obviously the [issa] protocol was specifically pointed out in that feedback and the industry voluntarily resolved the issue i think very well.
8;21;125;1;0.008;no. so i mean, my point of view on this is that while we have started doing the filing more recently we have been well aware of the requirement for a reasonably long if not very long period of time and have reoriented our business to be compliant in substance with the requirements. so the fact that we are producing metrics at this point is not having meaningful impact on our business. it is the case that over the course of the next year between now and the compliance date next july, we do expect to, as an industry, receive feedback on that data and we will have to see how that progresses. but it is our point of view that our business is compliant.
8;22;139;0;0.0;industry wide as people pushed lcr and capital and some of these rules down to the trading desk that we did see a reduction in inventories, etc. but our view is that market making is a critical role in society and it has to take place. we have 16,000 clients and so we really do focus on serving those clients. we electrified more of it, some of it will go to clearinghouses, some of it will be -- but we want to be there for the clients. and you will see how the industry sorts out. some people in the industry are making much more drastic decisions than others. our decision has been to be there to make markets and just try to adjust to the new rules which may make it a little bit more costly to trade.
8;23;126;1;0.007936507936507936;i think it was not the reporting requirements, i think it was pushing down of lcr, the cost of capital, the cost of debt and the traders reduced their balance sheets a little bit and they were a little more cautious how they use a balance sheet. and that is industry wide. and then some people said we simply can not stay in these areas. i have seen people exit certain trading areas. yes, i mean, repo is a good example of that where the level of, not concern, but the level of dialogue with clients around our willingness to continue to commit our balance sheet to that business has increased because others are less willing. and so, we are seeing some of that for sure.
8;24;128;1;0.0078125;yes, okay so let me give you the down piece of it. one of them is not timing, it is just a continuation of a trend where trade finance loans are down substantially year over year (technical difficulty). and so when you look at it the overall loan balance is being impacted by trade, markedly. and then on the client overdraft side, that is something that is a little bit lumpier, you see. so those two things driving it down. but the point to the comment was a little bit -- not to trivialize reported loan growth, which was still positive, but with those masking underlying performance in our credit portfolio and hfi loans. so our more traditional credit lending continues to grow and grow at 10% plus pace.
8;25;261;3;0.011494252873563218;so i think a reasonable point of view on that would be at the lower end of that range, at the 50 basis points. so remember, when we -- obviously we will refine it and we will update you. but when we have thoughts about having a buffer it is there in order to protect us from a range of issues including capital volatility driven by aoci. we regularly and routinely stress our portfolio to understand how much stress we could see in aoci in a short period of time and that is going to be one of the principal drivers. so i would say is that a reasonable sort of benchmark for the level that we would go to. that does not mean we have to have that buffer in totality. as i said, buffers phase in between now and january of 2019. so whatever we decide it is, however we communicate that to you, that as well of all of the other buffers, capital conservation buffer and g-sib we will phase in. and ccar may still be a limiting factor, so --. yes. i mean the reality -- as jamie said, the reality is that the way ccar is operating, while there has been good progress in the communication and dialogue with the regulator, the reality remains that it is still not clear, either quantitatively or qualitatively, exactly how everything is working and therefore it is unlikely to be the case that in this cycle that you are going to see 100% or greater than 100% distribution. that is my view.
8;26;207;3;0.014492753623188406;yes, so, i mean, just before we sort of get onto the business-by-business lens on it, i mean the reality mathematically is obviously true that if we have higher capital we would prima facie defacto have lower returns. but the reality has not been that way over time. so you know acutely that we have added significant capital over the last however many years and have been able to, over time, continue to reorient the business and optimize against it to deliver strong returns. so could there be a decline in returns. obviously we will have to see what the rules look like. clearly at the moment the most clear and present danger relates to higher g-sib surcharges on short-term wholesale funding. so in the first quarter impact of it would obviously have an impact on directing those businesses and products in the cib. but obviously if the company is holding more capital we will look more broadly. but i do not think it is a foregone conclusion that you are going to see a pro rata decline in our returns. and obviously we are continuing to focus on our expenses in making sure that the overall business is as efficient as possible.
8;27;176;3;0.017045454545454544;yes. so i mean our 10% roe, 13% rotce, remember the target is an rotce target. it's obviously -- right now in 2014 we are in a bit of a cyclical low in a number of ways and elevated expenses. so it is cyclical lows in mortgage, at least for the first half of the year cyclical lows and some secular headwinds in the market space. yes, we are reaching a peak in terms of control expenses, so that is in part contributing reserve releases are lower albeit that credit remains benign, but at a relative matter they are lower. but we are staring efficiencies in the face across our businesses over the course of the next two years. so control costs will decline, ccb will deliver improvements in expense, cib will also, rates will be a meaningful piece. clearly you've seen our sensitivity to rising rates is relatively significant, but it is not the only piece. when the economy generally recovers, when loan growth recovers and volatility recovers, all those things, good things happen.
8;28;189;0;0.0;just to talk about what will be included in ccar, the truth is we do not know. so what you have seen we have also read. but that does not constitute any kind of guidance. we have not received guidance yet, so we are going to have to wait to see that. it would not be entirely surprising if there was some sort of leverage stress in there quantitatively SEMICOLON i can not speak to qualitatively. and then, yes, there has been more stringent guidance on leverage lending from the regulators over the course of the last year. and we have taken a fairly strict line on applying that. so it has in part been one of the reasons why we believe we have seen lower loan growth in some of our business than we would otherwise have seen. and it is going to get a little stricter on the refi part of the leverage loans. and obviously whatever the terms are, we will meet the terms and some of that business will go to nonbanks or some banks who are not regulated by the occ and the fed.
8;29;68;0;0.0;it is still relative to 20-million-something customers in -- households and 23 million, something like that, households in the retail sales space is still relatively low. from recollection, and we will check the numbers for you, i think it is in that 2 million to 3 million range. but nevertheless -- no? mobile was much higher than that. mobile is higher? okay, we will get back to you.
8;30;40;0;0.0;i'm sorry, i'm sorry --. i'm sorry, it's 18 million. yes, it is 18 million out of --. 18 million. i do not know is that individuals or households? it's a huge amount. customers. yes, customers. sorry.
8;31;167;5;0.029940119760479042;look, again, our view is to, if you are a client and you want to use your apple phone to pay with nfc at a merchant, that is fine, we do not want to say you can not use your jpmorgan chase credit card or debit card. and like we said, we're going to be in other people's wallets too. and we're going to have our own which we think will have some competitive advantage. so will it cannibalize? sure. but we are not against cannibalizing our own business or disrupting ourselves if we are building a better business and are gaining share. our goal to gain share. we do believe a little bit in -- you know when jeff bezos says, your margin is my opportunity, we want to be the people that are coming up with the new ideas and stuff that are getting more of our customers using our stuff and happier. and if it reduces certain margins somewhere, so be it.
8;32;96;0;0.0;yes, look, if you look at year-over-year trends, they continue to be in the -- i mean i think the first quarter year over year was 4%, 8% in the second, 7% in the third. i think we are not expecting those year-over-year tends to decelerate. obviously quarter over quarter things can be impacted just by the timing of closing loans. so fundamentally i would say, no, we are not seeing significant deceleration quarter over quarter within continued relative momentum. solid across the board with obviously more challenges in the c&i space.
8;33;68;0;0.0;relative to the 58 plus or minus that [was being said], no, it is principally in higher revenues on higher market performance. we always said that might be the case. yes. so we are meeting our overhead numbers and the comp itself will bounce around a little bit. remember, in the old days we used to break out ib comp in total for that reason. but --. yes, sorry.
8;34;246;3;0.012195121951219513;okay. so just in terms of what is our binding constraint at the moment, it is cet1, so basel iii advanced capital, risk-based capital at the margin. so it is not to say that the other ratios leverage liquidity and the like are not [comfortably] around it. but that -- and even stress capital. but that is currently our binding constraint. it is very hard for us to give us a point of view where you should do this new model three years out when we are staring potentially new rules in the face in the next two months. as i said earlier, we are expecting over the course of the next 12 months that we will continue to accrete capital at 2% or above our 10.5% which is basically in-line with what you guys all have in your models. beyond that it is our expectation that, hopefully anyway, putting new rules aside that by the time we are in our fourth or fifth cycle of ccar when you've made substantial industry wide progress in the sort of non-quantitative aspects of ccar where we have more credible resolutions and the like that we will be able to me more aggressive in our ability to seek capital distribution capability. so outside of any changes in rules we would hope at the end of 2015 into 2016 ccar to be able to have -- payout ratios are much higher. but we will have to see.
8;35;66;0;0.0;yes, there is. so about half of that i would call -- approximately half of that i would call relatively normal, but included in that result there is actually a one-time item associated with accounting for the previous interest accrual that we released in the quarter, which is one time. you should expect that interest expense to go back up next quarter to something more normal.
8;36;6;0;0.0;a little less than $100 million.
8;37;124;5;0.04032258064516129;yeah. so i think -- yes, it is our -- it is our belief that we should be able to manage the ratio to be stable to improving over time, ultimately getting down to something much more in the mid-50%, but that is dependent on revenue growth associated with rates but not limited to rates. so in the absence of rate but, by the way just to point out, that it is still our case that based upon continued improvement in the domestic rate economy that rates will start to rise in the middle of next year. but having said that, even without rates we would hope to be able to continue to maintain the discipline to have that ratio be broadly flat to down.
8;38;202;0;0.0;so since we talked about the $100 billion estimated deposit outflows associated with liquidity draining out of the system, remember that was predicated on believing that it was possible that the fed would use the reverse repo program much more -- in much more size than is likely to be the case today for two reasons. one is that obviously they have made changes to the term deposit facility that allows them to now be lcr eligible, which is helpful in terms of providing another tool in their toolkit. and the second is that in september, as you know, the rrp was capped in total at $300 billion. that cap may or may not be permanent. i'm sure it will be recalibrated over time. but it looks like it will be unlikely to reach the $1 billion that would have driven the $100 billion -- the $100 billion -- sorry the $1 trillion that would have driven the $100 billion. so. you can make your decision about whether it is $300 million or $500 million in the fullness of time and scale our operating deposit outflows back relative to that, knowing of course that it is already in operation at $300 billion right now.
8;39;55;0;0.0;yes, brennan, we have not disclosed that. i would -- a large chunk of it is client driven, that is what we will say. a large chunk -- a larger chunk of it -- the larger chunk of it. we have also lengthened the firm financing part of it --. yes. -- to be more compliant with lcr, etc. right.
8;40;174;2;0.011494252873563218;so i would square it in two ways. the first is already did have a better performance in the third quarter then would have been anticipated in our previous guidance given that that guidance was given during the sort of harder times of the second quarter. so that is already in our run rate so to speak in terms of the comp that would accrue to that. and then if you sort of go back and, in the fullness of time, look at the transcript, i did say if the performance continues into the fourth quarter. so it will depend. we have always said, and evidently maybe we should strip out comp from our adjusted expenses. but we have always said that the adjusted expense absolute number in any period is obviously going to be calibrated to the performance of the market-related businesses. and clearly you would wave in good revenues every day at a 32% comp to revenue ratio. so that is really all we were saying, nothing more subtle than that.
8;41;37;0;0.0;no, no, it is not possible to talk about it in any more detail, i am afraid. it's just -- suffice to say that we are working with a number of regulators across a number of jurisdictions.
8;42;276;6;0.021739130434782608;so you are right that when you roll forward beyond the first 12 months you do get the benefit of being able to continue to reinvest deposits as they mature up the curve in terms of their invest -- the underlying investment. so that is the compounding effect of what you are seeing in our earnings and risk shock. but what we showed i think in -- i'm going to cease to recall it, but maybe it was in the barclays conference in 2013 -- is that you would expect once rates start to rise, if they rise in a somewhat expected fashion. so obviously it depends on what rate [party] you want to put on that, that you could expect the cumulative nii to be in our [impact] in three to four years. remember the benefit is more for the first hundred, a little bit less the second hundred, a little bit less the third hundred, a little bit less the fourth hundred, because there is increasing repricing of deposits at that level. and we do not know exactly what the yield curve will be four years out, but --. right. and also we do embed in that our own estimates of competition and repricing. yes. but --. yes. that is a very good point actually, brennan. our scenario does contemplate not only a more normal loan to deposit ratio, more normal interest bearing versus non-interest-bearing deposit and also a higher (inaudible) on retail deposits just given the lcr competitive dynamics, technology advances and the like. so to the best of our ability we've tried to bake that in and that is included in our number.
8;43;347;2;0.005763688760806916;right. so the deposit -- so in part not totality, in part the deposits that were likely to outflow through the rrp were non-operating deposits. and non-operating deposits we do not count for significant liquidity value in the firm SEMICOLON we fundamentally have them on deposit at central banks at the fed. and so, if they stay -- we will come back to whether we would be willing to let them stay, but if they stay they will continue to basically be treated in that way. and they are not included in terms of our assumption around asset sensitivity and forward-looking nii. obviously over time we are in the same way as we talked about repo we are looking at non-operating deposits for our clients in the context of their overall relationship. and so, that is another valuable use of our balance sheet with leverage capital and the like against it. and in the fullness of time we will expect the overall relationship to pay for that. but we are going to wait and see some of those dynamics play out. so other than that i'll just go back to the earlier comments i made that we do have a high level of hqla, not in [cash], not in securities, but it is in order to make sure that we have adequate liquidity both under our own stresses most importantly, but also under lcr and nsfr. and we feel good and at modest buffers relative to them. at the typical quarter end a lot of large clients leave a lot of deposits here which obviously are not necessarily good for us in terms of lcr or capital, etc., and we will be looking at how we manage those client relationships over time too. the other thing you remember of the securities portfolio is that as rates go up the duration of that extends on its own. correct. and so, we will be managing that. and, yes, we might invest it longer at one point, but we are in a very conservative position right now.
8;44;107;2;0.018691588785046728;so we are continuing to see credit trends improve, delinquencies come down, modification pipelines -- all the metrics are coming down. obviously they are coming down from a much smaller place this year than that were last and the year before. so the pace of improvement or the relative pace is slower. but we are expecting that to continue down through $500 million and into the $400 million's in 2015. and then just more longer-term, you know that we are focused on ensuring that through the next cycle we have a smaller delinquency portfolio. and so, a more normal level would be substantially less than this.
8;45;7;0;0.0;sorry, that is a longer-term view.
8;46;101;1;0.009900990099009901;yes. so i mean we talked last quarter about the fact that we had loss share, a combination of things, primarily our strategy around the government mortgage space but also a little bit of share in the what i would call in our target segment. so we have made that back. so in some part it is just continue to leverage our balance sheet properly, do very granular marginal pricing to really focus on changing and improving our customer operating processes. so across the board we just continue to get very granular and try and be as competitive as we can.
8;47;167;0;0.0;so, just to be very clear, it may be slightly -- (inaudible) slightly higher than investor day in terms of our guidance. so, look, obviously any guidance that we give you, and no good deed goes unpunished, but any guidance we give you is always predicated on based upon what we know today. and so, if something changes that would change that point of view we will obviously have to recalibrate it. but just prima fascia having the requirement to have extra long-term debt or loss absorbing capital and/or capital would not necessarily prima fascia change the overall rwa we have. i mean you have to be careful to ensure that by having higher levels of capital there's not an incentive to want to stretch in the credit box, but we have very tight credit discipline. so i would not see that being a material change in the outlook. but obviously if there is a change in rules that directly affect rwa that would do.
8;48;99;3;0.030303030303030304;yes, i mean, look, it is the case that a lot of refinancing has already happened, so the debt maturity wall is smaller, although rates are lower than we may have expected at this point in time. so i would -- so, therefore yes, it is reasonable to assume that there is going to be some continued headwinds. but having said that, i think there is going to be windows of opportunity. so we are going to -- m&a and ecm are more constructive and likely to be buoyant, but i think debt capital market still has windows of opportunity.
9;1;196;1;0.00510204081632653;so, betsy, obviously two things. the first thing is that the most important time period when this is going to matter is when it's in full compliance and through the transition period in 2017 and 2018. so the result in the 450 bucket as we understand it is based on 2013 results, so we have to work over the course of the next three years to make sure we are maximizing every basis point of g-sib and every dollar of capital to the fullest extent to deliver returns. so rather say that to move down a bucket, just in general terms, is a fairly significant thing to do just given the types of things that are driving the overall score, but we're not complacent about it. we've worked in extreme granularity to make sure that from the very first basis point that we're certain we're maximizing the return opportunity for that within the context of the bucket we're in. so it would not be a trivial exercise to move down, but we're focused on making sure that we're optimizing the resources that is our most binding constraint.
9;2;223;3;0.013452914798206279;it's probably worth mentioning that while we were in or looked like we might be in the highest bucket relative to our peers, there were peers that were in higher buckets and they are not constrained by g-sib but by ccar. so it's likely to be the case -- we continue to believe it's likely to be the case that you're going to see the differential in required capital for a variety of reasons not being as wide as might be implied by the g-sib. and so the key question is whether we're delivering the right shareholder value on the incremental capital, which we clearly think we are and can continue to do. and so it is a -- we are trying to thread the needle, as you say, about making sure that we are as focused as we can on maximizing the use of that scarce resource, but within the bucket that we end up being, wherever that might be, that our key priority is to deliver the highest roe and shareholder value we can, particularly in a world where others may be more constrained by balance sheet or leverage. so it is a fine dance and it's what we're working through. we'll obviously keep you updated as we continue to progress our plans.
9;3;1;0;0.0;yes.
9;4;7;0;0.0;yes, 50 basis points or possibly more.
9;5;414;2;0.004830917874396135;okay, so let me start at the beginning, which is if you look at our basel iii advanced rwa on the slide, it's just a little over $1.6 trillion. when we were at investor day last year, we said that we expected to be able to provide reductions to that by the end of 2015 to get the number closer to $1.5 trillion on the back of model-related benefits, etc. it's still the case that that's the direction we will move in. whether we get exactly to $1.5 trillion or slightly over will depend on the timing of some of those benefits. but that's directionally where we're going. so call it from a little over $1.6 trillion to a little over $1.5 trillion and we'll give you an update at investor day. with respect to the assumptions, at the end of the day, we generate a lot of capital and if we need to comply more quickly than we intend to do, then we can clearly pull those levers. but we have always over the last couple of years had the approach of wanting to have a reasonable sense of urgency, but a measured pace to getting to where we need to be over the course of a transition period, as well as preserving the optionality to continue to increase dividends and do buybacks. that continues to be generally our philosophy and if you take -- i think i said this before. do not read anything into this with respect to capital asks or anything else, but if you take analysts' estimates for the next two, three years, take a $1.5 trillion or even slightly higher rwa basis, you can continue to add 50 basis points of capital a year, as well as have meaningful buyback and capital distribution capacity and 50 basis points a year from a little over 10% over three or four years gets you to the other side of 11.5%. so that's just an illustration of the capacity we have SEMICOLON not necessarily a commitment in terms of glide path, but that's the basis upon which we feel like we will be able to add 50 basis points this year, which is, on a fully phased in advanced basis, which is we think an appropriate glide path. and we have not really started to manage [e-sifi], which we're going to do too now.
9;6;113;0;0.0;john, she did not say that. john --. we're going to meet our common tier 1 with the buffer we think is appropriate and we're going to fill the rest of tlac with the debt, subordinate debt and preferred we need to. i think, john, if there's something you're looking at that we've confused you, i apologize for that. for the purpose of clarity, we expect to grow into our gsib buffer, which will be excluded from tlac with common equity and whatever the gap may be when the rules are finalized on tlac, somewhere between nothing and something more meaningful, that's likely to be in debt issuance.
9;7;9;0;0.0;i apologize. we'll take a look at that.
9;8;80;1;0.0125;so guy, what the reserves that we have taken in the quarter represent is our best estimate based upon facts and circumstances as we know them at the end of the quarter with respect to ongoing dialogue and investigations, but they are not concluded. so as much as we would like to, we can give you no assurances with respect to the final conclusion and that's really all we can say about where we are on the fx matter.
9;9;305;2;0.006557377049180328;just one quick thing on nim before i talk about expenses. we do not manage to nim. nim can be reasonably volatile purely as a feature the amount of cash that we have on our balance sheet. what you saw this quarter in terms of nim, which was a 5 or 6 basis point decline, whether you are looking at firm or core, is in very large part driven by incremental cash balances of close to $50 billion. which (inaudible) there for days. right. some of which is there for days, some of which is accretive from an nii perspective, albeit modestly. so i think the more important measure, for us anyway, quarter-over-quarter is that our nii was flat, but flat and then just in terms of the flattening yield curve, we are more geared towards a short-end rates move and we're still expecting that to happen in the second half of the year. and so what really matters for us is fed funds rate notwithstanding the overall yield curve. with respect to expenses, yes, we will give you more updates at investor day, but i can continue to reiterate what we've said in the past, which is we would continue to expect to push our adjusted expense absolute dollars downwards over the course of the next several years and in combination with hopefully an improving economy and better interest rates move towards the 55% plus or minus, but 55% overhead ratio over the medium term. so you should expect our adjusted expenses in 2015 to be down, but we continue to have, albeit that we've reached a peak in the second half of the year, we continue to have elevated cost of controls and some of that leverage will be more in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015.
9;10;171;3;0.017543859649122806;so a little bit of what's driving the efficiency ratio in the second half versus the first half is seasonality in revenues and year-on-year revenues were down slightly. so obviously it's a little bit elevated relative to a 59% to 60% ratio, but obviously the absolute dollars are on a downward trend. hopefully what we're going to see in combination over the course of the next year or two is we will continue to look at efficiency in our control spend. as i say, we're going to be looking at that in 2015 relative to the exit 2014 rate, but you're going to see more of that leverage in 2016 and 2017. we'll continue to bring mortgage costs down, cost within the branches down, but offsetting against that hopefully we'll have stronger performance in some of our businesses and show some expense growth. so overall trending down, but revenues are part of the story and they were down slightly year-on-year.
9;11;32;1;0.03125;so mike, we'll give you the lowdown of that at investor day. you will see absolute reduction in dollars and we'll give you the outlook for the efficiency ratio then.
9;12;84;0;0.0;so i would say a bit of both actually. so obviously, as you articulate, we do see seasonality, but we did reach an inflection point during the year where we're starting to see a little bit more demand anyway for credit extension, but i would say our outlook for credit card outstandings growth for 2015 is modest, low single digit growth, not higher than that. so a little bit of both, but we are flattered by seasonality in terms of the fourth quarter.
9;13;192;6;0.03125;so jpmorgan, taking it in three pieces, yes, we think it's very good for the consumer on balance and also for the economy on balance despite the strengthening dollar, so we think that the consumer spend, consumer even credit extension is likely to be positive as a result. from a trading perspective, there are pluses and minuses. the oil price volatility contributed to the softer quarter in the credit space, but was helpful as it related to the current season commodity space. so in fact, net-net neutral to maybe even slightly favorable. and then with respect to our traditional credit exposure to the sector, it's about 5% of our overall credit exposure. it's well secure, top of the capital structure where it's a name-by-name analysis that we do and we feel comfortable with where we are right now. it's a cyclical business and we're expecting downgrades, but we're not facing any meaningful issues in the face right now. but overall, oil a reasonable positive for the economy and consumers, so for jpmorgan from a financial perspective a modest issue, possibly more negative.
9;14;675;12;0.017777777777777778;so first of all, i dispute the fact that some investors -- some people wrote about it as a possibility because of excess capital and it's true SEMICOLON you have to hold more capital, all things being equal, it will reduce your returns. but even the people who wrote about that talk about the superior franchises, the benefits of synergies, the good things the company brings to bear. so the first way to look at a business first and foremost has been and always will be what you do for customers, not what you do for yourself and your own returns, etc. and on the customer franchise in every business we're gaining share. we have good returns, we've got good marketshares, we've got good customer sat levels. the synergies are huge, both expense and revenue synergies, etc. and some, not all, disappear under the various schematics of a breakup or something like that, but that's number one. and the question is now you are burying extra capital, how bad is that relative to that. and for the most part, we've been able to manage that. we've talked about products repricing and managing g-sifi and managing ccar and managing lcr and managing slr and we're going to maintain the franchise, manage it and we still think we can get good returns. there's a point at which the capital drag would be so high that you may want to consider alternatives, but just remember they are not simple. like anything you do, every company will have to have cash management, global trade ability, every company general ledgers and hr things and data centers and nerve data centers and cyber security and it is not that simple a process. but so far, the company has earned good returns in all those businesses throughout this crisis and i'm going back 2010, 2011, 2012 and that's a sign of stability. in fact, even mike mayo had a report, which there is a slide in it that shows the volatility of returns and that we were among the lowest with the better returns. so that is proving it. the model works from a business standpoint and yes, we'll have to carry more capital and we'll manage that over time. erika, just to add to that, we're still in a period of flux as it relates to broadly rules, not just capital rules and we're in a period of flux as it relates to the competitive environment and it would be, for us, it would be premature to take big strategic decisions that we do not think would add shareholder value in what is a very challenging influx and cyclical low for the environment. so we preserve optionality. we think we're generating significant shareholder value, significant synergies and any discount could erode regardless. and remember the capital stuff is not an element -- what they are doing now is not a sign of riskiness SEMICOLON this company has been a fortress company, it has delivered declines and its diversification is the reason why it's had less volatility of earnings and was able to go through the crisis and never lost money ever, not one quarter. so in the real-life crisis, we did fine and in any future crisis, we're going to do fine. there are a reason you have big global multinational banks and they serve big global multinational, including governments. this company moves $6 trillion to $10 trillion a day SEMICOLON you're not going to do that as a small bank and you're not going to syndicate out of a $20 billion bridge loan and you can not do certain things globally in 20 countries if you are not in 20 countries. so you've got to figure out what model you have and does it make sense and it's not necessarily comparable to all other companies. so our model makes sense because you've seen the returns in it.
9;15;291;0;0.0;so you're right SEMICOLON the complexity bucket does stick out. just for what it's worth, we're looking at each bucket and we're looking at it at a very granular level because obviously we need to look at the whole thing in combination and the complexity bucket -- jamie said it i think earlier. if he did not, i'll just repeat it. otc derivative notionals drives a large chunk of it. clearly, we're going to do everything we can in terms of netting and housekeeping and everything to reduce that. but to reduce that meaningfully is to have a meaningful impact on our client flow business. level 3 assets is the second piece and obviously to the degree that those things are -- by definition, they are less liquid and so as a result --. but that does not make them bad. that does not make them bad. they are just less liquid and as a result, we obviously will take a look at whether or not there's opportunity to reduce that. but, again, it's also relative to market size and then, finally, our afs portfolio, which to have that in a complexity bucket is not intuitive to all of us and over time that may reduce but right now it's a very core part of how we think about structuring the interest rate risk management of our balance sheet. so we're going to look at it, but we're going to get very, very granular and there's no silver bullet. i would guess that over years we can drive it down without damaging the franchise. right. it's about looking at the first 10, 20 basis points, not the last 3 or 4.
9;16;3;0;0.0;you mean commercial?
9;17;430;4;0.009302325581395349;so our exposures are about $46 billion, about 5% of our traditional credit portfolio. about 70% of it is investment grade, about two-thirds of it is in the sort of cib, so these are large, well-capitalized companies. the other third is in the commercial bank. name by name, we understand what that looks like. these are asset-based loans, top of the capital structure, names we know and we're going to see downgrades and we're not suggesting that there is not going to be some stress and we do not know where oil may bottom, but, yes, we do have reserves. we have reserves that are based upon a long history of data that includes cycles. we've seen cycles before like this and so we'll take downgrades, maybe we may need to take more reserves, but it does not feel like it's a very significant issue or an imminent series of charge-offs right now. for us. there will be companies that are more invested in oil that may have different issues and then there's a secondary effect, which obviously you all can predict like russia, venezuela. so russia, we have exposure SEMICOLON venezuela, virtually none and other countries. and then there's another secondary effect. as you talked about, commercial or even consumer real estate in dallas, denver, houston, as you saw in 1986 and 1989 and those are all slight negatives, but not again -- for us, they are not going to be material. we're very well-diversified and for us, you have the other side. in general, consumer credit would be better not worse and you can argue and i do not want to spend too much time on it that even retail would be better. there are a whole bunch of other beneficiaries of this change of credits. so some will be worse and some will be better, so net-net for us, it's not that big a deal. it's a perfectly legitimate thing for you all to be concerned about for companies, which are very concentrated in oil or even commercial real estate companies concentrated in oil areas. that's not something that we need to worry about. but we're watching it closely. to jamie's point, we're paying attention to our real estate portfolios in those geographies, so there's going to be overall sector and geographical differences to how this plays out and we're paying attention to that. i'll give you an example of diversity helps. diversity helps. yes.
9;18;482;1;0.002074688796680498;on the first point, i think there's probably some truth to the less liquidity, but it's more about oversupply and lack of global growth stimulating demand than it is i think a liquidity story from a capital markets perspective. sorry, jamie, you were going to --? i would just add that when you look at -- i'm a little surprised that people are so surprised when commodities move like this. commodities have moved like this my whole life and obviously there's supply and demand imbalance and marianne mentioned that the united states supply has gone up by 5 million barrels a day over the last five or six years. people were a little surprised at the production that was positive out of libya and iran and iraq and some other places. a lot of people need oil revenues, but the other thing that surprised people was the slightly increased demand. i say slightly out of china and some other places and the other one that surprised people is opec. instead of opec making some kind of move to reduce supply, they did not. but, to me, all commodities have had that kind of volatility and oil has had even more volatility, so in the oil business, you've got to prepare for something like that. that is the way it's going to be and that's the way it's going to be for the rest of your life and yes, speculations, inventory and all those things may affect it in the short run. remember there is a fulcrum point at which oil, the marginal dollars that are going to be produced and i think our economists say it's about $75 oil, deep drilling in the gulf of mexico and around the world and one day it will recover to that because the world still will use more oil and need more oil, etc. and in the meantime, you've got to manage around the volatility and i do not think any of that had to do with trading, none of it. it had to do with fundamental supply/demand imbalances and people getting prepared for it and taking views on -- and not us. i mean i'm talking about oil companies and you've read about countries who've hedged it and countries who did not and companies who hedged it and companies who did not and i think it is a legitimate concern about liquidity in markets that when we have volatile markets or violent markets how much liquidity will remain, but i think there you're talking more about -- what you saw a little bit in treasuries, but more about credit and it's possible SEMICOLON we just do not really know. we're a little worried about it, but we will be there hopefully making healthy margins for our clients when the time comes.
9;19;410;1;0.0024390243902439024;obviously, we need to get clear on what the final rules and calculation looks like, but i do not see it being a blanket number. i think it's pretty evident that it's intended to be at least measured relative to the size -- it's the one measure that's not measured relative to a marketshare, but relative to the size of your operation. so consequently, depending upon how the math works out, it could be a differentiator for other people. but my comments were not necessarily driven by whether or not somebody else was going to be more punitive, more penalized by short-term wholesale funding, but by the fact that gsib has not been and is unlikely to be the binding constraint for some of our competitors. for some of those, it's ccar stress SEMICOLON for some, it's leverage under ccar stress. and as a result, they already are running at or above the levels that may be implied and that may continue to increase. so here we have a situation where the transition period, the glide path is a four-year period. we're at 10.1 looking to put a glide path together that measures all of our objectives over the next few years where others are at or approaching 11%. so we will see obviously how that plays out in the medium term or in the short term i should say. certainly in the short term we have a reasonably level playing field. the competitive landscape is changing and we're working very hard to make sure we're maximizing the return on every dollar we have. right, and the reason it went from 2.5 to 4 was not because of short-term wholesale funding SEMICOLON it was because they doubled -- they basically doubled the number under a new methodology. and so -- and i think when you spoke of 50 basis points of buffer, you were not talking about a short-term wholesale funding buffer, you were talking about a buffer over the required number to handle volatility. yes, so the buffer, yes, totally volatility mainly aoti-driven. the 50 basis points is the best estimate of what the short-term wholesale contribution --. added to it, yes. that is a gsib requirement SEMICOLON that's not a buffer. but we'll see. my view is it's not a blanket though, so you could see some people differentiated in that sense.
9;20;57;0;0.0;so obviously, if you get sort of granular --. we've moved it to 3.1. obviously if you get granular to different specific countries, we may have a different answer, but as a general matter, no. as a general matter for the us 2015 over 2014, we're calling for 2.5% and globally closer to 3%.
9;21;197;4;0.02030456852791878;it's a tough question to answer. we have seen some pricing changes in trade finance a little bit in prime broker, not really in credit, but i do think you're going to see some of it in credit. so over time, that's not because of jpmorgan, that's just because the market is going to reprice some of these things that are more expensive to do and we do expect that will happen somewhat over time. and remember, the other thing which is really important is we manage this by client, so you can actually do a better job under lcr, g-sifi, ccar by client and not change pricing, just change mix. so we're working 100 different ways to figure out how to get good returns for shareholders while doing a good job for clients. and remember, we have more options to do that. so whenever we talk to a client, they are going to want some of our balance sheet capability and they may be willing to do other business with you to make sure they get it. even if the pricing does not change, it might be good for us.
9;22;477;3;0.006289308176100629;so let me address the volcker rule in general. so we have accommodated the volcker rule, which we have to do in private equity and investments in hedge funds and marianne mentioned that we closed the sale of a couple billion dollars of private equity stuff and even the clo issue is a very temporary thing. the only question to clos is should people be forced to sell it -- they are all going to run off in three to seven years. so the only question the bank -- and that's not a material issue to us. we're going to accommodate that. the other thing that's important about volcker now is the remaining one, how it affects market-making and obviously there the clients are going to be concerned. do you have good market-making? there are all these rules around it. we're accommodating those, reporting client demand, aged inventory, different ways of reporting volatility and trading and now you have capital liquidity. so all the trading is to try to make it safer, but also so people can make markets and we hope at the end of the day that will happen. if there needs to be adjustments, it's going to be because you clients are going to say this is not working for us. the only other thing i'll mention about liquidity, spreads are the same in credit, but the size you can trade in is much smaller, which to me is an early indicator if something goes wrong you're going to have a gap out in spreads quicker and wider than you might have before. but at the end of the day, we hope to be able to be a good market-maker, earn a fair return for shareholders and obviously we got to -- we have to apply volcker and all the other regulations to it. and i think the thing to think about when you look at the comp to revenue ratio just for the purposes of clarity is that if you look at the fourth quarter of last year, excluding dva and fva, it was about closer to 26%, so closer to in line year-over-year. and that's evident when you look at the full-year ratio last year of 31% to 30%. so we're at the low end of our range at 30% but within the range relative to the performance and there was a big negative impact in the cib on a revenue basis last year with fva/dva. and i should say that we've always allocated capital to the investment bank and we've had sva-adjusted returns and stuff like that. so as you allocate more capital, all things being equal, that number comes down a little bit. so we've been disciplined in trying to do that properly.
9;23;186;6;0.03225806451612903;i think if you look at the 2015 dynamic, there's going to be three principal things. 2014 was a year of larger deals. 2015 has still got a good pipeline, so we're expecting to have a reasonably strong at least start to the year and probably a strong year and it's very driven in the fourth quarter and likely to continue to be so by sort of m&a-related financings. so the downside we talked about is just less maturities to be refinanced, but nevertheless some, but we're going to continue to have support from the m&a space, which looks set to be fairly strong in 2015. so you've got some puts and takes, but what we think is going to be a solid to good year in 2015, maybe not a record, but certainly a good year. and so jpmorgan maintained a number one share in global investment grade, number one share in global high yield, number one share in loan syndication, which we hope to maintain next year too and those are very powerful positions to have.
9;24;251;1;0.00398406374501992;so just, first of all, i think to put it into context, i think that the rwa growth was $12 billion, so nevertheless a growth, but not a huge number. a chunk of it was regular weight cda, which, yes, in part has got to do with just normal market dynamics right now as spreads wider and volatility higher, but a chunk of it is unrelated to that. as we look forward to the end of next year at 1.5, and which just to be clear i think i said 1.5 or maybe slightly higher, but nevertheless in the law of big numbers, the same trajectory. it's more at risk from just the timing of our ability to execute on granular segmented models, model approvals internally and with regulators than necessarily any sort of market dynamic, notwithstanding that that will factor in. so i would say the bigger risks to achieving that are less than the market pricing impacts on cda, but more the ability for us to get the right timing of those model benefits. and i think like two-thirds are models and one-third is runoff of stuff we know is going to happen. and the other thing, as marianne mentioned, the advanced where we're 10.1%, the standardized were 10.5% and yes, the advanced will change -- if spreads gap out, advanced will go up, but standardized will not. and eventually we think standardized is going to become the binding constraint, not advanced.
9;25;211;3;0.014218009478672985;so obviously, we talked about the card portfolio exits driving some revenue decline, also some elevated credit charge-offs. we've been experiencing, and i think we've guided to the low end of our 12.5% revenue rate range. we guided to that last quarter or the quarter before and at 12.2%, we're in that range and what we're experiencing is spread compression is largely offsetting the strong interchange and other fee growth from the volume, but when you acquire new customers and you pay the premium to acquire new customers that gets amortized through your results in the first year. so in years when you're net acquiring new customers, you will have a small net drag on your fees and on your revenue rate resulting from amortizing those premiums for the benefit of those strong relationships and the increased outstandings and spend sales volume you get in future years. so we've been on a journey for the last two years and we continue to be on it where there is some impact associated from the fact that we are net acquiring new customers, each of which we believe returns hurdle for us or more than hurdle for us, so is accretive over a period.
9;26;247;2;0.008097165991902834;i would not spend too much time trying to build this into your models if i were you, but it is quite clear that when you add $800 a year to the consumer's cash flow statement that consumers on average spend most of that and i think you're seeing it in spend and you're seeing it in car sales and you're seeing it in retail spend, you're seeing it -- and it's also quite clear it helps consumers, it helps their credit broadly. we're not going out and saying that we're going to reduce credit costs and auto, card and a bunch of stuff by 10 or 15 basis points, but i'm just saying you know it's going to be there. just like you know it was there on the flipside where people spent a lot of time talking about how much gas prices are hurting consumers and why sales are down at walmart and family dollar store, etc. this is just the flipside of that. and if you just looked at the consumer spending statistics, if you look at fourth-quarter annualized up 4.7% is the best consumer spend data since 2003. so it's already taking effect in consumer spend and disposable income is -- as you say, we're already expecting new car sales to grow next year, but all of this is going to support the continued strong trends we've seen in consumer.
9;27;133;1;0.007518796992481203;so you're right SEMICOLON we're close to lapping the acquisition cost dynamic not this quarter, but in the near future, but what you are going to continue to see is that we have a portfolio that is in runoff and as those loans run off, they were loans that were higher apr, higher rate loans than the ones that we're originating right now and as a result, you're going to continue to see some spread compression in 2015 again to which you're going to see strong interchange. so i would say, yes, ultimately and in the fullness of time, you're going to start to see the interchange growth outpace the spread compression, but for a period of time, they are going to be somewhat of a wash.
9;28;1;0;0.0;yes.
9;29;159;2;0.012578616352201259;so overall, the way to think about it is it's not ultimately going to be necessarily zero, but when you think about it in the context of the capital and the relative returns, it was not accretive to our returns, and so we have the differential between 500 and 300. for the full year, it's still not zero. there is a slight lag. clearly there's a slight lag taking out the expenses, but there's still an overall small net income impact, but for overall mutual to positive benefit on the return. and regardless of that, remember that our rationale for business simplification included a bunch of different reasons. it included activities that were not core to our core clients' activities that were outsized in terms of operational or other risks, as well as those that were not returning hurdles. so there are other reasons to simplify your business and they will have other ancillary benefits.
9;30;50;0;0.0;so no specific one-time items in the equity derivative performance. the uptick in var has to do generally speaking with higher levels of volatility than it does with anything in terms of risk direction. equity derivatives are largely japan and europe and asia. yes. the increase. largely asia, yes.
9;31;34;0;0.0;it's an example where volatility did actually help. if you look at equities in total, particularly in the prime space, there was a small one-time item, but not in the derivatives space.
9;32;39;0;0.0;it's not a significant increase in var, but, yes, you see increase in cpg var on spread widening and volatility, increase in equities. just year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we've seen an increase in volatility.
9;33;61;0;0.0;this quarter more than any quarter it's really honestly to early to make any comments of any note regarding trading performance, particularly given that the holiday fell midweek. so the reality of the situation is thematically nothing has changed from the end of the fourth quarter, but there's no big new news in the first few days of trading.
9;34;37;0;0.0;it was year-end cleanup SEMICOLON it had nothing to do with business simplification. and i think if you look at our revenues excluding fva/dva year-over-year, they are down reasonably in line with comp.
9;35;226;1;0.004424778761061947;i think they are two different issues. one is the correspondent business properly done is fine and obviously we do look at their credit underwriting because we've had a backup over the last 5 or 10 years. correspondents are no longer in business and if they did a bad job, we had to pay for that. so you want to be very careful and do business with the proper kind of people. we have reduced our share of fha loans just because the ongoing -- two reasons. one is the ongoing liability in the production side where the insurance was worthless over time and the second is just the cost of servicing fha loans when they go into default and they have a much higher chance of going into default than not. so those are two reasons to do less. and maybe that will change over time, but we're still in the same place in that. and just on the share gains, they are in jumbo and conventional conforming loans, not in the government space. so yes, we are competing aggressively on price, but with the right capital allocation and with the right hurdle and these are loans that are very high quality that we are willing to put on our balance sheet done with correspondents that we have confidence in the financial status of.
9;36;101;0;0.0;so the gse -- you could always get loans up to 97% in the government space, you could get it in the agency space with mortgage insurance. we've seen some movement from the fha on [gcs] and mortgage insurance premiums, all of which i think is intended to try and help credit availability, which we would generally support. it does not change our strategy, however, which is that we are much more focused on originating in the very high quality jumbo and conventional conforming space. but, yes, properly underwritten we will do agency loans in the programs that they have available.
9;37;224;0;0.0;yes, i mean, look, we have, over the last, i think, two years and a quarter, two plus years or so, we've seen an inflow of cash of between $300 billion and $400 billion on our balance sheet. so our balance sheet size has grown slightly over the course of the last several quarters in the last year, but the vast majority of the growth is driven by incremental cash and there's two principal reasons for that. one is as we have been looking to become compliant with our own and with us rules on liquidity, which we are compliant with at this point and have been for a while, that the other is also that we've been receiving increased nonoperational cash predominantly from wholesale clients. and so to the degree that that cash is accretive from an nii perspective and that we are not balance sheet or leverage constrained and it's a key part of the relationship with that client, that may not be a bad thing. but to the degree that it's not a key part of the relationship, we're going to be disciplined about trying to manage that balance. so i would say underlying that, we would expect our balance sheet to not be growing certainly not significantly, but cash can be the volatile factor.
9;38;83;3;0.03614457831325301;yes, we saw loan growth year-over-year 8% core, 3% reported. we feel pretty good about the demand for loans across our businesses, particularly those that have been performing strongly now consistently like business banking, like prime mortgage on the portfolio, commercial real estate, even auto and we continue to be optimistic about c&i and even card. so yes, we would expect to see robust loan growth into next year hopefully on the back of a continued improvement in the economy.
9;39;107;0;0.0;i'll give you a (inaudible) one for you. on the back of robust loan demand and rising rates in the second half of the year, which is our current central case, then we would expect nii to be up in the second half of the year, flattish in the first half of the year. obviously if those two things do not play out then that would not be the case. i'll let you draw your own conclusions on the rest of it. you're using the implied yield curve effectively, so if that changes then obviously that will affect the second half of the year.
9;40;749;4;0.0053404539385847796;look, unscrambling it would be extraordinarily complex and it would be extraordinarily complex in debt, in systems, in technology, in people and where certain things go and the businesses would start competing with each other right away, which i think is perfectly reasonable if they were all separate standalone. so look, we're very conscious of the narrative, which has become out there about this, but it is far more complex than that. the right way to look at it is we have these great franchises, we have a lot of time to manage through this and that is our objective, not unscrambling the egg. we're going to manage through it and we can manage almost every single part of it over -- think of over a long period, like five or seven years. do not think of over six months or a year. there's nothing we could not set a limit, drive down, sell, manage and that would probably be far easier than the alternative. even if it led to lower growth, it would not necessarily lead to lower returns. so just keep in mind that obviously we're going to do the right thing at the end of the day for the shareholder. it might be lower growth and better returns and managing through that and not doing certain things at all. marianne mentioned for example the amount of deposits we take in. well, it might be that we limit and restrict the amount of deposits we take in at quarter-end. we do it to accommodate clients, but all those nonoperational deposits go directly into the federal reserve. so that's what marianne said. we do it and maybe make some spread. if you can get 25 basis points there and you maybe are paying the client something. there are some clients which are not charged to take their quarter-end. they do not do enough business with us and we do not want their quarter-end balances. so we have a lot of levers, we have a lot of time and we are going to do it very intelligently over time. we're not going to damage this franchise just because of a current narrative. and the other thing i want to point out about the current narrative, which kind of surprises me that people do not mention, when you all talk about p/es and sum of the parts, p/es are temporary, p/es change over time and the real question you should be asking is is the e going to be much higher or much lower under scenario a or b, not just what is the p/e going to be because i could give you a lot of scenarios where your e is going to be a hell of a lot lower and that dwarfs the effect of the p/e change and the p/es themselves are temporary. jpmorgan is already earning its cost of capital and you're comparing it to p/es to a lot of guys who are not earning their cost of capital. meaning people expect them to have dramatic growth in earnings, which they will and so it's -- you've really got to have a much more forward-looking view of what p/es will be, what values will be, what earnings will be, what the franchise will be then just the sum of the parts breakup based on current p/es and false comparisons. some of the people out there that people compare it to they are not real comparisons. we are not in the same business with those people, but we are very shareholder-conscious. that's not to say we're not going to do the right thing for shareholders over time. we will SEMICOLON there are other ways to do it. and the other thing which i think is important too is that we compete globally. remember we have to be very conscious of who we're competing with and what they're going to do over time. and my guess is you're going to have some very large, very tough global competition over the next 20 years. they are not going away. they may have currently lower g-sifi charges, but i'm not sure that's going to be true 10 years from now. particularly the chinese banks get bigger and bigger and some other global competitors decide they want to be in the global businesses.
9;41;339;1;0.0029498525073746312;no, i would refer you to -- if you look at the 10-q disclosure from last quarter, that will give you a sense for the things that are outstanding. we will obviously update and refresh it in the k, but we're not going to discuss specifically all of the remaining cases. david, i think again i think the way people -- i know -- we know we cause problems with you all because we have this lumpy quarter-by-quarter type stuff. i would not look at this as a quarter-by-quarter issue. if you owned 100% of this company, the better way to look at it is it's going to cost us several billion dollars more somehow plus or minus another couple billion before we get to what i call a more normalized legalized basis. we disclose all that stuff in the 10-k. i think the rpl, if you ask me, is actually a fairly decent way to look at what those might be and we give you an rpl number, which is something that has not gone to the p&l, which is possible and we can not make something which is lumpy not lumpy and we can not make something which we wish we can bucket -- if we could, we would put all the reserves now and say we're done. we can not. it's a number and the important part as a shareholder is i want to deal with that, acknowledge our mistakes, try to have a fortress controlled balance sheet, try to stop stepping in dog (expletive), which we do every now and then, but build a customer franchise is the important part. when you have a market cap of $230 billion, i want to make that worth $500 billion 10 years from now. there's several billion dollars that we're going to have to pay for legal, so we want to fix it and it's unfortunate we do this to you all, but it's unavoidable right now.
9;42;174;0;0.0;so i can talk for jpmorgan very specifically that we are seeing the charge-off rate -- remember, we have had charge-off rates for the auto business that have been relatively low for an extended period. now we're seeing them revert back to something more normal and when we think about pricing the business and through the cycle, we contemplate a more normal level of charge-offs. so this is not as surprising to us. having said that, what we're also seeing in terms of just the broad competitive space is it's not irrationality necessarily, but longer duration, higher ltvs, more subprime originations. jpmorgan -- we are lower ltv than the industry and very concentrated on the near and super prime space. so there's part of that that we're just not participating in, but even for our own portfolio you're going to see some of those charge-off rates trend up to something a bit more normal, but that's how we think about the business through the cycle.
9;43;131;2;0.015267175572519083;i hate to say i'm confident about anything, but that's not our expectation. it's a very good question because of what we all went through in the mortgage game where subprime was an early indicator for even prime. but when we look at credit card, we do not think it's an early indicator of credit card. we're going to be very conscious -- as marianne said, auto did unbelievably well through the crisis, shockingly well we'd all say. so this is maybe a return to norm, but we're going to pay paying a lot of attention to it. and the loans that we're originating now, the very far, the right side of 700 fico loans with ltvs lower than the industry lower than 100%.
9;44;406;3;0.007389162561576354;i think, nancy, views and facts are completely different, okay? this company was a port in the storm in the real crisis in 2008 and 2009 and that was after we bought bear stearns and (inaudible). we had no issues whatsoever. we have a lot more capital now, we're more conservative now. we've got less credit exposure as a percent of the balance sheet. we've got less risk as a percent of the balance sheet. we've got more long-term debt, we've got more liquid assets. we've got more -- so it's even more true today. the fact is the company is an extremely powerful thing. people, when they talk about risk, they are just talking about -- a lot of people, they look at size and it scares them. i completely understand that. but that is not the determinant and i do not think we should be making shareholder decisions based upon views of people who do not necessarily really know. so if the regulators at the end of the day want jpmorgan to be split up then that's what will have to happen. we can not fight the federal government if that's their intent or maybe their intent is what it is. if you are going to carry more capital and you've got to modify your business model over time to carry capital, that one we think we can earn a superior return still versus other banks and carry the higher capital and modify our business model over time without taking drastic action. and remember, again, you've got to look forward in this. america has been the leader in global capital markets for the last 50 or 100 years. it's part of the reason the country is so strong. i look at it as a matter of public policy. i would not want to see the next jpmorgan chase be a chinese company because someone has to be serving the global multinationals around the world and all the things that that means about knowledge and experience and research and capabilities. so i think that if you look ahead 10 years, you're going to have large global companies who compete and we may have to be slightly smaller than we might otherwise have been, but so be it. if we can do that and do a good return for shareholders, we should do that.
9;45;58;0;0.0;so i will tell you that to answer the question maybe just slightly differently but with the same basic point that we saw an increase in cash of about $45 billion or a little bit more that $45 billion in the quarter and that drove the vast majority of the 5 to 6 basis points decline in nim.
9;46;380;1;0.002631578947368421;so what dictates what we have on deposits at the central bank -- for any deposit that we have that is excess operating or nonoperating that we do not think has any significant or any liquidity value to the company, on the whole, those are all on deposit with central bank earning a very small amount of interest income. and there is some passed onto the client net-net, so something slightly accretive. so that's what's driving the amount of cash, so to the degree that we have more nonoperating cash that will drive that. we are compliant with lcr under the us rules with an appropriate but modest buffer right now and that's based upon what we think is a fairly forward-leaning point of view about what true operating deposits really are. so as we think about what the cash is in customers' accounts that they really require to operate their businesses and no more. so we think we've got a forward-leaning point of view on that. so i think the rules are for the us final. i think our ratio for us lcr right now will be favorable for a period of time and then if there are any changes, either to the us rules, which we do not have any line of sight on or if we are required to make changes or decide to make changes to our own internal liquidity framework, that could cause us to add to liquidity, but that's something that we'll inform you of as we go through time. if you look at our balance sheet, forget all this rule stuff, we have almost $500 billion in central banks around the world. we have $300 billion plus of aa+ securities of very short duration. we have like $300 billion of repo and stock borrow, which is all secured in commodities by top credits with proper haircuts and stuff like that and with our capital base of equity capital of $200 billion, preferred stock of $30 billion, tlac of debt of $150 billion plus, our loans are $700 billion, which has always been the riskiest part of our balance sheet. and receivable is like $70 billion and so this balance sheet of this company is unbelievable.
9;47;106;0;0.0;so for financial institutions and nonbanks -- for banks and nonbank financial institutions, yes, we passed on the overnight rate to our customers and it's basically on their operating cash flows. it is what it is. all we're doing is passing through the cost. it's operating cash for their business so there was --. in euros. yes, in euros, so there was no significant reaction at all. it's a market (multiple speakers). it's very hard -- i mean you're not going to be taking deposits at a loss that are just very temporary to help our clients, so i think everyone understands that.
10;1;87;4;0.04597701149425287;there was not anything particularly noteworthy in terms of one-time events. it was really quite broad particularly in derivatives. in cash the performance was i would say solid year over year because we saw strength in the americas this year but we had strength in europe last year. and i think the first-quarter 2014 was not particularly strong, so i think we were flatter a little bit with a relative comparison but it was a really strong absolute and we think probably strong relative performance.
10;2;59;1;0.01694915254237288;yes, this is where it would be. i would not say it's a driver, but we are as you said and the whole industry is looking to work with clients to optimize the use of the balance sheet and improve returns. so we've seen some of that. but i would not say it was a key driver.
10;3;242;0;0.0;it is more of the same. obviously g-sib took on a slightly heightened focus when we had some doubling happen in the proposal in december. so we've always been measuring and monitoring and tracking g-sib at a very granular level. but we are obviously on a path now to aggressively manage it which means that we are going to be just a little bit more focused on that constraint, not uniquely also with advanced capital, standardized limits, balance sheet caps, the like. so it's more of the same, honestly, than just a heightened focus on this given the us proposal and given the impact of at least at this point fx translations. and different than rwa it affects certain products more than others. and we pointed out nonoperating deposits, stuff like that. certain businesses more than others we've pointed out clearing and certain clients more than others we've pointed out financial institutions. so it's just kind of a multi-variant theme. it's not mystical and we're actually already starting to reprice some of these businesses to get an adequate return on g-sib capital. and we're seeing other people do that too. that's right. we may be in a different position with g-sib but others are leverage constrained. and just generally speaking we are starting to see a lot more discipline around balance sheet and pricing is following somewhat generally.
10;4;181;4;0.022099447513812154;so again assuming for a second that rates do not rise until the backend if not the end of the year and we can come back to that if you like we would expect our nii dollars to be stable to slightly up because we're still seeing growth in our interest-earning assets. obviously this quarter we were down some on day count, it was a big chunk of the quarter-on-quarter reduction. so we're really going to see the biggest lift in nii when we do see interest rates rise and we'll see when that is. and similarly on our nim we would expect nim to be stable particularly given as we talked about what we've seen dilute our nim more particularly over the course of the last year or two has been this significant increase in cash and we're going to see some of that at least stabilize and turn as we start to reduce nonoperating deposits. so we should see our nim relatively stable and again start to rise when rates rise.
10;5;257;6;0.023346303501945526;okay, so taking your first point, erika, obviously i do not know the next time we're going to in all likelihood get ccar instructions including the rules and the minimums is likely to be some time towards the end of this year for the next ccar cycle as we get prepared to deliver that. so all i can say is what you know which is clearly the door was left open for the minimum to be increased or potentially to include some element of the surcharge. we're hopeful that that will not be the case because we would say the surcharge should be carried in baseline times to be used in stress and to have all firms end up well-capitalized afterwards. but i have no more insight than that for you. with respect to the dialogue with the fed look, it's definitely much, much further progressed than it was two years and three years ago and every year it gets better in terms of the bilateral conversations and it's constructive. i do not think, however, you could today or will likely ever be able to characterize it as transparent and clear, maybe potentially by design in terms of understanding or being able to reconcile exactly what their models do and what their results are driven by. so i will not be able to clarify for you what changed in their results or what differs between ours and theirs but the dialogue itself is definitely more constructive and more bilateral and more continuous.
10;6;63;2;0.031746031746031744;look, i think that the best way to answer that is that we are still firmly with our guidance of adjusted expenses being $57 billion plus or minus by the end of the year or for the year, sorry. obviously we will always try and outperform that but i would not characterize one quarter as a change in that guidance at this point.
10;7;73;2;0.0273972602739726;so look the most important thing obviously in all of that is that we were delighted to be able to partner with the large company on their strategic transformation and that's the most important thing about that transaction for us. i'm not going to comment specifically on whether or what jpmorgan would be interested in in terms of asset purchases. we're much more focused on partnering strategically with the company.
10;8;9;0;0.0;no, we have not given any specific guidance, chris.
10;9;71;0;0.0;in the context of the ccar we just had? we expect our -- it's a little complicated this year and we sort of articulated it at investor day because we're going to move at some point whether it's the third of the fourth quarter to have standardized rwa be our binding constraint. so 11% plus or minus is our target on cet1 and that's all we've said.
10;10;50;0;0.0;there's a couple of different things. one was a little specific. we had a portfolio of loans that we held for sale and have subsequently exited from the balance sheet which drives some of it. but in addition just generally a competitive environment and lower demand particularly in asia.
10;11;45;4;0.08888888888888889;not specifically, no. i will tell you that while we are obviously delighted with the performance it was a relatively strong market and there were some larger transactions so we're happy with the gains. i can not specifically comment on where it came from.
10;12;166;0;0.0;yes, it's definitely more the latter. so basically if you think about our e&p portfolio in particular when we think about the redetermination somewhat semiannually of the borrowing base and looked at those companies on a client-specific name by name basis there was some contraction in the borrowing base and therefore some downgrades that drive our reserving methodology. it does not mean that we feel that those companies are necessarily in significant difficulty but that's the way the reserving methodology works. and as i said we do this on a client by client basis, we're comfortable with our exposures and clients are looking to manage their own defensive position. so it's not clear that they will necessarily be realized in losses SEMICOLON in fact, if the implied curve rather than flat to long oil prices is in fact how things play out it's possible that there will be very little in the way of credit loss we'd experience.
10;13;2;0;0.0;both. both.
10;14;141;1;0.0070921985815602835;yes, so first of all just on the contraction in spend driven by oil prices it's pretty typical in this part of the cycle that you would see lower energy prices in the first instance drive savings rates up and you see consumer spend for the energy dividend so to speak lag back. so the fact that we saw that happen in the first quarter is not atypical and it does not mean that we do not expect the spend to grow and for that energy dividend to ultimately translate into higher spend going forward. so it's more of a normal timing phenomenon is our expectation but with respect to other activity, yes we saw active equity capital markets with some defensive issuance and generally i think it's a positive overall for the businesses and for the economy.
10;15;9;0;0.0;not readily but we can get back to you.
10;16;24;0;0.0;yes, nothing specific to call out in the second half of the year. and we should hit 11% if not a little better, yes.
10;17;156;0;0.0;look, i would say seven weeks or six weeks or whatever it is after investor day that the messaging has not really changed which is we have every intention of aggressively managing the score, doing it as we talked about earlier in a very granular way. and we're already working on that and you see that in the most obvious place which is in the reduction already to date in nonoperating deposits. but we continue to work on all of the things so derivative notional compression, level iii assets, financing, obviously we're still thinking about what the response should be in terms of risk intermediation and clearing. and so i think six weeks on from investor day the story is the same, we feel we are fully committed to ensuring that we are safely within the 4.5% bucket and we may not stop there but we're only a few months into this.
10;18;90;0;0.0;yes, i was obviously you noted it from a small base so that's notable. there are two specific transactions or two specific exposures that were moved to nonaccrual. one of them was moved on a somewhat of a technicality, a sovereign downgrade which we fully expect to recover on. but that is just the way we have to present it and the other smaller piece was one other isolated exposure. so i would not overthink it right now. it's two exposures and it's $200 million in total.
10;19;43;0;0.0;the first the sovereign downgrade was did have oil and gas underlying exposure but again it was on a technicality rather than on the fundamentals of the company. and we fully expect to recover on that. focus on the very, very small number.
10;20;120;4;0.03333333333333333;no, i would just say that overall our sense is that the market is neutral relative to the event. we happen to be able to benefit a little from it. some others will be more neutral and some may have lost. as these happen regular way in trading businesses and it just happens to be the case that that event and the volatility it drove is good for our client franchise. and i think it really just goes to show you that we're in a business where expertise matters and risk discipline matters and we were able to capitalize on both of those not just for the swiss franc but also for the other macro events in the quarter.
10;21;29;1;0.034482758620689655;no, i would not even characterize them as one-time gains. i would characterize them as one of a number of items that drove our performance in the business.
10;22;59;0;0.0;yes, so overall the total firm the reserve build that we took was a little over $100 billion, 4/5 of which was in the commercial bank. so we did experience -- we do all of this on a name-by-name basis, so we did it across our portfolios but the majority was in the cb e&p portfolio.
10;23;157;3;0.01910828025477707;it was $100 billion. $100 billion. no worries. $100 billion, i mean look at the end of the day you can see that over the course of the last since whatever the third quarter of 2012 our cash balances grew by a couple hundred billion dollars and that has been a very large contributor to the compression in our nim, not the only one. so as we push out the nonoperating deposits we would expect to see that help but remember we're still growing retail deposits. so if you look at this quarter in particular even though we reduced our nonop deposits related to client actions by about $20 billion, the majority of that $24 billion, we have flat deposits so we're continuing to grow the good retail deposits. so i would say it would be a tailwind but it would be a tailwind to a stabilizing and slightly improving nim outside of rate rises.
10;24;70;0;0.0;no, i'm sorry of the top of my head can not remember the number you're saying. but no, our legal expenses, forget the legal expense that relates to reserves that we've taken and settlements that we reached, our regular way expense for third parties in legal is not down substantially quarter on quarter or year on year at this point, although at some point it will be.
10;25;129;1;0.007751937984496124;so specifically with respect to the quarter i would say that the wholesale parameter update -- wholesale credit parameter updates model benefits is about half of the rwa reduction with the other half coming from regular way portfolio run off as well as some reductions in market risk associated with market risk positions, reductions in private equity, reductions in commitment. so some position reductions rather than driven specifically by fx. look, we're running above $1.5 trillion now and we said we're going to manage both the advance and standardize to that number over the course of the next couple of years. so if fx or if the currency translation is a tailwind then we would hope to do better but at this point let's get there.
10;26;158;0;0.0;so at the moment our cet1 ratio launching into ccar was below 10%, not the 12% that we expect to run at once we have built our capital to our target level. and so you are right that right now under ccar tier 1 leverage was our binding constraint both last year and this year. and so a combination of our capital strategy around how we think about the issuance of preferred together with balance sheet actions will be how we think about mitigating that limitation in the short to medium term. but ultimately it does not change the fact that once we get to our target assuming that is the 12% that we articulated at investor day that again we do not think we should be leverage constrained, so yes we're going to work on that obviously and we are continuing to build capital but when we launched into ccar we were not at that level.
10;27;105;2;0.01904761904761905;to give you a little perspective i also spoke in that the banking system is much stronger to start with and every bank in the system is much stronger. so just trying to think through what are the effects of some of these things and we look at it is kind of a warning shot across the bow. what i worry about more is what happens in a stress environment and i think people are paying attention to what's going on in the markets and if there has to be changes down the road there might be some changes that are relevant to that.
10;28;142;3;0.02112676056338028;i think the best way to think about it is through the cycle target that doug petno put out at investor day which is 18%. so that does not mean to say that we will benefit when rates rise in this business and it is very competitive and spreads are compressing and there's a lot of factors going on but through the cycle 18% so we're some years below and some above. just the question on core growth and security services outside of presentation changes and client exits is currently in the low single digits. so obviously a little bit muted because we're working on the balance sheet optimization but certainly growing and in the low single digits and in terms of looking at advisory and who we are gaining share from principally european banks. okay, no more questions?
11;1;262;2;0.007633587786259542;so to -- obviously we do not have any particular insight. i think the comments you're referring to were comments about the support for evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all [of it]. and so really it has not changed relative to previous comments and the door has clearly been left open for that, but we have no further information. and so far it's evaluating the possible inclusion of some or all of the surcharge, so we're just going to have to i suppose and see. meanwhile, as you know, we are -- and by the way, if it happens for us it would happen for everyone. we have shown you before -- not that that's a good outcome, but we've shown you before that we think that regardless the competitive peers set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels. and so if everybody has to increase their minimum, it is going to be a similar position for everyone. meanwhile, we are continuing to execute on everything that we've already told you we are going to do to optimize our capital. our commitment is to go to firmly within the 4.5% bucket for the surcharge, and if we believe we can do it and it's economic and it's not going to hurt our clients, we may go further. so we will respond when we see the rules and we are not going to stop continuing to do the best we can to optimize our returns based on scarce resources.
11;2;116;2;0.017241379310344827;we actually have not really changed our point of view since the investor day and previously about the fact that we are expecting retail deposit -- and there are other people who have slightly differing views. but we are expecting retail deposits to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles, given the competition for good, high-quality, lcr-compliant retail deposits SEMICOLON given the advancements in mobile banking SEMICOLON given the awareness in the general environment around low rates and the desire to participate in rising rates. so when we think about our sensitivity and our reprice, we model it in assumption that it's going to be higher, somewhat higher.
11;3;431;2;0.004640371229698376;obviously, when you talk about trading, when you have two months to go in a quarter you do not know the exact number and repricing is a complex issue. i'll give you some very specific things and then i'll tell you why it's hard to figure out exactly what shows up. clearing, we've definitely seen people start to charge for clearing and effectively charge the balance sheet 25, 50 basis points. it's a small business so i do not think it's going to dramatically affect those lines. prime broker, we've seen similar type of thing. repo, it seems that people are charging pretty much for repo. we need to get a return on it. exotic derivatives, which are again very small, are being repriced to, i would say, full capital and liquidity. muni credit has probably been repriced a little bit. again, it's a small market. if you go to credit and trading, so credit we've really not seen any repricing effectively in commercial credit. you've seen a little bit in mortgage to make up for the extra costs in mortgage. you've seen a little bit in auto SEMICOLON it got more aggressive, not less aggressive. so trade finance you've seen a little bit of repricing, and i know these are not all trading numbers. what you do not see, mike, is that in a lot of cases, while you may have repriced a little bit, you're also shedding business so that you have -- as you are protecting your margins by -- because of aml costs you are going to not do certain types of business anymore. in fha the lifetime cost of servicing, you cut back on fha volumes, etc. so you're protecting your margins, but you're actually shrinking your revenues in some cases. that's happening a little bit in clearing and prime broker and stuff like that SEMICOLON you want your best clients. in other categories clients are -- like deposits, we have not seen repricing effectively, i do not think, in non-operating deposits. on the other hand, some clients are saying let's restructure our relationship SEMICOLON it makes more sense for you, jpmorgan. i'm willing to give you other business which is not credit sensitive, etc. it's kind of a whole of the amount of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return on your capital, not necessarily to show revenue growth in that line item. it's very easy to show revenue growth.
11;4;47;1;0.02127659574468085;mostly what you see in trading is just volume related and spread related, etc. even in trading, spreads are narrow but breadth is also very low, which means spreads get gap out pretty quickly, which eventually could be good for trading. so it's unclear (multiple speakers).
11;5;38;0;0.0;i'm talking about basis points, 20 basis points, 15 basis points, 10 basis points. that's all you need in some of these things to get an adequate return on capital as we currently look at capital.
11;6;348;7;0.020114942528735632;so what i said, and hopefully it was clear, is that we actually exceeded our commitment. we actually shrunk our non-operating deposits by more than $100 billion and not just through our consumer deposits, but we are also able to grow wholesale operating deposits. so we had a good mix shift both in consumer versus wholesale, but also within wholesale and so we feel really great about that. there are two priorities after that. the first is protecting that position and making sure that we are able to not have inflows of those deposits as the industry continues to absorb them. but the second is we will likely look to potentially push a little farther, but it gets harder and harder each margin, the next $5 billion or $10 billion, as you get more and more closely aligned to operating accounts and operating business. and we've always said that we want to do this for the right reasons, for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that's going to materially harm our clients. so that's the lens. the [product] has also been made in the level iii assets: derivative receivables, certain balance sheet items, rwa. so the effort to optimize the balance sheet for g-sifi, etc., is not going to stop SEMICOLON that we are going to continue to do. but you know what, i do not anticipate us launching another and announcing another program. we've already done a little better. we will continue to try and do a little better. in terms of revenue impact, not very much right now, as you might very well know, because you can see that the balance is much more on a spot basis that on an average basis. but the equation looking forward will be much the same math we said at investor day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for a half a year, but there would be some expense benefits on fdic costs, etc. so not a very big number. i think that was the question?
11;7;4;0;0.0;a little bit, yes.
11;8;294;1;0.003401360544217687;yes, so let me do this in two parts, and i'm going to start with the consumer businesses, where the commitment is actually a couple of years old and we are sort of well, well on our way to delivering against that -- the commitment $2 billion dollars in 2017 versus 2014. it's not exactly linear, but you can consider it to flow through time. and if you look at the ccb page on whatever page that is, i think we show that for the first half of the year our expenses are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion. so that gives you a sense for how we are tracking. on the cib, obviously the commitment is somewhat newer SEMICOLON at investor day this year $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014. i would characterize that in two parts. $1.5 billion is business simplification. the majority of business simplification -- not all, but the majority -- will come out of our run rate in 2015. and you've already seen that in the first and second quarter when you've seen the $300 million, $400 million expense reductions in each of the quarters on business simplification. the other $1.3 billion, which is all the reductions in technology and operations and headcount, is going to be things. we are working on it actively -- we have programs, we have people -- but it's going to be more of a 2016 and 2017 benefit. if i was to look at the first half of 2015 versus the first half of 2014, take the $500 billion in consumer and business simplification in the cib space -- that's probably the right way to size it, about a quarter so far this year.
11;9;1;0;0.0;yes.
11;10;133;4;0.03007518796992481;rwa, advance rwa is down $36 billion, $37 billion SEMICOLON [one five three six]. we said a little greater than $1.5 trillion. we are still on track to be $1.5 trillion or a little greater, $1.5 trillion advanced at the end of the year. standardized right now is at $1.5 trillion, $1.5 trillion, so pretty close to $1.5 trillion against the target at the end of the year of $1.55 trillion. that's a little better, but obviously on the standardized you have some upward pressure as we continue to grow those really great loans that we are growing. if you look to our investor day targets, we are still hoping to maintain the discipline around both of those at approximately $1.5 trillion through time.
11;11;144;2;0.013888888888888888;of course. i'll do it in three parts. first of all, it is growing pretty solidly or strongly, so either in-line or in many cases better than the industry across most of the product categories. the one that's growing the most strongly because of the way we are portfolioing loans is mortgage, so that's driving some of that outperformance. and the one that is most challenging, but still growing, is middle market. fiercely competitive SEMICOLON everybody is chasing that sector. but you can go through the businesses. we had 6% loan growth, 8% loan and lease growth in auto SEMICOLON 6% business banking SEMICOLON 19% core in consumer SEMICOLON 4% in commercial, so 3% core in card. so it's solid to strong pretty much across the board SEMICOLON most competitive in middle-market and flattered by portfolio and mortgages.
11;12;162;1;0.006172839506172839;what i said earlier is not inconsistent SEMICOLON it's entirely consistent with what we said last quarter. we built reserves modestly for oil and gas last quarter on the back of the spring redetermination of borrowing base. we feel another modest reserve this quarter. and we said we do not -- we might expect more reserves in the second half of the year. there's another redetermination cycle in the fall and it's i'm not going to say likely, but it's possible we will be selectively downgrading some clients. if none of that is out of our expectations, it's completely normal levels considering the cycle and how we think about the credits, we are still very happy. and we are not going to make any comments on regulators. those reserves do not mean we're going to have losses. correct. we are reserving for downgrades SEMICOLON does not necessarily mean that they are going to be cash losses.
11;13;120;1;0.008333333333333333;so credit, like charge-offs, have been very benign across the whole sales base. they have reverted to somewhat more normal levels in auto, so i'm not expecting there to be a big step changes in the underlying charge-offs in the wholesale space. we continue to see improvements at a slower pace in mortgage, but at 21 basis points we are sort of getting down there. and card, while it is slightly above -- 2.6% above our 2.5% is also pretty much getting there. it's one of the reasons why we've said expect the second half to look like the first half in terms of order of magnitude and expect net-net low for long.
11;14;161;1;0.006211180124223602;i would say in the non-credit -- sorry, just to clarify the comment on oil and gas SEMICOLON we said they will not necessarily translate into losses. we are not going to predict which ones will or will not. on the reserves, for non-credit-impaired portfolio we are continuing to see improvements in charge-offs as well as home prices, albeit a little bit more gradually. so i would still expect there to be more reserve releases over the course of the next 18 months in hundreds of millions of dollars in total SEMICOLON not billions any longer, of course. we have $1.8 billion reserved right now. in the post-credit-impaired space clearly that's life-of-loan model and so we will continue to evaluate that model against parameters that we have in it and expectations, so that will be what it is at the time. and in card we're not expecting any significant reserve actions.
11;15;127;4;0.031496062992125984;so you are absolutely right SEMICOLON all the underlying phenomenon are still there. we are still seeing spread compression, but we are seeing very strong growth in spend. we are not quite lapped yet on new accounts going through the revenue rate. we will eventually be, but it's a good thing to be adding these new accounts that will drive strong spend in the future. so i would say our near-term guidance is that we are expecting our revenue rate to be at the lower end of that 12%, 12.5% range. and, yes, over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships we would expect that to start to edge up.
11;16;113;4;0.035398230088495575;yes. we told you we would hope to drive core loan growth in the card space low single digits and this quarter it was 3%. i just want to emphasize -- marianne mentioned it, but emphasize SEMICOLON chase paymentech, which is seeing really good growth, probably 50% faster than the industry, but we are also signing people with chase paymentech combined with chasenet. we are running real volume across it and we are signing up a lot of folks for that and chasepay. so the strategy of ours is kind of coming to fruition and we hope it will be a good driver SEMICOLON happy customers and good growth for the next 10 years.
11;17;85;1;0.011764705882352941;obviously we do not give you lots of details on our issuance plans. you are right SEMICOLON one of the drivers for us to issue in part, not exclusively, was it's not -- as you know, we were tier 1 leverage constrained in ccar and so as a result of issuing this we not only helped tlap, but we help our ccar stress capacity. and we are about 164 rwa. so we are not going to talk about forward issuance but we've made progress.
11;18;409;5;0.012224938875305624;so to start with volcker, we are not expecting volcker to have an impact in the near-term trading outlook. we've been talking very consistently over an extended period of time about the fact that we've reshaped our business through time to be compliant in substance and in form with volcker. and so while that was real reshaping of the business, the last 18 months have been really focused on getting operationally ready around the reporting and the metrics SEMICOLON it's been hard work and we are ready. so i do not expect it to have a direct impact on our near-term trading. clearly over time we need to continue to evolve the feedback loop with regulators, but that will be entirely gradual. with respect to the trading, it is too early for us to say anything specific about the second quarter -- sorry, the third quarter -- except to say we are -- all other things equal, we would expect to see normal seasonality from the market. nothing has changed that fundamentally would not have us expecting normal seasonality in the third quarter. i just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time, has been -- we've become very consistent. i think in 2014 we had no trading loss days and even this year there were only a handful of trading loss days. obviously some areas are up and some are down, but our shares are high. i think we are doing a great job servicing clients. we are adopting all the new rules. like [50%] of interest-rate swaps are on sef today and i think it's 95% of fx trading by transaction is electronic. you can do a lot on your mobile phone or ipad now, so the business is actually doing fine. the returns on risk are very good. we used to report that, but kind of return on var are very good. it's become a much more stable business that clients need overtime. right. and just to add to that, i would say that we also talked about, in the period of transition towards a more normal economy and rising rates, you might see some shocks like this. we've weathered both the emea bond sell off and china well, and it just speaks to the strength of our risk management discipline. and we generally do pretty well in more difficult markets.
11;19;91;2;0.02197802197802198;so with respect to -- we saw a stronger seasonal purchase market. we actually gained a little share in the purchase market in the quarter and refi held up pretty well because of pipelines coming into the quarter. but we are expecting that to grow seasonally in purchase and in refi to pull that down to smaller levels in the third seasonally. and no direct impact from the disclosure requirements. part of the quarter is the reserve takedown, so do not double count that. that may not be there next quarter. right.
11;20;82;1;0.012195121951219513;the way i would think about it is normal tax rate for the year is 30%, plus or minus. just given the way tax reserving is it's usually biased to being fairly conservative and so, as you know, we have seen discrete tax gains periodically, some of them not insignificant, resulting from completion of settlements and audits with tax authorities. not to say that you should necessarily model in directly 30%, but we do not predict or forecast the tax benefits.
11;21;20;0;0.0;it's definitely the latter and i think it's perhaps a little too early to tell on the former.
11;22;14;0;0.0;jumbo. yes. so over half are jumbo, the other are conventional performing fee plus.
11;23;110;1;0.00909090909090909;we have a fairly large securities portfolio and our decisions around that are in part driven by our overall interest-rate risk positioning, but with respect to the mortgages it's fundamentally a better execution decision for us. we will portfolio or loan where it makes economic sense to do it relative to distributing it, other than jumbo where, clearly, they will always go on our balance sheet. if you can put a jumbo on a higher roe than a fannie/freddie, you would do that. and part of the investment portfolio is for liquidity and obviously, because non-operating deposits are down, proportions of that will come down too.
11;24;496;3;0.006048387096774193;there's been a lot of press and reports, including recently, on market liquidity and there are a number of factors playing into it. it's true that liquidity, in some cases, has dried up quite quickly when there's been extreme volatility and it fed on itself. but the reality is that we've talked about the fact that that was likely to be a phenomenon that happened more frequently as we transition to a more normal environment. we are very disciplined about how we trade and support our clients and generally we've been able to weather them very well, as has generally the community. not that we know, but we have not got any stories or horror stories around (inaudible) a bond sell-off or other things this quarter. so i think it's definitely an issue SEMICOLON one that we need to watch, one that has multiple root causes, and one that we are generally taking in our stride. and look at the big picture and we pointed it out, the financial system -- like in the united states banks are much more sound. trading books have more capital liquidity. the whole system is better off. so you can not look at one piece and say what will that do. the second is that these -- obviously there's less liquidity in the marketplace and it's a whole bunch of factors. it's hard to tease out exactly which one, but trading books have more capital and more liquidity. i think people are a little worried about potential volcker rule violations, so they are being a little more cautious. there are obviously structural changes in electronic trading, hft, and each business is slightly different. so not every -- i would not say everyone is affected exactly the same. it's also true that the system is pretty resilient to what happened with the currencies and treasury, and that's a good sign. i think what we are going to be really cautious about is when markets are not that good. jpmorgan is fine. we are not talking about whether or not jpmorgan is going to have a hard time with liquidity. we are not. the question i really would have is, when markets are tough, will there be a feedback from -- these violent markets, will there be more volume or less volume. someone was quoted the other day saying markets always pull back when there are tough times SEMICOLON that is true. the question is will be harder and worse, will it feed back into the real economy. it's not will there be lack of liquidity. during the crisis they were two market makers out there and we were one of them and so you need them a little bit, but it does not stop markets from gapping out. we are not saying this is a terrible thing, just being very cautious about it. and we are always trying to be very cautious.
11;25;262;4;0.015267175572519083;so i can tell you that obviously we took the feedback from the regulators as the industry did exactly as you would expect, entirely seriously SEMICOLON put loads of resources and effort to bear in making as much progress as we thought was humanly possible over the course of the period. and we feel that we made very, very -- i would agree with you SEMICOLON the industry, but jpmorgan specifically, made very, very significant progress in addressing the feedback between getting it and the july submission date. and obviously we feel like we have a credible plan. that's not to say that we will not continue and some of our plans, and you saw it in some other disclosures. we are going to continue to work very hard at simplifying our legal entity structure over the next few years and interconnectedness and operational resiliency and all the things -- and reporting readiness, all the things that are going to make it even better. so we think we made very, very significant progress. we think our plan is credible. we do not know exactly when we will get feedback, probably in the fall. and we respond to every single thing regulators raise with the huge resources to meet their needs. it will probably be iterative over time about they'll make more demands this year, etc. and --. by the way, i think there is a 50-page public part that you can actually read and it shows you. that's a 50-page summary of i think a 200,000 page detailed report.
11;26;149;1;0.006711409395973154;it's very broadly competitive and we compete obviously with big banks, regional banks, and non-banks. it's not that we are losing loans and deals most often on price. it's normally on size of holds or non-bank taking whole deals or on structures, but it's very, very competitive. everybody likes the sector for growth and everybody likes -- so everybody is trying to make progress. we are being very, very disciplined, and as a result of that, slightly lower growth than the industry average. and you might not always want us to always grow at the industry average. you want us to hold true to discipline. remember, we looked at the whole relationship. i forgot the exact number, but if you look at the middle market relationship, i think something like half, maybe even a little bit less, of the revenues are from the lending.
11;27;295;2;0.006779661016949152;the way i would characterize it is we had a period of time following the wampum merger where we were in new markets and we did not have the right distribution footprint where we were building. we said about a year and a half ago that we felt like we had the right footprint as a macro matter, about 5,600, and that now we are around perfecting that, which is about consolidating certain branches where it makes sense but building new ones where makes sense. consolidating them together where it makes sense. you will see i think gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years and that's probably still the right way to look at it, but it's really perfecting the network. moving branches to the areas we like where there's a high density of affluence. and then, as you know, really looking at the nature of branches: so the footprint, the way we are using them, the way we are staffing them, importantly, moving them to more advice and less transaction, more automation. definitely responsive to the evolution in customer preferences. and mobile and online is not only a fantastic customer experience evidenced in our experience stat, but it's also a lower cost to serve, so we are also improving the profitability of the very highly transactional customers. i think gordon used the word omnichannel. we have a place for everything in our suite and branches are very important. we're just going to be evolving them to continue to meet customer needs. one add is that we are thinking about attacking a new city for the first time, like in a major way, because we want to see how that works out.
11;28;99;1;0.010101010101010102;in the non-operating deposits within the wholesale deposits, the majority is the cib, but not quite two-thirds. and then you've got the commercial bank and you've got a little bit in asset management. so it is the majority of the number, but there are still sizable numbers, particularly in the commercial bank in the financial (inaudible) space. and then, when you look at our overall balance sheet, you see cash going down because of the deposits. you see securities going down, but strong loan growth offsetting, and then small reductions in trading and secured financing.
11;29;25;0;0.0;are you doing year-over-year? you're starting in the wrong time period. are you starting at the year-end or year over year?
11;30;53;1;0.018867924528301886;well, we are getting more operating deposits, too. we talked about the deposit reduction is overachieving in non-op and improving mix in operating. so, trust me -- and i'm not looking at what you're looking at, so i do trust you -- but trust me that 60%-ish of it is cib.
11;31;9;0;0.0;we will clarify off this line because (multiple speakers).
11;32;192;2;0.010416666666666666;the m&a -- we do not think greece has affected the m&a dialogue very much, because it's been very active pretty much around the world. and when i say around the world, it's also like european companies coming to america and american companies going to europe, etc., and those conversations continue. a lot to europe, yes. a lot to europe, yes. so greece had no real effect on that. greece is a very, very small percent of the eurozone in total, so economically it's not a driving factor for most of the companies there. psychologically maybe it's going to affect some people, but i do not see why a company that has its own ambitions is going to change them because of greece. and would just -- with respect to the backlog, i would say it's very good. we did see a tremendous amount of something that we've almost never seen before, of american companies financing in euro because it was cheaper to do that, even if you swap back to dollars. so you saw a lot of american companies going to europe to do that.
11;33;258;2;0.007751937984496124;i think if you go back to last quarter, brennan, and take a look at the remarks from last quarter, we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the adr business that drove a reduction, but just a classification issue. and then in addition we did lose a large client at the end of last year and that is having an impact. i think if you go back and look at the second quarter, hopefully that will make it clear. and so the guidance, when we did those -- when we made that presentational change and obviously we talked about the client exit a few quarters ago, the guidance was, given those, we would expect the revenues to run between $950 million seasonally. and this is obviously a strong season and, therefore, it at through $950 million and $1 billion seasonally and, therefore, it's at the $1 billion. so marianne gave you all very specific guidelines, which we do not normally do, on treasury services, investor services, and expenses in the commercial bank because a lot of you have your models wrong. and sarah finds it very frustrating that you can not get it corrected quarter after quarter, so we've said here is the number that is actually our best guess. so, please, put it in your third- and fourth-quarter models. and mortgage revenue was another one which has been ongoing to us. and what's the other one so we can just get it on the table whatever it is?
11;34;373;1;0.002680965147453083;nancy, it's really important -- when we talk about these numbers, by the way, rwa and branches, we are not making commitments to anybody. that's our best guess knowing what we know today, but we reserve the right to change that on a moment's notice for whatever reason that makes sense for the company and the clients. and so branches -- it is very important that you look at branches city by city until you have the right footprint. so if you remember, the old a&p which never changed its locations and it never changed sizes and it failed. any retail business should always be adding in new communities, subtracting in some SEMICOLON having the branches to adjust to a new reality, whether it's getting bigger or getting smaller. in our case it's getting smaller, but again we are not getting smaller because we are guessing at this stuff. we are getting smaller because of the less need for operations and branches now. people are doing far more on mobile phones like that. so we actually do it city by city. you do not set an overall guideline and say you have to do x, y, or z. it's city by city. and so, for the most part, in the wamu footprint, i think florida and california for the most part, city by city we went in and added what we thought we should have. wampum -- remember we also added on top of that small business, private banking, some middle-market, other businesses that wamu was not even in. it was part of the expansion of those businesses, too. and so when i said a new city, i'm talking about what we've never really done -- i was talking about this way back to bankone and the stocks when we did the merger with jpmorgan -- is going into a city de novo that we never been in. there you've got to look at how many branches you are going to open, how long is it going to take. and so we do want to do one of those and that will have nothing to do with wamu because they are also places that wamu was not.
11;35;485;1;0.002061855670103093;no. i do not think there's been a retreat from open markets there either. remember, we've always said about china is you got to look and plan for the long run, which we do in all businesses. mckinsey has a report that shows that they are going to have 25% or so of some of the fortune 1000 in i think it was 10 or 12 years. enormous growth in their companies. their companies are going overseas. their companies are doing more m&a. we did that one unique transaction where chemchina bought pirelli in italy. obviously, when we have a unique network, we can help a chinese company and an italian company at the same time, so we are building there for the long run. as a risk management tool we've always said that the way we treat that is we will be prepared for very tough times and i think it's a mistake not to grow because you're going to have tough times. i have never seen an economy that did not have tough times. if you went back to the united states, when j.p. morgan was building jpmorgan back in 1850 and 1860, look every single time that you panic because america had a recession there would be no jpmorgan. so we are not going to change. what we've seen with the officials in china is that they are very responsive to changes, and you can argue whether they should have gotten that involved in the stock market. you can not manipulate stock markets. but they are very responsive to lending. they've changed their reserve policies, their rmb policies, the qfii policies, the hong kong shanghai connect. not everything they do is going to work, but they still seem very committed to more and more market reform, more and more of taking soe -- rationalization of soes and taking them public, so some market discipline there. creating more of a consumer society. and what we've always said -- and i think they have the wherewithal to meet their short-term objectives of growth, but we expect that they will have bumps in the road. we expect that and we are going to look right through that. the fact that their -- i also remember their market went from $4 trillion value -- so it's a $10 trillion economy. it went from $4 trillion market value to $10 trillion SEMICOLON now it's back to $6 trillion. i think those are the numbers. the american stock market has done that roundtrip a couple times itself and so the american economy is $18 trillion. i think our stock market is $25 trillion, so there will still be huge opportunities there. if they ever completely reverse what they are talking about doing, you will see it in far more significant ways than them getting involved in the stock market.
11;36;132;1;0.007575757575757576;marianne, you showed a nim thing that nim would go back to 265 to 275. and, remember, when we say deposit beta it is by product, by --and it's got gamma, so the first 25 basis points, the second are a different 25 basis points, they are different than the third 25 basis points. it's a pretty intensive analysis to try to get accurate SEMICOLON that's what we're trying to do. and it's all in that number that was presented and we do not think that's changed dramatically. as marianne said, we are assuming that whatever happened in the last cycle, this one will be worse. in other words, you will gather less of the benefit from rates going up than we have in the past.
11;37;90;0;0.0;listen, there's a unique --. yes, (multiple speakers). it is a unique circumstance when you're at zero. there are a lot of things that happen when rates grow to 25 basis points that there will be -- you will pass very little of that also. and we also see that -- we will see that in money market funds. we will see that in some forms of deposits, etc. the beta gets much higher as rates go up. if i had to guess, i would say we are conservative, not aggressive.
11;38;60;0;0.0;yes, the credit downgrades included oil and gas and we called it out just because in total oil and gas was $140 million of our total net $250 million reserve build. but also i said that there were select names, it's like a dozen names, so it's not really like there's another sector, just very discrete names.
11;39;83;0;0.0;no, we are not going to give you that. we disclose -- when you say mortgage duration, obviously we build into all of our models mortgage duration. you guys can calculate that yourself by looking at disclosures in the 10-k that show mortgages at 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, etc. and obviously we can change that at will with our investment portfolio and things like that. it's all in the nim already. so obviously we have negative convexity in our portfolio.
12;1;1;0;0.0;yes.
12;2;231;5;0.021645021645021644;there are a couple of different questions in there and maybe i'll try and separate them. my comments about the seasonality in the fourth quarter were most particularly towards markets revenues and less so towards the ib revenue space. with ib revenues, it's a mixed story. talking now about the sort of banking revenues rather than markets revenues. so the pipeline for m&a remains very constructive and really pretty good, so we're expecting to continue to have strength in m&a in the fourth quarter. with ecm you saw obviously a pretty sharp falloff in activity in the third quarter. we have seen the pipeline in ecm to the degree that that shows you visibility into the fourth quarter which is somewhat limited. we have seen that build up and so there is possibility that we'll be able to pull through some of that into the fourth quarter. but that will depend upon how the markets behave. with respect to dcm, our sort of guidance there was a commentary really mainly to the strength of the fourth quarter last year and on relative basis, the pipeline is down. and it's really to do with normal refinances are slowing and the maturity wall is smaller but it's still healthy. it's just not going to be at the same levels that we saw last year.
12;3;135;2;0.014814814814814815;look, the situation for us in markets was one where there was volatility, regardless of you how you want to characterize it, and people were acting -- our clients were acting on the back of that. we were able to capitalize on that flow. we were able to intermediate for our clients, put our capital [at risk and make] some money. we did pretty well where there was volatility. where there was not, it was more about, to your point, more about low levels of activity, people on the sidelines. it was tougher to make money because less was happening rather than anything else more significant than that. so far in the fourth quarter we're two weeks in, it's too early to say, but there's not been a tremendous change in the landscape.
12;4;197;3;0.015228426395939087;looking at the revenue rate, the guidance, remember our guidance previously had been you should expect our revenue rate to be at the low end of the 12% to 12.5% range. the most important thing we want you to take away from talking about our co-brand partners is that we feel great about having signed up united airlines and southwest airlines and partnering with them again for the medium term. and the economics of those deals on a standalone basis are still really very good. but the co-brand space is very competitive and when any of those contracts are going to be renegotiated at this point, they're going to be renegotiated to competitive levels. and so, it's really the fact that we're seeing that is going to come through in our revenue rate in the fourth quarter which is going to push it down to below 12%. it does not change the fact that the roe target for the business is still 20% and that the economics of those partnerships are still good. remember, these -- just given the numbers, it's $200 million a quarter for four quarters until it lapse.
12;5;285;5;0.017543859649122806;so i would say, first of all, we gave some expense goals in investor day for both consumer businesses as well as for the cib. and those were i think pretty sizable goals, $2 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the consumer businesses and $2.8 billion in 2017 versus 2014 for the cib. and we are working through that. we are on track in both of them. i think i said earlier that adjusted, the consumer businesses in the three quarters so far are $700 million down year-over-year in expenses. so against the $2 billion target, we're certainly getting there. and on the cib, we expected 2015 to be mainly about forcing out those business simplification expenses and we've essentially done that too. so we're on track. we're pushing hard. we still have work to do. we are always going to be diligent on our expenses and generally speaking at investor day we also said we're going to be on or down which is actually pushing hard to keep them down but not at the expense of good investments in the business. so obviously we are going to respond appropriately to the revenue pressure but not overreact. i've spoken my whole life about good expenses and bad expenses. bad expenses are waste, things you do not need. you do not have [to trade through] processing, things like that. we want certain expenses to go up. when we find marketing opportunities in card, we're going to spend it. if the investment bank does better, the comp accrual is going to go up. that's how we run the company. that's not ever going to change.
12;6;88;0;0.0;so mike, thanks for that. so $700 million, if you adjust for legal expense in the consumer businesses year-to-date, we'll do some more in the fourth quarter. and year-to-date on business simplification, which i think for in total was about $1.5 billion, we've done $1.3 billion. in total, that's $2 billion so far. obviously more work to do in 2016. with respect to the adjusted overhead ratio, it speaks a bit more to seasonality of revenues than anything else.
12;7;178;4;0.02247191011235955;i'll start. jamie, you can yes or no at the end. mike, we would say that the us economy is doing pretty well there. we're seeing good demand for loans in the consumer space and reasonably good sentiment in the business banking space and our core loan growth numbers do show that. there's nothing particularly funky in the loan growth numbers. we do our very best to show them in the right light. i would take a slightly different perspective on the jobs report on the non-farm payrolls. and not to sort of over think it, but while i know it was somewhat lower than people were expecting or possibly hoping for, it's still at around 140,000, almost two times what would be required to have stable unemployment. so it's only one report too. you can not overreact to it. it's not that we're seeing anything that's causing us any concern and our outlook for the fourth quarter is pretty solid i think. jamie, anything? nothing to add.
12;8;336;6;0.017857142857142856;we did better than we had targeted on our non-op deposits. we worked very, very hard but we told you we would on derivative notionals, compressionals, so our level 3 assets. it is absolutely the case, not to diminish the amount of work we've done and the progress we've made, that we obviously went after the most impactful -- least impactful to the client franchise, most impactful to the ratio with a less revenue [give-up] first. we made great progress. it becomes increasingly, not exponentially, but increasingly more difficult for every net basis point. that's not to say, by the way, that we are not continuing to work very hard at it and optimize and that we will not push further. but we're not at a place right now where we're going to target anything structurally below this, except for over the longer term just continuing to work through it. and our overall capital target, we're at 11.4% now. our overall capital target still in the short to medium term is still 12%. i just want to add, in the new world we have to obviously monitor and push down to all the business levels, gsib, ccar, basel, lcr and slr, and we want to optimize all of them. so we're only living with this for a couple years now. as we embed it in our systems, we'll have a better way to track it and monitor it. over time, i would expect the gsib will come down a little bit. it only comes down in lumps. you got to make a big difference to go from 4% to 3.5% but imagine over time, i'm talking about years. i'm not talking about anything you'd see this quarter. we are very comfortable where we are today. over years, you might have to change some of your business strategies but i think it's a better thing not to be an outlier in gsib.
12;9;231;4;0.017316017316017316;it has nothing to do with next year, betsy. when i say over time, it just happens that jpmorgan built a global corporate investment bank. 70% of it is financial institutions, 30% corporate. we easily could have been built the other way around, we focused on it over time. when i say over time, it might be quite easy for us to say that over five to six years let's focus more on corporates and less on financials and that will affect your gsib fairly substantially. that's what i'm talking about. it has nothing to do with ccar for next year or anything like that. a couple of really small points on ccar for next year for what it's worth is we were constrained in ccar by leverage. we have issued $6 billion of preferreds in the year. we are reacting to try and make sure that we are managing our binding constraints or our most binding constraints. so we're working on that. the other thing to note is that we're at 11.4% as we sit here now. so we're not gliding a long way from where we need to get to. both of those things together, with obviously our profitability, should mean that we have incremental opportunity. but our range is 55% to 75% and we hope to be in that range.
12;10;155;1;0.0064516129032258064;so just a couple of things. first of all, i think the [fsb] thing was a sort of leak. so it's as good as it is. i will tell you that the news on structured notes was not strongly positive but we hadn't banked on it being. so not entirely pleasing but not disappointing relative to our models and expectations. other things to pay attention to anyway are there's no change to the internal tlac assumptions. the clean holding company rule is one that we're watching out for. but fundamentally -- and then there was the timing. is there going to be a substantially elongated transition period? i would call it all fairly marginal. it has not changed the overall picture for us. we're at around 16% and we'll figure out the fsb proposal that's leaked out was not shockingly different and we'll see how the fed responds.
12;11;234;4;0.017094017094017096;so with respect to the fourth quarter, we are expecting our loans to grow and overall net-net [rotation out], cash and securities to loans would be supportive of nii. but remember, the biggest boost to our nim was associated -- or was a big boost to our nim was associated with changing the mix, reducing our overall cash balances. so, a few things going on. the outlook for the fourth quarter being relatively flat was associated with market implied rates which are relatively flat. and so in the law of big numbers, that plus or minus a few basis points is what we're expecting. with respect to looking out to 2016, obviously we do not know what's going to happen with the rate curve. if rates stay very flat we should still have upward pressure on our nii associated with the change in mix of our balance sheet. so the fact that we've got a smaller interest earning asset base and more loans and less cash and less securities should be supportive even on flat rates. we do not know when rates will rise but if market [implies] are followed or if the fed [dots] or anything like realistic, then that will be even more constructive. remember in the first year, we get the biggest benefit from short end rates and the first 50 basis points of them. no, unfortunately not.
12;12;131;1;0.007633587786259542;so i would say that first of all, with respect to purchased credit impaired, with this release we did on the $375 million, that's our baseline expectation for that portfolio. our baseline expectation is no material incremental reserves. obviously if things improve and they're sustained, then there may be more reserve releases. but i would not try and model those. with respect to the noncredit impaired portfolio we talked about, you've seen our charge-offs at normalized 14 basis points. our portfolio quality is really getting quite high. we're cycling through most of the significant risks. reserve releases will be more modest and a little bit more periodic and several hundred million dollars next year, maybe $300 million plus or minus but not significantly more than that.
12;13;69;1;0.014492753623188406;look, our efficiency target at 55% was over three years or so and we still will be driving to get to around that level. but it does, as you quite rightly mention, include not just rates rising but a fair degree of normalization in rates. we'll see what happens in 2016. obviously it's possible but we're not going to call an outlook on rates next year.
12;14;135;0;0.0;okay. so we've taken some large reserves in the last few quarters and our overall reserve number obviously is consistent with our expectations based upon the outlook for oil prices. there was a redetermination cycle that we reserved for in the first quarter and so there will be another one in the fall. we've been as forward leaning on that as we can be. obviously i'm not saying that there may not be any net incremental reserve build but we're not expecting them to be significant. a lot of companies have tried to adjust their expense bases and otherwise help their position. so if energy prices stay around these levels and recover slowly, we're expecting, net, not to have material incremental reserves in the next quarter. we may see some.
12;15;319;5;0.01567398119122257;let me deal first of all with production quarter-over-quarter revenues. margins are down. margins are down for two principal reasons. remember, quarter-over-quarter, at least on a closed loan volume, we were at a consistent level. margins are down because we moved a mix shift towards correspondent from retail towards purchase from re-fi as well as capacity in the industry, more capacity in the industry and therefore less constraints. so the production quarter-over-quarter revenue is more of a margin number than anything. with respect to year-over-year, i do want to make this clear. with respect to the guidance year-over-year that we should expect non-interest revenue for the mortgage company in totality to be down $250 million. that brings our total year-over-year nir down around $1 billion, maybe a little more, which is what we guided to at investor day. and it's more off the back of lower repurchase reserve releases, lower gains on ginnie mae sales and [xi] gains, non fee-based revenues that are to do with our third party upb as well as run off in the upb. so it's consistent with our guidance. it was not fully reflected in everyone's models. i think there was a third part to your question but i have to say i've -- oh, expenses, yes. thank you. on expenses -- we continue to work very hard on our expense equation, both in terms of managing down the -- particularly in the servicing space by the way, managing down the default inventory in a number of different ways but also investing in our operating model. so in technology, to improve the production operations cycle process, also in our site strategy. so no, we are not done. we continue to work very hard at it. we have made great progress but we continue to work hard at it.
12;16;88;1;0.011363636363636364;obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific. we would be willing to take and we do take a look at things when they come up and if we are able to price for the risk and it's in a client segment or an entry we like we might be interested. but there's no -- we have no special comments on it. what we're really interested in is growing our underlying core loans with our customers that we can continue to do business with.
12;17;246;1;0.0040650406504065045;not as defaults happen. it's to do -- depends on whether it's reserve based lending or whether it's not. but as companies are either downgraded or as they are experiencing financial -- change in financial condition or the borrowing base is redetermined, we will act accordingly. we try to be as forward-leaning on that as is possible. we do not have perfect insight until some of that information becomes clear. that's the process. and the reserve base lending, you basically take essentially current prices, you discount at a discount rate, you assume expenses, you [active real engineer] your force and things like that, and you see if you can make rollover the loan at a sound -- i'm going to call it 65% ltv and we think it's pretty good. that's what we're here for is to lend to clients particularly in tough times. you can not be a bank that every time something goes wrong you run away from your client. we also do things like stress test down to $30 oil, maintain $30 for 18 months and say, how much more reserve do you have to put up? i think i said somewhere, you can correct this number, marianne, we're not in the same room, that if that happened, we think we're going to have to put up another $500 million or $750 million in reserves. which is just not something we worry a lot about.
12;18;0;0;NA; .
12;19;69;1;0.014492753623188406;so it's obviously a really great question. unfortunately we really do not guide to our forward-looking issuance. you're right, we are above 150 basis points right now and we're also working on our leverage balance sheet. so we're working the dials exactly what you would expect us to, but we're not going to make any comments about forward issuance. yep, i got it.
12;20;57;0;0.0;the pipeline for 2016 is building up, so we do not have perfect visibility yet. we think obviously the deals that were being done in 2015 were skewed toward larger deals and we think there may be more flow in 2016 but it looks pretty healthy to us so far, but it's building up. thank you.
12;21;111;0;0.0;i think over the last several quarters, forgive me if i'm slightly wrong but i do not think i'm entirely wrong, our sort of c&i growth has been broadly in line with the industry. remember that over the course of 2013 and 2014, we did a lot of work on simplifying our businesses and that had an impact on the pace of our loan growth. but our mature markets are performing well. we're seeing growth in our expansion markets. we're adding new clients. we're culling our prospects. so everything is set to continue to see growth more going forward than we have in the past.
12;22;47;0;0.0;there was about -- in cib, there was about $47 million of metals and mining, about net-net $20 million of bau growth and then just a few other normal bau puts and takes, downgrades, upgrades. other than those three things there was no one specific call out.
12;23;2;0;0.0;thanks, chris.
12;24;27;0;0.0;of the $19 billion that we put on our balance sheet, around $10 billion, just a little over $10 billion was jumbo. the rest was conventional conforming.
12;25;36;0;0.0;we'll have to get you the split. i think the jumbo's like a third arm. counting the conforming, i think it's all fixed. that's what i remember. we'll confirm for you.
12;26;185;1;0.005405405405405406;you are right that at these kind of 2.5%, 250 basis point levels in card, it does speak to the quality of the loans we're originating and the engagement with the customers. which is much more now about driving, yes, some nii but really, really good spend and therefore lower credit quality. it's an integrated equation. we're expecting, given our originations and the runoff portfolio, the work loans running off in the portfolio that we're building is really very, very clean. we're expecting that those charge-off rates to be low for the short to medium term, to read out for the next year for sure. and there will be a combination of things that would drive that. but largely it would be environmental. we do not expect at this point, we have made changes to our credit box but they are not material changes and we'll continue to test our appetite to want to do that and that may have an impact. but we're originating the vast majority of our cards in the super prime sector.
12;27;27;0;0.0;similar, yes. compared to the industry, our originations are skewed to the prime space. and our ltvs are lower and our durations are in line or lower.
12;28;107;2;0.018691588785046728;the biggest comment i would make is that there was a lot of volatility, particularly in china, in the second part of or the last part of the second quarter. we were -- we did pretty well. we helped our clients. we did not have significant open risk positions. we were not very directional. we were able to do well in that situation. also in the reversal, also on currency moves. it really is a comment i made about we're here to serve our clients, they were transacting, we were able to do risk intermediation in today for them and so we made money on both ends.
12;29;119;5;0.04201680672268908;let me just talk qualitatively for a second and we'll get you some numbers. but we're focused on mobile and digital primarily because it's going to be great for the customer experience, it's what our customers want. and also because it's a significant enabler for reducing cost to serve and improving efficiency. so we've been very focused on whether it's quick deposit, whether it's quick pay, whether it's our mobile wallet, whether it's our mobile app and we've been seeing great results. i'm off the top of my head not going to be able to tell you the penetration rates but we can get back to you.
12;30;53;0;0.0;i can tell you that we are growing our deposits nearly twice the industry. that we know. i think that's a reasonable indication for a bunch of different reasons and that we have a very highly rated app. i think the most highly rated bank app but we'll check that too.
12;31;63;0;0.0;on the fed funds and reverse repos, we had moved toward higher yielding, for example, emerging markets assets there. so we got some high yield there. we saw some yield on our trading book moving out of emerging markets. just a bit of puts and takes. on securities, was it significant? i'm sorry, i'll come back to you. operator, any more?
13;1;0;0;NA; .
13;2;90;2;0.022222222222222223;so, again, i would say that the pipeline coming into 2016 in m&a was good, solid, up, in fact. obviously, volatility can dampen the confidence of boards and ceos. dialogues are pretty active, and we think the types of deals that we'll see in 2016 will look different. but i think, in the first couple of weeks, it's not been particularly strong, and we do need to see some of the stability come back, i think, for us to really see that conversion start to pick up.
13;3;52;2;0.038461538461538464;yes, less mega-deals, more mid-sized deals, more cross border. it's a little different. actually, more deal count, less big mega-deals, could be very constructive for revenue, but we're likely to see it be a little bit different in 2016. but honestly, the pipeline is good, and -- yes.
13;4;19;2;0.10526315789473684;north america will be a tough comp. it was very strong in 2015, but europe could be very constructive.
13;5;209;1;0.004784688995215311;yes. so, the way we do our reserves, just for context, because i think it's important is, obviously the oil price outlook is important and instructive. and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and loss, given [default for] certain of our customers. but i think it's also the case, just for context, to know that it is very name-by-name specific. specific conditions at clients matter greatly. and so when we do these estimates, they are directionally correct, and order of magnitude correct. but that's just for context. oil -- we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel, and here we are, and stayed there for, call it, 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million. and that assessment has not fundamentally changed. so, it is not the current market expectation that oil will flatline. it is the expectation, right now, that there will be a modest recovery. based upon that, we would expect to take some additional reserves, but for them to be more modest, less significant. but that's the range SEMICOLON if oil's at $30 and stays here for a long time, up to $750 million.
13;6;317;0;0.0;i think, first, i'd say we try to be very conservative, always, and so we're not trying to put up as little as possible. you know me, i'd put up more if i could. but accounting rules dictate what you can do. and these are baskets of -- the real risk is in producing wells, cash flows are down. surprisingly, the cost of getting the oil out of the ground has also dropped dramatically, and probably much more than most of us would have expected. so, you take these producing wells, you take the cash flow, you discount it at 8% or 9%, you lend against it. and so these are our forecasts. and our energy book is not that large, relative to jpmorgan chase. we're not worried about the big oil companies. these are mostly the smaller ones that you're talking about these reserve increases on. i also think, mike, just -- and the forward curve is -- the end of the year, for 2016, i think is more like [$41] or [$42], or something like that. yes, it's [$48]. so, hey, mike, the other thing to know about the profile of reserves -- three things. the first is, it's not linear. so, just the oil price decline, and the decline in the forward curve that we saw into december and to the end of the year, that's the impact it had on our reserves. it's fallen significantly in the first two quarters. that was not a knowable condition, and we can not reserve for that at the end of the year. that's why we said we would expect to take some more reserve increases in the next couple of quarters. but again, it's a name-specific thing. and lots of other conditions at clients matter, including their hedging, their cash flows, the level of security, all those things.
13;7;3;0;0.0;we do not.
13;8;148;1;0.006756756756756757;first of all, the oil folks have been surprisingly resilient. and remember, these are asset-backed loans, so a bankruptcy does not necessarily mean your loan is bad. so, you have to be a little bit careful in -- and it's also, mike, a philosophical thing. a bank is supposed to be there for clients in good times and bad times. so, it's not a trading market, where you try to support clients. so, to the extent we can responsibly support clients, we're going to. and if we lose a little bit more money because of it, so be it. and we've done that around the world. we did it in 2007 and 2008 and 2009. we try to do it responsibly. if banks just completely pull out of markets every time something gets volatile and scary, you'll be sinking companies left and right.
13;9;276;1;0.0036231884057971015;yes, so, let me just deal with where we are against our targets. so, the most notable targets were $2 billion in the consumer businesses in 2017 versus 2014, and $2.8 billion in the cib in 2017 versus 2014. you probably heard my comment, but to clarify, on an apples-to-apples basis, we're halfway through on consumer. we've done $1 billion this year. you do not see that 100% translate into the results, partly because of legal expense, which is not something that we particularly can predict, and hopefully will not be there forever. also, because we intentionally decisioned in 2015, in the fourth quarter in particular, or mostly, to increase our investments in the consumer businesses by $150 million. so, we've achieved the $1 billion. we chose to reinvest a portion of it. another $1 billion we're on track for. we will potentially reinvest some of that, too. and gordon and we will talk to you about the basis for that at investor day. on the $2.8 billion in the cib, we're $1.3 billion through at the end of the year. and we talked before about the fact that the first $1.3 billion is largely on business simplification. we've had the revenue decline. we need to have the expense decline, and we've worked hard to deliver that, and we have. the next chunk is to do with technology and operations and infrastructure and organization, and it's harder. and so, we will continue with them on track to deliver it, but it's going to be a job through 2016 and into 2017.
13;10;68;1;0.014705882352941176;yes, i can give you some thoughts that will not totally satisfy you, which is our core expenses will continue to trend down, on the back of delivering against them. but we will make investment decisions that we think are good for the company, accretive for shareholders, that will re-spend some of that money. and so we'll give you that shrink and grow at investor day.
13;11;204;5;0.024509803921568627;so, just on nii, yes, we are seeing, embedded in that nii, flat to up slightly. we are seeing a nice lift associated with the rate hike in december across businesses, as well as the continued benefit of the mix towards loans in our balance sheet. but we were flatted in our nii this quarter by $178 million on securities gains in cio. so, that's going to mean the comparison is challenging, and then day count is obviously seasonal. so, that's the dynamic. we are seeing the rate benefit. we do expect to see it, as i said in my remarks, for the full year. look, we think we are appropriately conservative on deposit [beta's]. it is not -- it is way too early to have any idea. there's -- virtually nothing has moved yet. and so, our job, and what we are doing, is paying very close attention to the competitive landscape. these deposits that we're talking about, that have the high beta's, are valuable deposits with valuable clients for us, and we want to be competitive and pay fair rates. but it's so early in the movie that we have not changed much in our modeling assumptions.
13;12;173;2;0.011560693641618497;so, energy, metals & mining, we're watching very closely, industries that could have knock-on effects like industrials and transportation. but we're not seeing anything broadly, in our portfolio, right now. we're just watching very closely, which is why -- now, obviously, you can take our reserve build number, and you can say it's almost substantially all made up of oil & gas and metals & mining. and behind the scenes, we've had upgrades and downgrades of a number of other different companies, across sectors, but nothing particularly thematic yet. but we're watching. i would just point our that credit card, commercial bank, middle market, large corporate credit is as good as it's ever been. so obviously, it's going to get a little bit worse. i would not call it a cycle, per se. if you have a recession, yes, you will see a normal cyclical increase in all those losses. we're not forecasting a recession. we think that the us economy looks pretty good at this point.
13;13;382;6;0.015706806282722512;yes, so, look, we talked about achieving 4% last quarter, i think SEMICOLON and for disclosure, we were quite close to 3.5%. at that point, it becomes increasingly compelling to want to look at the margin, for what you could do to get within the bucket. and so that is what we did in the fourth quarter, is spend time really focusing on getting to that achievable boundary, which we thought at that point it was. and remember, it's not nothing, in the year, that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of non-operating deposits. and while there still could be some volatility in that number, of course, we've almost doubled that -- or doubled that, in fact. so, we got some wind to our backs in doing it. it's also the case that, when you get the entire business and company attuned to the sense of urgency and desire to want to be increasingly efficient in this way, that, at the margin, in a 100 different things, little benefits accrue. so, look, we're at about 3.5% -- we're just inside the 3.5% bucket, as best we estimate it. it's not as much important whether we're basis points or surcharge points below or above. it's much more what we do now to get safely in the bucket. and that's going to still take work. so that's why -- we'll obviously talk to you more about this at investor day. in terms of the give-up, from an economics perspective, we would not have done it at any cost. we have done it because we think it is important to do, because we think it's going to be constructive for the company, and because the revenue give-ups were not significant. but they were not zero, either. but to be able to reduce a constraint that is, in one way or another, likely to bind us -- or in multiple ways, in fact, likely to bind us, it was a, i think, very good trade. it was done, effectively, client by client. yes. to make sure we were trying to do the right things for our clients SEMICOLON not just jamming our balance sheet down and hurting people.
13;14;183;5;0.0273224043715847;the us economy has been chugging along at 2% to 2.5% growth for the better part of five years now. in the last two years, it has created 5 million jobs. if you look at the actual household formation -- car sales, wage, people working -- it still looks okay. corporate credit is quite good. small business formation -- it's not back to where it was, but it's quite good. household formation's going up. so obviously, market turmoil, we all look at it every day. but i'm not sure most of the 143 million americans look at it that much, who have jobs SEMICOLON and you have a big change in the world out there. people are getting adjusted to china slowing down. when you have commodity prices go down like that, there are big winners and losers. the oil companies are the losers SEMICOLON consumer is a benefit. brazil gets hurt. india benefits. south korea benefits. japan benefits. and those cause troubling waters. and hopefully, this will all settle down, and it's not the beginning of something really bad.
13;15;164;1;0.006097560975609756;okay. so our total reserves, on balance sheet, for metals & mining, or notwithstanding we built $60 million-odd this year, is over $200 million. so the coverage ratio is pretty good. the exposure is about -- i have not got the precise numbers in front of me. they're [about] a third the size of our exposure to oil & gas, so about 2% of our overall wholesale credit exposure SEMICOLON so, considerably more modest. which is why, if energy prices and general commodities weakness and stress stayed where it is right now, even for an extended period, we would think that the incremental reserves would be considerably more modest. and it's also -- that one is mostly name by name. yes, for sure. it's not big asset-based reserves. it's just -- they're big corporate credits, name by name. and for both oil & gas and metals & mining in our portfolio, oil & gas is close to 60% investment grade, and metals & mining about half.
13;16;173;4;0.023121387283236993;yes, so, with respect to home equity [re-class], remember, the majority of the problematic home equity underwriting was 2005 through 2008. so here we are, at the beginning of 2016, with [pig filling the python]. but we're monitoring it closely, and we have some re-class that have happened. obviously, interest rates are low. home price appreciation, on the other hand, is your friend. so there are puts and takes. we've been monitoring it, i would say, at the margin, or more than at the margin, at the early stages, coming in better than we had modeled. and remember, from an incurred loss perspective, we would consider these re-class risks to be largely incurred, so we've tried to reserve them, to the best of our ability. so we feel good about our reserve. i do not think we've disclosed them. but so far, from a performance perspective, i would say slightly better than our models. but we continue to monitor it, because it's still relatively early.
13;17;0;0;NA; .
13;18;286;3;0.01048951048951049;so obviously, you'll forgive me because we've been on calls since it came out. but, yes, we have been working on this for years. the problem with this particular rule is that, as you stated, based upon the four qis's that were done, there were some, i would characterize, significant challenges, with respect to the rules as written. and we were expecting there to be a number of meaningful changes, and there have been SEMICOLON in many cases, meaningful improvements. but it's very technical, and there's been a lot of changes, so we need to sift through it to figure out, net-net everything. although it is clear that net-net, despite the fact of the stated intention of the committee was not necessary to increase market risk capital across the industry, it will be higher. but by how much, it's really going to need to be sifted through. and for that same reason -- for both those same reasons, i'm sorry -- for the reason that the rule has not been stable and there have been significant questions, many of which have been either addressed or partially addressed, and many, i guess, that have not, it would have been premature to have taken any actions in advance of figuring out where this has landed. and, as you know, the period to comply is three years. so it's more of a start from here, to figure out how to manage with this, after we've sifted through the details. so, i wish i were able to give you a little bit more of a detailed answer, but we're going to need to take the time to go through it.
13;19;119;0;0.0;there are always actions that we can take to reduce the impact. and so, we have to think about them in the context of our overall capital optimization program. and, again, if there are -- if some of the things that we hoped -- and i -- honestly, i've been on calls since it came out. so, if some of the things that we hoped were going to be addressed have not, they could have had, or may have, meaningful impact on specific types of activity. and we will have to react accordingly. and, yes, we will take actions, if that's the right answer. i wish i could give you more details, but we just need to go through it.
13;20;0;0;NA; .
13;21;234;3;0.01282051282051282;yes, so, i would say that, based upon our fourth-quarter balance sheet, given that market risk was a driver, given that balance sheet levels was a driver, particularly on standardized, we could give back, on standardized, as much as 10 to 20 bps of capital, of the 10.7% capital accretion. but the bigger point, on the rwa outlook, is that we expect to be bound, over the medium term, by standardized. and standardized is going to always have a neutral to upwards pressure, as we continue to grow these high-quality loans. so, even though the rwa, being at the $1.5 trillion-ish sooner than we expected, is obviously good news. regardless of how much of that may, in the short term, revert, our job is going to be to continue to become more efficient, to try and keep it there, just given the natural upward pressure of the standardized calculations. we can become more efficient in advance, but we're unlikely to be bound by it in the medium term. so, that's what we're focused on. so, i would not take the $1.5 trillion, and read through that we'll be continuing to decline from here on standardized. we'll be continuing to work hard to make sure that we can grow those loans that we love, but that have (inaudible) [risk weights] under a standardized basis.
13;22;358;1;0.002793296089385475;okay. if i miss something at the end, remind me. in terms of how we think about buffers, just really conceptually, the firm manages, and the board has set for the firm, a risk appetite. that risk appetite has a number of features, and capital depletion in a stressed environment is one of them. and so, when we think about setting buffers, we think about it just broadly in the context of allowing ourselves enough room to absorb losses that are within our risk appetite, and not have to take premature actions, from a capital perspective. so -- but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent, at the 50-basis-point level, for a reasonable period of time. and we'll update you on all of that at investor day. with respect to our targets, it's a little bit more complicated than minimum regulatory capital, because as you say, we're bound, potentially, by multiple constraints, and one of them may be ccar. plus -- it is ccar, i should say. because as you know, the first two quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved. and we have not done ccar, so this is not any kind of prediction, but it would not surprise you to know that it's unlikely that we will pay out 100% of our earnings in ccar, going forward. so, we are on a path to continue to accrete capital, though we would like to move up in our pay-out range. so, given that we're still moving towards our 12% target, and we will update you if any of that changes at investor day. we're also, as you know, potentially going to understand whether or not the fed changes any of the ccar parameters, and whether that has an impact. so, at the moment, the best we know is that we're going to continue to accrete capital, albeit more slowly, as we hope to move up in the pay-out range, but we have not done ccar yet. and that's if the rules do not change. so, 12% it is for now.
13;23;163;0;0.0;it's both. so, think about -- in a [rate-sat] scenario, when you can pick whether you believe the market -- whether you think the market is -- or whether you believe the [fonc docs]. and i think it's going to be data dependent, so we're not going to have a stated opinion on that. but because of the mix in our balance sheet in 2015, as well as our expectation of continued loan growth, we would expect mix to contribute about half of that. and defer 25 basis points about the next half because we are more sensitive to the front end of rates in the first 25 basis points. and you can see that in our earnings and risk disclosures. so -- even if we see nothing else. now, obviously, we believe, and the market believes that you're going to see a couple more hikes. that would be, on average, another 25 basis points, and that would be incremental nii again.
13;24;82;0;0.0;i would say i would think about them in a somewhat similar directional way, given that our balance sheet ended below $2.4 trillion, a little bit of it market delivered, a lot of it purposeful. but we do intend to continue to gather deposits and extend loans, and while you're -- and portfolio loans, as well. so, while you will see some securities balances decline and the like, i would say again, net modest growth, but modest, and very lending driven.
13;25;147;2;0.013605442176870748;okay. so, in terms of the impact of rates, obviously there was a lot of monetary policy confusion. broadly, in the fourth quarter, the ecb underwhelmed the fed, was (inaudible). so there was a lot of confusion. but by the time the rate hike happened, it was obviously pretty well understood. we did see strong activity, or strong client activity, relatively speaking, on the back of that in the rates business, more so than necessarily about spreads. with respect to the fixed income business, we've always been very disciplined about how we think about the staffing levels and the expenses in that business. we've managed it very carefully. the compensation has come down across the trading businesses, and it would not surprise you that some of that -- a lot of that has been in fixed income. and our business is at scale and productive. so --
13;26;110;2;0.01818181818181818;you've seen, in fixed income -- we have a very good fixed income operation globally, around the world. rates themselves do not filter through ficc trading directly. i think what danny was talking about is, if you have healthy economies and confident investors, you have more volume in things like that. we do see a little bit of repricing taking place, in prime broker, repo, conduit, and some of those things run through ficc. so, that is going to take place as the world adjusts to all the new capital requirements. and obviously, there's a lot of seasonality in the business, which we've experienced for the last decade.
13;27;2;0;0.0;thanks, erika.
13;28;95;0;0.0;no, we've seen no real repricing in loans on the balance sheet. you have seen a little bit of -- people are getting other revenues to make up for their credit exposure. yes. think about the bank loans as being relationship loans that need to be in the context of [broader] relationship, and everybody is competing for them. they barely repriced in 2008 and 2009. banks were continuing to lend at the existing price. but that was because they -- these were long-term relationships. the bank loan market does not reprice like the markets do.
13;29;118;1;0.00847457627118644;we have not seen it. also, it's very, very competitive. everybody has been chasing these loans, and so that's a factor, too. so, we have not seen it yet. and then, if you -- the number in middle market lending, if i remember correctly, if you look at it by client, 60% of the revenues are not loan related. so, clients -- they also know what their relationship is to the bank. and while we need to make a good return on capital, the capital applied to the client is only partially loan related. and that capital, on its own, does not earn an adequate return. simple lending, on its own, is generally not an adequate return business.
13;30;199;2;0.010050251256281407;i think the better way to look at it is that people seem, in certain of our businesses -- and i mentioned those, and there are some other ones -- capital has been deployed, people have adjusted to the new rules, and you've seen pricing go up. whether it goes up a lot -- i would not count on it going up a lot more from there. the markets are going to be competitive at that point. but use of balance sheet, the cost has gone up SEMICOLON not loans, but most of the other stuff. and remember, we think about our prime brokerage business going hand in glove with equity. that's correct. and so, while the repricing is helpful, and does -- at the margin, everybody is going to continue to always observe their pricing. we've built our platform internationally SEMICOLON europe, we are seeing strong demand for our [synthetic pull-outs]. in asia, we're adding clients -- we've got the wind to our backs. so, it's an important business to our clients. you're right, there are some other people, potentially, not going to be as aggressive. and if we can take share, we certainly will.
13;31;36;1;0.027777777777777776;obviously, we expect any transition adjustment to go through equity. if we are able to adopt it early, we might do that. i'm not aware that we are. but i could be wrong about that.
13;32;176;0;0.0;so, yes, obviously, it was -- i think if you add up [cleared plus] other servicing rules, print them out, put them on the floor and stand them next to me, they're a foot taller. so they are very complicated. there's a lot of operational complexity to complying, and we're working very hard at doing that. i will say, in the quarter, we did -- as part of being cautious about making sure that we're complying, our cycle times were a couple days -- a few days worsened. and so, volumes, our origination volumes, are a little lower than we would have otherwise seen SEMICOLON not a lot. and that's just timing, and it's just days. but not really from a financial results perspective, because of the way we recognize the revenue. so, i would call it a little bit of teething problems -- across the industry, by the way, not just us -- nothing significant. we are going to get the work finished, and so it's tough, but it is what it is.
13;33;95;6;0.06315789473684211;yes, so, it's about 60% jumbo, 40% agency or conventional conforming, and it's a better execution decision. so, when we look at the better economics between selling or portfolio-ing the mortgage, we'll generally choose the better economics. but we also prefer the annuity nature of the nii -- the lower servicing risk, and the better capital efficiency. so, it has been the case, over the course of the last several quarters, that it has been the best execution to portfolio these mortgages. and actually, they are generating a nice return on equity.
13;34;155;2;0.012903225806451613;so we have had pretty big tax gains over the course of the last -- most notably, obviously, last quarter, over the course of the last couple of years. most of those related to the, call it, 2003 through 2008 tax periods, when we were going through the financial crisis. and so, some of the matters were more complex, and we took appropriate reserving decisions on that. there are many less of those very complicated matters ahead of us, and so we would not expect to see the same sort of size of tax benefits going forward as we've seen in the past. but we had some this quarter. so, we'll have a few. and generally speaking, they are, because of the nature of the reserving for tax, generally speaking, we take a conservative approach and the bias to the positive. but it could be much more plus or minus zero, at this point.
13;35;1;0;0.0;30%.
13;36;71;1;0.014084507042253521;so, do i think it's plateaued? i think it remains incredibly competitive in card generally, in particular in the co-brand space. so, plateaued at a very competitive level, i suppose. but in terms of -- i'm not going to talk about any specific names, actually, brian, in terms of the potential for repricing. it's an important part of our business, and we're going to defend our business.
13;37;90;0;0.0;it's a board decision, and so, neither have we received that guidance from the regulators, nor have we done ccar, and had that discussion yet with the board. but we have generally said that the board likes to have the flexibility to increase dividends over time, and we have had our dividend most recently at or close to that soft cap. so, we would love that capacity, and i would imagine that, over time, it may be used. but again, it is a board decision, not a management decision.
13;38;160;1;0.00625;from -- we do everything pro forma. so, first of all, i would say the following. right now, my understanding -- and if i'm wrong, forgive me -- is that it's your spot balance sheet two years prior that would drive your g-sib two years forward. but the reality, if you ask my opinion, given that we're going to be reporting quarterly going forward, and because of the likelihood that g-sib may or may not feature into ccar, i think it's going to be less important, necessarily, what you are at any one moment in time, but where you are projecting to be or stay. so, i suspect that we will get the benefit, potentially, of this, not today. we just closed our balance sheet. but i think that it's going to need to be a little bit more dynamic going forward, as it gets potentially introduced into stress test. but i do not know that.
14;1;255;0;0.0;so the first thing i'd say is with respect to oil and gas, obviously i think $529 million is pretty close to $500 million, plus or minus. so that was pretty much in line. but you are saying it'll be a little bit higher with metals and mining. we were expecting close to $100 million and there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter, and that kind of timing is going to happen. it does not change the overall sort of perspective for us. with respect to draws, when i gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve build, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws. and clearly we will work with borrowers to try and help them such that that may not be necessary, and in other cases we can reduce our exposure in redetermination cases. but we will expect to see draws and that's contemplated in our guidance. and i want to make sure that everyone understood that we tried to be very complete. so this is not just oil and gas and metals and mining, as the [mace] code would suggest. we've looked at very closely related companies in shipping and marine transportation and the like. so we're trying to be very complete. we've yet to take a loss. we have taken a couple. not very much.
14;2;120;0;0.0;so of the $1.2 billion, $1 billion was a combination of oil and gas and metal and mining, so the vast majority and outside of that, consistent with my comments on contagion, there's not any sort of thematic other noteworthy thing to mention to you. and obviously as we continue to watch the cycle play out over the next several quarters and reevaluate some clients that may be experiencing stress, it's likely that we will see some more mpls. but i gave you context around what we're expecting to see in terms of reserve. so they will go up, but not to numbers i would consider to be large in the context of our wholesale portfolio.
14;3;46;0;0.0;the draws are about $1.3 billion in the quarter. so some but not excessive. and after the reserves that we put up in the first quarter the coverage ratio is 6.3%. what is it on balance and stuff? that is the on balance sheet.
14;4;67;0;0.0;sorry glenn, just on that 6.3%, that's the firm. if you look in the commercial bank, obviously it's higher. so you've got a sort of a different portfolio mix in the commercial bank versus the cib. so if it's some parts of our portfolio it's closer to 9% or 10% and in other parts it's lower. sorry. your second question?
14;5;118;6;0.05084745762711865;it's a perfectly reasonable question. and obviously when we look at growth in cre, or the commercial real estate business, of 18% it's an obvious question, are you doing something different? and the answer is, no we're not. we have not changed our geographies, we have not changed our risk appetite. it just simply is the case that we have a good process and we are continuing to focus on our sort of core capabilities and our core risk segments. but we've been able to take advantage of the opportunity because our process is better, and to a lesser degree, but nonetheless to a degree, given that the cmbs market has been somewhat disrupted.
14;6;1;0;0.0;hi.
14;7;141;0;0.0;so betsy obviously, with having only received the specific feedback less than 24 hours ago we still have to get into the analysis phase about what it all means. i would start with your opening comment that considering our liquidity you were surprised. this does not appear to be a statement about the adequacy obviously of jpmorgan's liquidity, which is very significant, as you know. but it really about how we analyze and think about that at the material legal entity level and the inter-affiliate nature of how we formed our entity. so i can not tell you with any clarity exactly what will be required as we get into the analysis. it would not be my core expectation that it would require us to do a meaningful overall new liquidity actions, but we have to do the work.
14;8;246;5;0.02032520325203252;again, just based on our preliminary read, i think there's going to be significant work to meet the expectation of the regulators. and our plan already had us doing a lot of work around actual real simplification of legal entities and other things. so i do not know that there are going to be significant changes. it's not my primary expectation that there would be, but we do need to have a moment to go through the details. the liquidity of the company is extraordinary. we have $400 billion in central banks around the world, $300 billion of aa-plus short duration securities, just about $300 billion of very short-term secure -- really top quality repo or type of stuff like that. the trading book is $300 billion, which is mostly very liquid kind of stuff. so the liquidity of the company is extraordinary. i would say, just again, we need to do the work and we need to figure out obviously what the response to that will be. but it is encouraging that sometimes we're found to be credible for large systemic financial institutions. and if they have been able to adequately show their preparedness, we're confident we should be able to do the same. we just need to make sure that we understand the details of what it is that we do not have in our plan today that we need to change, and we're committed to doing it.
14;9;139;0;0.0;yes, absolutely. so i just wanted -- if you used the industry codes the way that you could if you want to expand your thinking to just what is technically considered to be an oil and gas company, you'd miss out on, for example, a marine shipping company that all they do is ship oil and therefore their financial and their performance is going to be directly related to the health of the energy sector. those companies we have identified them specifically, they are managed within our energy risk team. they are not managed by a different team. so i was simply saying that some of the companies that we are watching, and in one or two small cases that have experienced some stress, are not traditional energy companies. but their condition is directly related to oil and gas.
14;10;134;0;0.0;so obviously not for us. i would say that it's competitive, as the c&i space is very competitive. commercial real estate is also competitive, but it's not irrational. and we are not seeing, or at least we are not seeing very rational proposals on structure and risk. meanwhile we have not changed our risk appetite, we have not changed our underwriting standards. we continue to have lower ltvs and higher debt coverage ratios, pretty consistent geography. so speaking for jpmorgan specifically, there's been no change in our underwriting standards. in fact if anything since the last crisis, obviously the last recession, we tightened our underwriting standards and we've moved away from some of the riskier types of that business, so home builders and a lot of construction loan business.
14;11;389;4;0.010282776349614395;hey, mike. i'll start and then jamie can add to it. so on the interest rate point, the colors are pretty consistent with what we said over time, which is we have the belief that the us economy is continuing to move in the right direction, that the consumer is on solid footing, and that despite the noise in the data and some of the volatility in the market, global growth will continue albeit at a moderate pace. and obviously stability in the markets in march has continued to help us with that thesis. so that coupled with the fact that the fed themselves, while they are dovish in their narratives in the minutes and also they are [dots] are continuing to talk about gradual increases, and the debate around negative rates has kind of quieted. so we do not particularly run the company with a day-to-day view on what's going to happen with interest rates, we are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been. but we also understand what the performance of the company looks like if there are no more rate rises, or when we stress our portfolios in lots of different ways. so we are positioned for rising rates, it is our central case that will happen. the market is pricing less than one hike in this year. the fed dot says two. our research says two. we're just going to have to wait and see. i'll also start and then jamie can jump in on the living will thing. we have to take it at face value in discussions with our regulators that we need to meet their requirements, whatever they may be, all of the rules whether it's capital, whether it's liquidity, whether it's stress testing, whether it's resolution plans. and if we do that and satisfy them, then we can continue to operate the company the way that we think it is best for our clients and communities around the world. so at this point we need to remediate and address the issues and the feedback they've given us and resubmit a plan for assessment that we hope will be credible. and that's certainly what we will commit to do. and that's what we are focused on.
14;12;160;3;0.01875;well i do not think it's inconsistent. we're trying to meet all the regulations, all the rules and all the requirements. we've been doing that now for five or six years. what is it, six years since dodd-frank was passed. they had their job to do and we have to conform to it. i know it's easy to sort of overlook the quite a few statements where there's an acknowledgment that progress has been made. and none of the feedback in the letter negates the significant progress across the industry on capital liquidity stress testing. so it is consistent, but we have more work to do and we'll do it. on the interest rate stuff, i was not predicting it. i'm simply saying i think there's a chance it will be different than what people expect, and it will be a little -- i said it'll gradual until it's sudden.
14;13;0;0;NA; .
14;14;402;10;0.024875621890547265;so obviously we're the first to read out, and it's very difficult when you think about performance because you also have to think about the relative performance in the comparable periods and prior years and the like. so i would say that down mid-single digits adjusted for what we would consider to have been outperformance last year is really quite good performance. so i do not know that we gained share, but i certainly think we protected share, and it may differ across the different product sets. but i think in general we feel pretty good about our performance and we do not know anything to the contrary. i'd just add that $5 billion-plus of sales and trading in a quarter like this look as good, earning decent returns. we have good margins. we're not quite sure about share, but it was -- i would look as quite a good performance. and trading losses, while we, was it six days you said to me? six days, yes. six days, there was -- like $40,000. so that the actual results were just -- that's really good. i look at that as a very healthy business. and then with respect to the restructuring and whether that presents opportunities for us broadly [define], including in compensation for -- we pay for performance and we pay risk (inaudible) returns, and we're not looking to try and make changes to what we've been very consistent about over time. and you can see our comp-to-revenue ratio of 32% this quarter is in line with the ratio in the first quarter of last year, and in fact the first quarter of the year before. so lower -- obviously on lower revenues, but a fair pay for the performance. and obviously we intend to insure that we are competitive, but we're not going to take any direct actions as a result of that in terms of (multiple speakers) -- we've also got some big deals done near the end of the quarter in western digital and [newmar] cable, which is part of sales and trading. we also got -- we did this, i thought, a very creative chase, [what i would call], a chase trust in order to secure the first real securitization in a long time in the mortgage business, we do revenue risk-sharing, and i think it's quite good.
14;15;270;3;0.011111111111111112;on legal, the number is [circ] $0. pretax is actually slightly positive. after-tax we did some true-ups, assessments on penalty. so actually net/net about $0 this quarter, which i'll take it for the quarter but it does not necessarily predict the future. in terms of expenses, so we talked at investor day, gordon in particular but also daniel, that we are continuing to invest in our businesses. and across the board in fact adding bankers and technology and digital, digitizing, et cetera. so we continue to do that across the businesses and i mentioned in the ccb page that the net expenses, albeit down, includes self-funding $200 million of incremental investments year over year and growth. but you did notice the headcount in the consumer businesses is up slightly. and that's a combination of the investments we're making in technology and digital, that's about 500 of the heads and other 1500 is increasing part-time staffing in the branches so that we have flexibility to make sure that we have loading at the right times of day for making sure the customer experience is good. so i would characterize it all as very consistent and yes, we continue to invest. and that is in part what you're seeing in the headcount in ccb. and you saw new credit card freedom unlimited 1.5% back. we're doing a lot of stuff in chase pay. so the starbucks thing, we apply the top digital side, and we continue to win awards in the consumer bank. so we'll always be investing there.
14;16;147;2;0.013605442176870748;so it is our expectation across both the consumer and the wholesale businesses outside of energy that the credit trends will remain favorable, or credit will be relatively benign. we're not expecting to see material increases, except for the fact that we are growing our loan portfolio. so when we did investor day we talked about charge-offs this year will go up year on year, and they will go up to potentially as high as $4.75 billion. but half of that would be on the back of the fact that we are growing our portfolios. so you'd just have natural sort of bau levels of charge-off from that and then the other half would be on energy. so we're not expecting or seeing at this point anything, other than good credit quality for the rest of 2016, outside of the obvious.
14;17;210;3;0.014285714285714285;so i will start by saying that as you know our regulators have extraordinary powers over a wide range of requirements for us regardless, and many ways of influencing those and you're familiar with most of them. it is absolutely the case that as you look at the resolution process that there are provisions that talk about if remediation is not satisfactory with, or cured within a two-year period, there are - there's a possibility that the regulators could jointly decide, may jointly decide, to take other actions that could include capital or liquidity or leverage or operating model discussions. so obviously they do have those powers. october is not that far away. we're going to do our very, very best to make sure that we put our best foot forward and remediate the issues and then we have another submission in july 2017. so not to suggest that we will not fully remediate them to the very best of our ability, but the living will process i expect to continue to be somewhat iterative over the next several cycles, and we continue to push ourselves to raise the bar. and i'm certain that the bar will continue to be raised on us, as it should.
14;18;1;0;0.0; , matt.
14;19;158;0;0.0;okay. so we talked about the fact that if there's no change in rates and if we continue to grow our loans, we would expect our nii to go up by $2 billion. so you're right, if you look at the run rate right now that would be relatively flat from here. i think in our favor, because of the easing that's still going on around the rest of the world and the sort of the dovish fed comments, there's been a lower re-price just in the industry generally. so that's in our favor and we're much more sensitive to the front end of rates. so we're not suggesting that the long end of the curve has no impact, it's relatively modest. so $2 billion, maybe a little more. the biggest driver of significantly higher nii above that guidance would be if we had another hike earlier than december.
14;20;46;0;0.0;so not going to talk specifically about the treasuries' actions, other than saying that we would support fed tax reform in general. with respect to the impact on our business, either historically or going forward, it would not be zero and it would not be significant.
14;21;268;2;0.007462686567164179;okay. so obviously i'm not going to be able to talk specifically about our plans that we've submitted because we just submitted them and we have not had any feedback and they are confidential, but i will tell you that obviously negative rates, it was the first time this has been in the scenario. it's not the first time we have thought about it, and it is not the first time that we've experienced it, and at least in other parts of the world in europe, japan and elsewhere. so we have had strategic discussions, we understand broadly what we think we would do and what would happen to our balance sheet. we can model it and we can effect it. so in that sense, now i mean obviously, we'll continue to work that process through if it continues to be a feature of ccar. you're absolutely right that year over year our launch point is a higher level of capital and our balance sheet and our credit quality continues to improve, and our risk levels have not materially changed. so as a general matter we would hope, and we've also added [press]. so as a general matter we would hope to have incremental capacity but nothing inconsistent with what we have said externally, which is that the board would like over time to continue to have the capacity to potentially increase dividends and that we would likely the capacity to, within a reasonable range, repurchase our stock. and that's the framework that we have used to submit our plan.
14;22;0;0;NA; .
14;23;214;2;0.009345794392523364;so if i do the -- i do not want to use the word call, if i adjust for the full impact of the asset sale that was in the quarter not just the $150 million in this quarter but also the revenues that were present with respect to that in the first quarter of last year, my adjusted revenues are down about 4% to a market that on average, while i appreciate that it recovered in march, but the market on average for the quarter was down around 5%. so we would characterize that as generally in line. and similarly if you do adjustments on the balance sheet side, the assets under management and client assets. so certainly you can speak to jason afterwards and reconcile our numbers so that we're not confusing each other. i'm sorry what was the second part of your question? retail engagement. so retail engagement picked up in march, as you would expect. we saw positive flows. we obviously saw negative flows for the quarter in equities, that's not surprising. and then we saw positive flows, particularly in multi-asset. so we did see some reasonably healthier retail flows in the quarter, but primarily in march, and some were offset by outflows in equities. thank you.
14;24;59;3;0.05084745762711865;as luck would have it, in this quarter there is nothing one-time that you need to adjust for. last quarter there obviously was. so we would expect that our nim should be stable to improving over the course of 2016. the extent to which it would improve, obviously depending upon what happens in term of gradual rising rates.
14;25;95;2;0.021052631578947368;okay. so with respect to equity capital raises, i mean obviously to a degree that would be true, although those companies that were able to access the equity markets are not those that are experiencing the most stress. so obviously all other things equal it's a positive, but i'm not necessarily thinking it's going to take significant steam or the pressure off. with respect to second part of your question i'm so sorry? the c&c. jason will get back to you. i'm sorry, i do not have the answer.
14;26;133;5;0.03759398496240601;okay. so no, nothing has changed in the card competitive landscape, including in co-brands. it's still very competitive, albeit that we saw a little bit of deceleration in sales growth year over year last year and we've seen that trend back positively for us this year. so we feel good about that and we've been increasing our marketing spend and as jamie did say, we launched freedom unlimited quite recently and it has been quite recent, but early feedback is very positive. with respect to freedom with a 50% increases in activity and interest, there's going to be a degree of cannibalization of other products, we would expect that. but so far, so good. and we just like to give our customers choices. and its been favorably received.
14;27;131;1;0.007633587786259542;so the manheim is down slightly. we continue to believe and expect that it will continue to trend downwards and so [also seeing] it will continue to trend upwards, just given where it is today and also the amount of leased inventory that will ultimately go into the used car space over the course of the next several years. however the fundamentals are still good, the market is still solid. we have pulled back on subprime a while ago. it's a small part of our originations. so other than seeing some delinquencies tick up, as expected, in some of the energy-related states but not very significantly, there's nothing at the moment that's on the burner. for us. i do think you'll see issues in the market.
14;28;43;1;0.023255813953488372;so the msr p&l for the quarter was a positive $124 million, and they are a combination of bau and material factors that added up to that, and probably about half of it was a combination of hedge performance and the market.
14;29;34;1;0.029411764705882353;yes, yes. so purchase applications are up 30%, i think, year on year. we continue to be positive momentum in that space, and we are seeing spring activity continue to be robust, as expected.
14;30;221;4;0.01809954751131222;okay. so in terms of run rated, the two biggest drivers of the walk that we gave at investor day were the card co-brand renegotiations and the mortgage banking non-interest revenue. i would just point out that while we are seeing some of the incremental impact of card renegotiation, that will play out over the course of the year. but on the positive side -- and on the positive side mortgage banking, just given where rates were over the quarter, has been positive relative to central expectations when we did investor day. so those two things are worth noting. but we are seeing really quite good drivers in non-interest revenue drivers across the consumer space generally, in debit investments, in fees and accounts, in the sort of 4%, 5% range, and sometimes in the range higher than that. so we are continuing to see exactly what we expected, which is the majority of our businesses will continue to deliver mid- to high single digit growth, and they seem set to do that. the card impact will be what it will be, and mortgage nii will end up down year over year, whether it's $700 million or $600 million we'll see. and so the biggest driver of what the end result will be is going to be markets.
14;31;116;1;0.008620689655172414;yes. look, the business is not immune to markets either. so obviously as you look at the performance for the quarter our fees have been impacted by low asset levels. and we also have got the tail impact of some business simplification, just getting the tail of that out of the performance. we are also seeing the benefit of higher rates. so i'd characterize the majority of those negatives on lower fees and simplification as being behind us. so the trajectory, if rates continue to rise, would be upwards. but that's why we said market dependence. we were not expecting our performance to go down from here. flat to up, but depending on rates.
14;32;70;1;0.014285714285714285;so -- i'd just use 32%. we've given a range 30% to 35%. we've been at the lower end of that range. when we performed very strongly we could drift up. if we perform less strongly, we pay for performance and i think we did a good job in the first quarter. we have among the lowest ratio. we're paying our people properly and well. and consistently.
14;33;184;7;0.03804347826086957;that's very fair. and we've talked about it pretty often, that people when they restructure, they restructure out of the things that they were less strong at, less comfortable at, and in many cases they double down where they continue to have strength. and we are seeing that. and that's what we mean when we say there's always someone left to fiercely compete in every part of our business, and equities is no exception. it's not the poster child for that. however, the equities business here at jpmorgan, we've rebuilt our technology platform. we have rebuilt the prime -- we've built the prime brokerage, international capabilities. the two of those work hand in glove. and we have every opportunity to continue to gain share and win. and we've done very well gaining share in electronic trading and the prime broker has been built in asia and europe where we had weaknesses. so you've seen our share go up and we intend to win it. we have topnotch research, which obviously helps drive the equity business too.
14;34;93;0;0.0;that's correct. give or take, and that's right. obvious are there's a high degree of variability around it. if we had complete ability to understand it we would lean into those reserves. but it's name specific and situation specific, it would evolve over time. we just wanted to give you an indication that there's likely to be some more costs. it could be plus or minus quite a bit from that because we've had to make stress assumptions in there. but $500 million for nine months, yes.
14;35;29;0;0.0;yes. no gerard, i'm not going to make any comments about snc, except to say that everything that we know and aware of is reflected in our results.
14;36;2;0;0.0;correct. yes.
14;37;16;0;0.0;they changed by a couple of billion dollars on a single name that we like, up.
15;1;1;0;0.0; , brian.
15;2;115;0;0.0;brian, i know that everybody is keenly interested to hear what we have to say, but the truth of the matter is it's very, very early days. the new government is just forming as we speak. negotiations need to be given some time to unfold and take shape. so it's really too early to hypothesize. we would hope that we can continue to operate the way we are right now. but we will just continue to evaluate the landscape, as i'm sure you will, over the coming weeks, months and quarters, and plan accordingly. the most important thing is that we intend to continue to support our european franchise and clients throughout.
15;3;307;1;0.003257328990228013;so, on the card space, as you know, we have loans running off. we're replacing them all of the time. over the course of the last couple years, since the end of 2013, we made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully. and we've been monitoring them very closely. and what we're seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations. and these loans are coming on at higher risk-adjusted margins. so, the roes are at or above the portfolio roes. so, nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectations for our credit risk appetite. and with respect to auto, not to speak for others, but obviously when you look at lower fico scores and high ltvs and longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and they're likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. and so we've been very, very thoughtful about that, not just today but as we've been going through the cycle. and not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of ltvs and fico scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in -- and low percentage of subprime origination -- very, very careful about looking at those layered risks. so nothing in our -- and remember, for auto this year, i think the charge-off rate's going to be 40-ish basis points compared to a long-run average of more like 60. we're sort of reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. and used car prices will ultimately come down, and we're being thoughtful about that.
15;4;1;0;0.0; , jim.
15;5;139;1;0.007194244604316547;at the risk of not getting like overly complicated, the long-term debt expense -- our nii was flat with loan growth. and nii on loan growth being offset by long-term debt expense, which was largely to do with the hedging of non-dollar debt and just relative quarter-over-quarter small moves in currency levels and currency basis. so, i would honestly characterize it, not to sort of underplay it, as quarter-over-quarter noise. looking forward -- so when you look at our nim, you have nii flat. you have the balance sheet growing, as we expected, both on loans and trading assets. so, nim just naturally is down a few basis points. but we would be looking for nii to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter, and for our nim to be relatively stable.
15;6;173;0;0.0;so, i would say there's going to be two things. first of all, obviously when you talk about consumer, it kind of gets dwarfed by card. so let's start with card. we are growing the portfolio. we added 4% core loans year over year in card. so naturally, as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserves. so there will be some of that, but i would characterize it as modest. and then, as these vintages continue to season, we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates at circa 2.5%. they will trend up slightly. so there will be a little bit of rates impact, too, but again, as i say, with very accretive roes. i would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors, but for all the right reasons. and similarly, volume-wise in auto we should see some adds, but again, in comparison to card, modest.
15;7;94;1;0.010638297872340425;so, as you know, erika, everything that we do, we do with a view to, first of all, the client franchise and making sure that we're supporting our clients. and then secondarily, with a view to all of our binding constraints. we will provide capital and access to the cib. but also take into consideration our overall objective of making sure that we stay in the 3.5% g-sib bucket. so we will continue to try and find capacity to be able to recycle it and grow high-roe/high-roa business.
15;8;51;3;0.058823529411764705;not anything significant, no. i think you've got to compare it to the prior year, which was stronger, particularly this time last year in asia. and that's less true today -- stronger in europe, less strong in asia. it's more of a regional story than any particularly significant items.
15;9;1;0;0.0; , betsy.
15;10;166;3;0.018072289156626505;yes. so let me -- two pieces to the story. yes, the guidance is $2 billion-plus year on year. you'll recall when we came in to investor day, we said we would expect $2 billion, rates flat. it looks like rates will be flat, at least in the front end at this point, at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year. you've seen already in the first two quarters that year over year we're up $1.4 billion. we were doing better than that on a combination of lower deposit bases reprices and also on strong loan growth. but if you annualize that, that would be too high. we are going to have some impact in nii of the lower 10-year. it's not significant. but it will offset that to a degree. we would expect our nii to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion up year on year -- largely strong loan growth, low reprice.
15;11;151;0;0.0;i would say we've been doing a combination. we've been growing our deposits more strongly than the industry. so we continue to be net-net attracting more deposits than the industry, and also, as you say, a mix shift out of securities and into loans. our outlook for loan growth through the remainder of the year is to be at the higher end of our range. we said 10% to 15% core loan growth, and at this point, demand still seems robust. so we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. we certainly have been this quarter. so at this point i would say that it's a combination of factors. and remember that the way we think about our investment securities portfolio also takes into consideration how we think about positioning the firm's duration of equities. so all of those factors will contribute.
15;12;154;1;0.006493506493506494;if i get this wrong, i apologize. but i think it was actually we make $3.5 billion on the rates implied and $6 billion on normalized rates. but in any case, let me just talk about rates flat versus implied right now. and just because things can change so quickly, let's just focus on 2017. rates flat from here. so, with the 10-year at about 1.5% and ioer at 50 basis points, because of the loan growth, notwithstanding any sort of long-end pressure, we would still expect year over year our nii next year to be up between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, implied, which is actually not that much different from that. so it does have about 20 basis points better long-end rates by the end of 2017, but otherwise relatively flat through the end of 2017 would be about $0.5 billion more than that.
15;13;177;4;0.022598870056497175;growing like a sunflower, not like a weed. look, i'll say a couple of things. the first is, a lot of that growth is commercial term lending. and it is the case that we have the technology and a process that has speed and certainty of execution, and competitive funding costs. so it is the case that it's a value proposition that we're able to bring to clients, i think, that differentiates us. we're able to close in times that are a fraction of what the industry is. secondarily, we're really concentrated on identified, supply-constrained markets, low-rent stabilized. so these are not the same properties that had problems in the past. we have -- since the previous cycle, we have looked carefully at our underwriting, and there are some things and some regions and some products that we either do not do or do significantly less of. so we're very, very careful. but we're looking at some really good credit quality in our commercial real estate portfolio right now.
15;14;150;1;0.006666666666666667;so i would say in the cib, it's also a revenue story. so you need to consider both factors (multiple speakers). so let me talk about where we are on the expense commitments. and you'll recall that -- whether you remember a $4.8 billion number or a $5.5 billion number in total, we're about 70% of the way through delivering against that across the cib and the ccb at the end of the second quarter, and we continue to make progress. in the ccb, obviously, it is generally more progressive. and in the cib, it's a bit more about technology and operations, and it takes some time to deliver that. but fundamentally we continue to chug through that. and we will get there over the course of the next several quarters. so i would say in line with our expectations, and is a contributing factor.
15;15;63;0;0.0;so i would say the comp-to-revenue ratio is an outcome, just for what it's worth. obviously we try to give the range to give people an idea. we pay competitively and we pay for risk-adjusted performance. but there's nothing notable going on. we've been actually at the lower end of our range for a little while now.
15;16;139;2;0.014388489208633094;so it's always a little tricky. the share thing is going to become clearer with a rear-view mirror than it is necessarily at a moment in time. it does feel like we are doing fairly well competitively, not just against european banks, but just generally. and not just in europe, but generally, because we, as you say, have continued to be there for clients across products, across the globe. so i would say that we feel like we are doing fairly well. we'll know whether that is share gains when we are able to actually look at that in the rear-view mirror. but there's still plenty of competition out there. so we're just focused on serving our clients the right way. but it does feel a little bit like we're doing well.
15;17;350;2;0.005714285714285714;i'm going to try to tell you as best i can, if you can hear me. so, number one, we do think it will reduce the gdp, the uk and the eu, a little bit. and obviously that's not going to affect our business plans. that will affect the economies a little bit. number two, we know it's going to create uncertainty for an extended time period. so we do not think we can answer or make certain all these things you want to know because there are a lot of parties involved. we are hoping that the political leaders are very sensible. it makes sense for both the eu and for britain to think through the process to make it sensible, whatever changes they make, to give businesses time. i'm talking about years -- time to adjust to the new reality, which we do not know what it is. i think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients day in and day out. if it adds extra cost, so be it. i'm not really worried about it. it would be nice if it does not create huge turmoil. i'm hoping the eu is sensible, but we're going to be prepared. as marianne mentioned, there's a range of outcomes. any one (inaudible) we'll try to be prepared for each one of them. we're not going to, like, pull back on serving people in italy, germany, france, uk or spain because it might lead to higher costs. i would accept the higher cost, as opposed to disrupt our clients. i would also point out, mike, that competitively we are not in this situation alone. and so we're going to take our time to work out what the right course of action is. and obviously we'll update you as and when that becomes clearer. we're not going to be at a competitive disadvantage. if anything, as we talked about earlier, we feel like we're in a position of strength.
15;18;271;5;0.01845018450184502;the truth of the matter is, it's a bit early to say for that, too. i hate to continue to repeat that. i will tell you that, generally speaking, uncertainty is not particularly conducive or constructive for m&a. but in this case, i think there are some offsets. so i would start with, in terms of the actual strategic dialogue with ceos and at the boardrooms, it is as good as it's ever been. if you think about the other factors that would be supportive of m&a, like cheap financing globally, low organic growth, good multiples, solid economy in the us and globally notwithstanding a bit of the steam taken out in europe or the uk, all of that should continue to be supportive for strategic m&a. at the end of the day -- and currency could be supportive of cross-border activities. so there are puts and takes. i'm certain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do. at the end of the day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases. and similarly, volatility, generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ecm, but investor appetite is still there, and there have been deals priced post-brexit. it's a little early. there's still activity. volatility is reasonably subdued at this point. and i think, because there are no event calendars out there right now, there's still quite a lot of opportunity in the space. obviously, dcm, low rates would be a tailwind, notwithstanding the m&a and ecm landscape.
15;19;104;0;0.0;so i'm going to start with the second part of the question. so we are still very much concentrated in the prime and near-prime space, but we have a higher percentage of our origination in the near-prime space, reasonably meaningfully higher over the course of the last couple years. so where we may have previously been, i think 40%, above 760. now that's less than that, and there's more like 20% or 30% below 700. by the end of the day, still pristine credit, relatively speaking. with respect to delinquencies, is it a cure rate issue? not specifically, no.
15;20;126;4;0.031746031746031744;we're not really doing much in the way of 2017 guidance right now. it will ultimately honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers. i think we're at a very good run rate of investments. we've increased reasonably significantly in terms of marketing dollars and also lease growth. that will drive profitability in the medium to longer term. so it's possible, if we see the opportunity to continue to do that, we would do it. but we have no specific guidance yet. revenue environment can change reasonably quickly, particularly, as you know, with rates, and to a lesser degree, markets. we're not going to overreact to a short-term phenomenon.
15;21;26;1;0.038461538461538464;yes, taxes much -- generally speaking, the reserve changes are somewhat episodic. outside of those, yes, 36% is a good central case for our managed tax rate.
15;22;0;0;NA; .
15;23;204;4;0.0196078431372549;so starting with the qualification that obviously, as you suggested, it's going to be market dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave the guidance that we would expect the second half to be seasonally lower. so here's what i would say -- first half, market challenged SEMICOLON second half, markets better. net-net, first quarter markets challenged SEMICOLON second quarter better. net-net, first half relatively flat year over year. so, call it a wash, with the acknowledgement that we knew we would expect seasonal declines in the second half of the year. mortgage better -- so you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year on year, actually by a reasonably significant amount. given obviously where the rate environment is, as well as some positive msr results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat. and against that, to your point, lower ib fees and lower asset management revenues, given the environment. the way i would characterize it is there are puts and takes, but net-net it's still a reasonable central case. so we are not changing it. but it's market dependent.
15;24;386;2;0.0051813471502590676;so i would say if you look at the last three years of ppnr, notwithstanding that there have been obviously differences in the scenarios, 2015 ccar results, so not this year's but last year's, were low. not to say that means that these results are more normal. i would say if you look at the three years and look at the ppnr results now, it's more consistent with the sort of portfolio risks, revenue generation we would expect. and you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results. so i do not have insights that i can share with you specifically to try and reconcile the fed's results year on year, nor do we really try to do that. you're right -- operational risk is likely a piece of it. and that was disclosed in that information. so i would just say, there can be volatility but i feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think the ppnr would start, and it's consistent as you can see, relatively speaking with what we calculated. in respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does mean is if you look at the analysis that we've done a couple of years in a row now, where we've said using the ccar results from the fed, what would that imply a cet1 ratio would need to be to pass, it had previously been a little less than 11%. with the improved ppnr and, therefore, the improved result, at this point, it would be a little less than 10%. so in that context, as we sort of look forward, sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter, to getting the sort of 2017 ccar changes in proposed form hopefully, it will alleviate to a degree a little bit of that pressure. but i still would suggest to you, as we said at investor day, that ccar may, depending on how the g-sib surcharge is included in the minimum, may become binding, if not likely will become binding. and so we'll continue to take that into consideration as we go forward. and we are already taking it into consideration as we think about optimizing against the multiple binding constraints we have.
15;25;83;1;0.012048192771084338;we think about using all of our channels based upon obviously the demand, and our capacity and our appetite to want to continue to close strongly for our customers. we've obviously also been focused in the anticipation of it becoming a more purchase-oriented market very much on building out the retail channel and the retail distribution channel, and that's been very successful. so there's less correspondent contribution this quarter. it is a lever we will likely use going forward.
15;26;120;1;0.008333333333333333;at this point, i'd still say -- at this point, we would still say it will be episodic. and while we are hopeful that the overall structural costs will start coming down, or has come down, and that's a good thing, there will still be potentially some puts and takes in the legal space. there's no real way obviously of forecasting a run rate. i would just do what many of you have done, i think, and go back and look at what the legal expense looked like in the years preceding the crisis, and make your own determination whether it's going to be structurally a little higher. but it probably would not be multiples of that.
15;27;160;3;0.01875;okay. so it was particularly strong in rates, but nevertheless also very strong year over year in currencies, emerging markets, credit trading, [spg]. so it was pretty broad-based. but remember, you also have to think about it relative to the equivalent course of last year, and we did not have a particularly strong second quarter last year. so on a relative basis, that is an important factor, but it was pretty broad-based -- more volume than anything. and then seasonality, i'm sorry -- look, it's anyone's guess. i think you can go back and look over time. but last year we saw -- we had a weak second quarter, as i said. so we did not see as much seasonality. but if you look at the last quarter's run rate, i do not know that would be a bad place to start -- last year's third quarter run rate would not be a bad place to start.
15;28;175;3;0.017142857142857144;i'm going to start with a couple of general comments, which is, we talked about the fact that the charge-offs that we've experienced in the quarter were credits that we had previously reserved for. so we're at the point now where at least as a sort of basic matter as we're experiencing charge-offs, we feel like we're in a reasonably good reserve position, notwithstanding that idiosyncratically there may be additional adds. what we would need to see is continued firming of sentiment in the sector, continued access to capital markets to allow companies to repair their balance sheets, and continued stabilization if not improvement in oil and gas prices. and so everything is constructive on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path. and yes, we are growing our portfolio. and so even if it were not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves, but there are also time to (inaudible) pay down -- a lot of puts and takes, too.
15;29;134;4;0.029850746268656716;so, i mean, just to say -- we obviously have our own spend data to look at, and it continues -- the card spend is up 8% year on year. energy continues to be a tailwind for consumers. the labor market continues to be solid and improving. and sentiment is still good. housing, still improving. so i mean, really just looking at the same things you're looking at, and we obviously have a slightly different lens to it. but all other things equal, consumers are in very good shape, and demand is there for the product. and we've been investing outside of consumer in new products -- inside consumer, sorry -- in the freedom unlimited space and also in marketing. we're growing, not only because the demand is there but also because we're investing.
15;30;32;0;0.0;our second-quarter results reflect everything that we have and we know of at the end of the quarter. and we're not going to make any specific comments on regulatory exams.
15;31;33;0;0.0;not specifically. i'm not sure SEMICOLON i have not polled the dealers myself. we continue to have very high fico scores. i'm not aware of that, but i can not comment.
15;32;7;0;0.0;in our portfolio at this point, no.
15;33;34;2;0.058823529411764705;so we are expecting refi to be stronger in the coming quarters SEMICOLON and the mortgage market, as best we can tell, will be at around $1.7 trillion, $1.8 trillion this year.
15;34;78;2;0.02564102564102564;so we've done one, and we're looking at more securitizations in the mortgage space. and we are keeping a vertical stripe. we're retaining the loans on our balance sheet -- or the securities on our balance sheet, i should say. and in doing that we've been able to get private capital to take the majority of the lower credit risk and get better capital treatment for ourselves, in terms of the rwa that it attracts.
15;35;2;0;0.0;new originations.
15;36;132;0;0.0;i'll just start by sort of orientating you on why that would be the impact for us. if you look at our balance sheet and you look at what we have in fixed rate loans versus what we have in either ioer or in libor loans, it's about $650 billion. so we're much more sensitive to the front end of the rate curve. if you look at our earnings at risk disclosures, a 100-basis-point parallel shift would be around $800 million. and so obviously we have not seen, and will not hopefully see, anything of that order of magnitude. that kind of gives you an ability to size up, notwithstanding compounding, why you've only seen our nii relative to prior expectations come down by that much.
15;37;87;1;0.011494252873563218;so i think earlier on the call somebody else asked the question, and i made the comment that it's really more related to the results from our hedges of non-dollar debt, long-term debt. and so in the first quarter, the dollar weakened. in the second quarter, it strengthened. and with some currency basis in the first quarter that we did not see in the second quarter, it really is, not to dismiss it, but it really is accounting and nothing really else than that.
15;38;47;1;0.02127659574468085;no shift from our desire to want to be with engaged customers and our rewards programs. our products are all geared towards that. so it's really just a credit decision. and, yes, we do have relationships with many, many customers in that still near-prime space.
15;39;321;12;0.037383177570093455;yes. so look, obviously p2p real-time payments is very important to our customers, so therefore it's important to us. it's also important for us on the industry that it's done in a safe and secure way. and so early warning, the fraud protection that they are able to provide, as well as bank-level cyber security and the absence of a need to provide your bank credentials we think is very strongly positive for our customers. and we expect to see volume go across that. as you know, we have quickpay already, and we saw reasonably significant volume, $21 billion, on quickpay last year and growing. so i would expect to see more and more p2p payments. and it's good for our customers, it's good for us. if you look at the whole payment space, chase paymentech is gaining share. chase net is doing very well. chase pay, we've signed up lots of different people. one piece of that is the p2p. today, right now, if you use chase quickpay, it's very easy within chase to chase. it's now just as easy to go from chase to a bunch of other banks, who i will not name now. we've just started rolling out -- it's soon to be rolled out to 60% of american banking accounts. and then we're going to make it available to all banks. so you will be able to go p2p, real time, through chase quickpay, there will be a special app for chase quickpay. it'll also be branded under another name, which we have not rolled out yet, which i think will be rolled out shortly. i think it's a great success that the banks can get together and do this. this will be great service, which i think shows you the banks making progress on what you would have called prior fintech.
16;1;230;3;0.013043478260869565;so i think there's three or four things to mention. the first is that i would say that the industry generally had a pretty weak third quarter last year. and so when you think about the year-over-year comparison we are a little flattered by last year's performance. not necessarily more so than our peers, but nevertheless we are. then we talked about the fact that this quarter the conditions were relatively favorable broadly and compare and contrast that to last year where there were pockets of activity and client flow but there were also pockets where people were really sitting on their hands and not transacting. so i think client flow quite broadly across the environment would characterize the quarter. in terms of the competitive performance i would say it feels like we did well. obviously, we're the first to report, apart from citi this morning. it feels like we did relatively well, so we may have gained some share. certainly, hopefully the momentum in terms of the business we've been building and the way we are serving our clients will service in that capacity, not just this quarter but through time. but, obviously, there can be a bit of volatility in the market share space. so we prefer to look at it more through time and we feel pretty good about the performance.
16;2;97;2;0.020618556701030927;so i would say we do not specifically target a competitive set. but i will tell you that our balance sheet, we talked about it many times on this call before that we do have the capacity to put our balance sheet and our resources to work for our clients, for our best clients. and we think about using those resources in the context of overall relationships. so if any period is more leverage constrained and has less access we may have competitive advantage. and certainly we will continue to make those resources available to our clients.
16;3;240;1;0.004166666666666667;so i do not know, glenn, if you recall that we had a bit of discussion about this last quarter and guided to the fact that we would expect to see our loss rates go up slowly, partly because, obviously, at 250-ish basis points i think we could call that pretty low historically. but also because over the course of the last couple of years we have been changing the mix of our originations a bit to the prime, near prime space, still completely within our credit risk appetite and at risk-adjusted margins that are better than the portfolio average. so we are getting paid for that. so we are doing it within our risk appetite, doing it judiciously. but as a result, as those vintages become a higher percentage of our overall population they will have a gentle upward pressure on the charge-off rate. so what we are seeing in terms of the delinquency uptick and the charge-offs, gradual increases completely in line with how we underwrote those loans and our expectations. and so as you look forward for us over the course of the next several quarters and we would expect those phenomena to generally continue, again, slowly. we are growing our portfolio, we are going to see the seasoning of those vintages as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned cause us to build a reserve but for the right reasons.
16;4;10;0;0.0;no, nothing significant, glenn. no significant changes to our sensitivity.
16;5;97;2;0.020618556701030927;so i would say that all of the things that you mentioned, whether it's closed loop network, whether it's our new proprietary products, whether it's our investments in the technology platform and the business in merchant services are all at good returns that ultimately will drive the business to be profitable in the future as it has been in the past. so we have not given specific guidance for roe targets for this business but nothing has changed over the medium term for what we think that the performance of the business would be.
16;6;26;2;0.07692307692307693;yes, it's a very competitive business and it's very profitable. so all other things being equal, we would like to continue to gain share.
16;7;209;5;0.023923444976076555;so we have not given specific cost guidance going out beyond this year at this point. but our objective will remain consistent with those that we stated previously which is we continue to try and become more efficient across our businesses. as you know, we are at the tail end but not finished on a couple of large expense programs in our largest businesses so that we create capacity to be able to invest in the businesses broadly, whether that's in products, in marketing, in investment, in innovation, all of which we're doing as much as we can as long as we do it well. so it's going to come down to if we think we have investment opportunities that we can execute well that have an appropriate return we would like to keep doing that and in order to have the right to do it we would like to become more and more efficient in our core business operation. so we have not actually given guidance. i think i would characterize it as expenses under control creating capacity to invest. but we will decision investments based upon their merits and, obviously, explain them to you in the future at investor day, if not another venue.
16;8;296;1;0.0033783783783783786;so, first of all, i would say that based upon the speech and, obviously, you know that there are still some unanswered questions with respect to specific parts of the proposal which i will come back to, but based upon the speech moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy. and using the capital stack add-up using, our g-sib score and our stress drawdown actually you would come out with a capital constraint under ccar that's pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum. so in that sense because of the offset, because of the lack of balance sheet growth, lack of rwa growth and the curtailment of capital distributions, we've actually ended up in a place where we look to be approximately equally bound based on last year's test by both of those two measures, which is a space we've played in for a while. we've been, as we talked about before, we've been bound by many constraints, somewhat equally over a period of time and striving to operate within that constraint and maximize shareholder value. i think the things we do not know are, obviously, how funding or liquidity shock will be incorporated. and in any case this is not for the 2017 ccar cycle, so it's a whole cycle away from now. so we will be operating in 2017 under the same basic test construct as we have previously. and so i do not think it's a clear and present danger necessarily that we will be able to look at payout ratios that are above the top end of our range. meanwhile, we are at the top end of our range now.
16;9;184;2;0.010869565217391304;yes, so i would just generally speaking with respect to our rate sensitivity, as i think you know we are most sensitive to the front end of the curve but to ioer and prime. so we do have libor-based assets but also liabilities. a good example would be commercial loans on the asset side or long-term debt on the liability side. but our notional mismatch is not particularly big. and so as a consequence, the impact of libor curve moves has been not very significant on our p&l, we would not expect it to be. i will say that the libor moves were one of the features that our rates business had a perspective around. and they got good client flow in and around that trade. and so it was one of the catalysts, one of many, but one of the catalysts that we point to in terms of the ability for rates to monetize flow as we had a lot of client flow around that conviction. but i would not be able to put a number on it for you.
16;10;77;3;0.03896103896103896;i think we, obviously, did get some good inflows, liquidity flows in terms of money market reform into our government fund. but we also have been very focused in our other wholesale businesses on continuing to attract operating deposits. and so as i look at our overall strong deposit growth i would not say it was equally but it was pretty much equally wholesale operating and retail deposit growth. so we feel good about both of those.
16;11;252;3;0.011904761904761904;i might just give for context remind you all, or maybe you recall, that for a number of years now, for a fairly long time we've been standing up at investor day and other venues saying that customer experience is the central tenet for how we think about engaging with all of our clients but certainly our retail clients in the branches. and we have been very, very focused on investing in customer experience broadly defined and have made great progress, i think, in doing that. and also we had talked about the fact that what we are looking for very, very clearly is deep customer relationships, engaged customers. we want to be primary bank. we want to gather deeper share of wallet. so balance is not necessarily products. and so, again, remember saying that cross-sell is an outcome, it's not an objective. and that certainly is a philosophy with which we have designed our compensation and performance structures for the branches. we review them regularly, at least annually to make sure that they continue to be aligned with our objectives and, again, objectives about the engaged relationship with customers, good customer experience in the right products, all the right reasons the right way. so as we think about those objectives and how we've designed our plan and as we look inwardly not just, obviously, because of the news now but also regularly in our bau capacity we feel like our plans are designed to incent those behaviors.
16;12;201;2;0.009950248756218905;so i would say, first of all, i would say we, i will tell you, we are on track with respect to the commitments daniel made to you to deliver over time the $2.8 billion of expense saves. while we are not finished yet we are substantially through that program. so it's moved from being a plan through execution to being in the later stages of execution. so we feel very good about that, which means that all other things equal that $19 billion is still a reasonable level of expense target. however, obviously we pay for performance. and so clearly if we have significant out-performance next year relative to our expectations at the time of setting those plans, there would be some variable cost associated with it. but for every dollar of out-performance the variable cost may not always be the same. so, obviously, it also depends upon the mix and payout ratios and all those sorts of things. but a large, large portion of it would be, it would be, obviously, as you know incredibly accretive because we would be leveraging all of our scale, so the only variable cost would really be comp, largely.
16;13;109;2;0.01834862385321101;so first of all based upon last year's results for us we are at the floor for the stress capital buffer. not to suggest, by the way, that we would not continue to want to properly understand and better understand how we can through time make sure that we are performing the best we can under stress within our risk appetite. but we are at that floor right now. so within those constraints what we are trying to do is be within our risk appetite, manage risk properly but also add shareholder value. we have to carry that capital anyway, so we would want to use it well.
16;14;213;2;0.009389671361502348;so for your purposes i'm going to talk about nii. we do not really manage to nim. but you can, obviously, back into it. so if we ended up in a situation right now where rates were flat throughout all of 2017 which for what it's worth i do not think is pretty much anyone's central expectation right now, but if we were rate flat you've seen us grow our core loans and our loan balances pretty strongly, pretty consistently across businesses. and while we may not be able to replicate our 15% core loan growth forever, certainly we can continue to grow our loans. so on that plus mix shift away from securities over time we should be able to deliver $1.5 billion of incremental nii next year rate flat. you know that if rates are -- if we are fortunate enough for the right reasons that we see a hike this year, at the end of this year and get the full benefit of that next year, it will be higher than that. and you've seen our earnings and risk disclosures, they've been pretty close to a $3 billion number on a 100 basis point move for a while, most of which is front end.
16;15;232;4;0.017241379310344827;so look, we are aware, obviously, of the riskier types of cre lending, the types of lending that attract scrutiny for reasonable reasons considering how they've performed in past cycles. we are also mindful of where we are in the cycle and take that into consideration in our underwriting. so we have and continue to avoid what i would characterize as the riskier segments and those segments that performed poorly in previous cycles. and we really stick to our knitting, if that's an american expression, in terms of continuing to do what we are good at within our risk appetite. and so if you think about our commercial real estate growth, commercial term lending is about three-quarters of our portfolio. and you know that we are very focused on smaller loan size, term b -- sorry, class b, class c properties with low vacancy rates. so rent stabilized, supply constrained markets, underwrite to low ltvs, good debt service coverage. we look at forward rates and current rents. and so we really have an expertise in a specific niche and we compete on speed and certainty of execution, not on credit and structure. so we feel pretty good about our exposures and even in our more traditional real estate banking space we have avoided the riskier segments with limited construction lending exposure, homebuilders minimal exposure. we are pretty disciplined about it.
16;16;57;0;0.0;so we are a primarily prime lender in auto. we are the number one prime lender. we actually have the lowest share in subprime among the national banks. so it is less than 5% of our origination. so i would not speak specifically to underwriting in the lower fico sectors, not where we play at this point.
16;17;60;0;0.0;so not that i would comment on except for we have recently decided to pull back on 84-month plus term loans on all fico bands, just as where we are in the cycle as we see the risks of that type of lending. so we continue to calibrate our underwriting. but i would not comment on seeing anything specifically.
16;18;69;4;0.057971014492753624;auto? we've built $25 million of reserves this quarter for auto and we expect to continue. we think the auto opportunity is still strong and we have a great franchise. we have great manufacturing partnerships that are growing strongly, too. so as we grow that portfolio i would expect us to continue to grow reserves modestly in 2017. however, we are expecting charge-offs to stay under control.
16;19;122;2;0.01639344262295082;yes, so you are right. and, obviously, even specifically for jpmorgan if you look at our stress results that [handicapped] by the fed over the course of the last three years has been reasonable volatility. and clearly it's not the case that we will expect it to be completely stable. i would not expect to see the same levels of volatility going forward as we've seen historically as the test has, as you know, over time occasionally included new not insignificant features. and while that may continue to be the case i would think that there would be a bit more stability. but we have not actually gone through and finalized our thinking about what the buffers would look like.
16;20;191;0;0.0;yes, before i talk about the prioritization of capital distributions i would just start by saying our capital management policies prior to this year's ccar and this year's resolution had us making those actions regardless of whether they were allowed to be reflected in a test. and, obviously, as part of the resolution planning we have revised our policies to include more granular triggers. so our policies do with some specificity run pretty granularly through time through a stress speak to the sorts of actions that we would be leaning into and taking, even if they do not get reflected in the test. with respect to the prioritization, look, the soft cap on dividends has been lifted. dividends are ultimately still a part of the baseline minimum standard, so there will be possibly some natural constraint there. it has not changed, at this point anyway, the board's determination or management's determination about the order of priority. we would like to continue to have the capacity to grow our dividend. and i think even though there may be some natural constraints i think it would be above 30.
16;21;134;3;0.022388059701492536;so we are very focused across the spectrum of our businesses on developing better digital capabilities to allow seamless engagement with customers and acquisition through digital channels. there are complexities associated with documentation and standards for know your customer and anti-money laundering that we're continuing to work through. but ultimately it should be achievable, and we are working on it. so one of the things that we have previously mentioned is that the majority of our consumer accounts are opened in branches. one of the reasons among others why branches are [still] important to us as well as advice centers. and we will continue to work on trying to see how far and how fast we can move people to be able to have a better digital experience opening accounts with us.
16;22;119;3;0.025210084033613446;well, i will just start by pointing out that all of the businesses, all of our businesses, not just the ones that i talked about at the high level, not just macro spreads equities, but even if you go a level below that quite granular, all of our businesses did really quite well this quarter. so not to overuse the phrase firing on all cylinders but it really was pretty consistent. and normally you might see pockets of more strength and less strength. so i think it would be hard to imagine replicating this kind of strength through time consistently. but the fourth quarter is seasonally low and we have no reason to expect that it would not be.
16;23;156;0;0.0;so there is not a whole lot of really clear new news. so as we think about all of the -- frtb we've talked about before, modest and manageable, nothing about that has changed for us. but, obviously, there's the advanced and standardized credit operational proposals out there. the most important thing that we've yet to really, and there are pluses and minuses in it and different for us than others maybe. but the one thing that we have not really heard about yet, betsy, is how it will all be calibrated and calibration will be very important. so we are expecting to hear over the course of the next short while, and maybe that will be delayed some just given some of the discussion. and we will update you when we hear a bit more about how it's all going to come together. but right now it's still a little unclear.
17;1;211;1;0.004739336492890996;yes. so hey, ken, you guys have a busy day today. so i would say that, the first quarter is always a quarter in which we have a bunch of different factors. and most notably, you also have day count issues in the first quarter. so i can go through that, but i would say most of the benefit which we expect to be up modestly will be driven by the rate increase, with growth being offset by day count. that's sort of fundamentally how to think about it. it's probably more instructive to think about the full year. and so, if you recall back to the third quarter, just to kind of reorient everyone, at that point when we did not have the december hike, we said rates flat. so on growth alone, we would expect nii for the full year to be up about $1.5 billion. obviously, we have had the 25 basis point hike in december. and based upon that alone, so now the new rate flat, that $1.5 billion would be about $3 billion, a little over $3 billon. so for the full year, we're expecting on the december hike alone, that it would be about half volume, and about half rate.
17;2;173;0;0.0;yes. so i think the way to think about it, and again, i think we talked a little bit about it last quarter, and you maybe see it in the fourth quarter. so we've been growing our loans in the -- we said it was going to be a 10% to15%. we revised that, to be at the top end of that range. so we've been growing at around 15% core loan growth, the fourth quarter was 12%. so i would not call it a deceleration per se, but it is a little bit lower. so i think going into 2017, our expectation is that we would continue to grow loans strongly, but possibly at the lower end of that range, rather than the higher. and of course, to a degree, it will depend upon our mortgage portfolio, but we intend to continue to add to that too. so sitting here today, i'd say more high single 10% plus or minus, and we'll give you more updates at investor day.
17;3;0;0;NA; .
17;4;116;1;0.008620689655172414;so just taking the two things separately, betsy, i would say the nii, up 5% is dropping to the bottom line. but as we, you saw all of our underlying drivers, across all of the businesses and volumes, transactions, everything is growing very strongly. and although we still have some work to do to finish the large expense programs, we're near the end of that. so just generally speaking, we're continuing to invest in the businesses, and we'll see the improvement in our expenses flatten out, and start to grow with volumes. and that would also support growth in non-interest revenue, outside obviously of the card phenomenon we talked to you about.
17;5;148;0;0.0;sorry, carry on. right. so when we think about our investment securities portfolio, we think about it as responding to structural changes in our balance sheet, which predominantly is driven by loans and deposits. and it's always important i think, to remember, because we focus a lot on structural interest rate risk, but it also is liquidity and liquidity risk. in this quarter, there was a combination of things. you saw that we grew deposits more strongly than loans this quarter, so we had some excess cash, as well as the fact that rates rose. so two things happened in our investment securities portfolio, mortgages extended, and we did add to duration. but we have a very disciplined risk management framework that's based -- that's been consistent through time, based on our expectations of normal rates in the future, and we just executed on that strategy.
17;6;10;0;0.0;yes, we added to duration, in accordance with our framework.
17;7;269;7;0.026022304832713755;great. so obviously, the sapphire reserve card is still quite young, or still quite new. but relative to our modeled expectations even at the intro promo premium, things are coming in, in line or better than our expectations. now obviously, we need to continue to [back test] that [three] times. but we're very encouraged by, not only the excitement in our customer base, but also the way that the trends are performing in terms of spend and engagement. but when we introduce a new product, we intentionally introduce a very exciting premium promo, and it's intended to generate excitement. and i think you would agree it did. so we're delighted with the response that we've had. and we've actually kept it up for longer than we initially expected, but it's normal for us to come down from those intro rates, as the product becomes more mature, and that's what we are doing. but to be very clear about our expectations of the performance of the card, even at 100,000 points, we still expected the card to be a strong return and very accretive. so obviously, at a lower premium, it would be more so. but one last thing i would say, is everybody gets very interested the up front points. it's our opinion that the real value to consumers of that card happens over time with their spend behavior, and to take the points down from 100,000 to 50,000 has less than a 10% reduction in the overall value through the lifetime of an engaged customer on average.
17;8;68;0;0.0;so the charge-offs came in for the year at 2.63%, which is in line with the guidance that we gave, i think in november that kevin watters gave. he's given guidance for 2017, as we continue to see the newer vintages seasoned, are 2.75% plus or minus. and that's still our expectation, so the newer vintages are performing in line with our expectations.
17;9;290;4;0.013793103448275862;yes. so i'll give you a couple of things, and hopefully that will help. so i think a year or so ago, we talked about the fact that -- i'm going to now talk about cost of controls more broadly than just regulatory, that the cost of controls had increased for the company by about $3 billion over several years. but that we expected they would peak and start bending down, and that is indeed what we have been seeing. now i'm not saying that bend down is a sharp bend, as we continue to be held to very sort of hard compliance burdens. but nevertheless, we are seeing some efficiencies as we mature our processes and automate them. offsetting against that, and one of the reasons why it may be less obvious, is that we've continued to increase our spend in cyber security, as we want to protect the bank and the customer's data. so naturally, that is happening. we are not going to continue at this point, carving out the costs of regulatory or control because that is our operating model, it's our new normal. and until we understand whether or not the forward-looking landscape is changed, we will not be able to give you any kind of idea about how and when that will impact our expenses. but we will continue to be more and more efficient. and certainly, if we are able to take a step back, and look at the rules and regulations, and the way that they are being implemented, and make rational changes to it, if that is something that is -- allows us to become more efficient, then we will certainly do that, and keep you informed.
17;10;77;0;0.0;so i think in the conference in november, kevin watters said that as we look at the new products, and we look at them growing, coming out in 2016 and into 2017, we would expect the card revenue rate for the year next year to be about 10.5%, after which as the cards and the accounts season and drive revenue growth, we should see that continue to trend back up to a level in the past.
17;11;1;0;0.0;yes.
17;12;1;0;0.0;yes.
17;13;107;3;0.028037383177570093;i mean, i think that it's actual detail of retail spend, auto sales, house prices, household formation, confidence numbers. so i'm not basing it on the market, i'm just basing it -- if you look at a broad range of things, it looks like growth may have gotten a little bit better in the fourth quarter. plus if you take a walk around the world, japan is doing a little better, europe is doing better. in fact, one of the imf [or someone else] came out yesterday, and [said] the global growth is going to tick up next year. so it's just those factors.
17;14;92;0;0.0;we're not going to change our plans very much, because we do not really react that much to the weather, because we grow to add bankers and stuff. you know you have to do it through a cycle. i do think of it as some regulatory relief. you will see banks be more aggressive and growing, opening branches in new cities, adding to loan portfolios, seeking out clients they do not have. so i'm hoping to see a little bit of that too, but that will wait for regulatory relief.
17;15;275;3;0.01090909090909091;well, i'm saying we do not react to the small change in the economy to how we grow and expand our business. but i just that it looks to us, if you look across the broad spectrum, capital expenditures, business confidence, consumer confidence, household building, household formation, wage income, wages going up, unemployment going down, auto sales going up, retail sales going up, it looks like it's getting stronger, not weaker. that's what it looks like to me. that's just my own personal belief. and maybe just if we give you a bit of insight into the philosophy about how we do our investment and expense budgeting. when we talk to our businesses, regardless to jamie's point about necessarily whether the external factors are moving, the question is, what do we want to do in terms of products and services and technology and bankers and offices that we can execute on well and responsibly? and that is typically what defines us, not our appetite to invest the dollars. so i think we've told you pretty consistently that, and you've seen it. we added 130 net new bankers, we opened eight offices in the commercial bank. we're investing in technology very, very broadly, payments, digital across the company. so i would say that, we do not feel like we've been held back in terms of our appetite to invest, because of concern around the economy. and in the same way, a more confident outlook in the economy will not step change that. but we will continue to look for great investments everywhere we can and make them.
17;16;247;5;0.020242914979757085;so i would say, just if we separate the two, and just talk for one second about banking. the fundamentals for a solid m&a year are there, and obviously there will be puts and takes depending on what happens in the policy and reforms space. but we're optimistic about a solid m&a market, but with the continuing trend of fewer mega deals, but nevertheless good flow. at ecm, looks set to be quite active, and the ipo market continuing to recover, and debt capital markets have a solid pipeline in terms of the refinance arena, but having said that, interest rates may have an impact. so i think pretty solid pipeline coming into the year, but lots of factors will ultimately affect the full year. with respect to trading, jamie said, that we do not look at the first couple of weeks, but so far, so good. and what i would tell you is, we said this before, we're a client flow oriented business. and there will be a lot of micro and event-driven activity, and as long as it's not discontinuous, we should be able to intermediate transactions with our clients. and so far, generally there's been more risk appetite in the investor space, but that can change very quickly as we saw in previous quarters. so we will be there to support our clients. and if they are active, everything should be good, but it can change quickly.
17;17;241;4;0.016597510373443983;so just reminding you about our sort of philosophy on comp to revenue, we pay -- or our comp to revenue is just a calculation, obviously we pay for shareholder value-added. so you need to take into consideration the fact that we've had overtime increased capital levels and liquidity levels, and that's reflected in a declining overall comp to revenue ratio. i would say that there are three factors to it being lower. the first is the strength in performance, and the pay outs are not linear. and as you have stronger performance, you would expect to see a lower ultimate outcome. but importantly, we were -- some tail winds in the numbers this year included a stronger dollar. so as we pay -- remember comp to revenue is not just on the front office compensation, it all supports our salaries, benefits and compensation. and we have a large number of people that we pay not in dollars. so that was a bit of a tail wind. some of that will carry on, but maybe not at the same level. and we also just did our normal regular hygiene and productivity, in terms of the -- how we think about the workforce and pay. at the end of the day, we pay for performance, we pay, we think very competitively, to retain the best team on the street, and make sure that our shareholders are getting a fair share of any outperformance.
17;18;196;3;0.015306122448979591;simplifying the securitization rules, because we've done some securitizations. we think they're excellent, but that would open up the market a little bit, clarifying the safe harbors on certain types of underwriting. for example, it's very hard and risky for a bank to make a loan to first time buyers, former bankruptcies, even though it could be very good people with brand new jobs, self-employed, it's hard to necessarily do all of the income verification, stuff like that. simplifying servicing, the services standards now have, i think nationwide, we have 3,000 different standards. it's very costly. it's very expensive. it's kind of risky. if you make a mistake, the punishment is pretty high. and all those things, that should be done for the good of the united states of america, not for the good of jpmorgan chase. and so, i do think it's too tight and there's one thing, that if you get around too quickly, it will help the housing market a little bit, it will help the housing formation, it will reduce the cost of mortgages, and make it available to more people.
17;19;2;0;0.0;hi, glenn.
17;20;407;10;0.02457002457002457;so starting off with sort of interest rates. and obviously, we've talked for an extended period of time about the fact we've positioned the company to benefit when rates rise, we built the branches, we acquired the accounts, we've built the technology and the services. so we've been growing our deposits very strongly, and we're going to enjoy the benefits of that. with respect to how much will go to the bottom line, we have been we think appropriately conservative, when we've given you guidance about ultimately how much incremental nii we would expect in a more normal rate environment. i mean, if you go back to investor days of past, you would see that we said when normalized, we would expect $10 billion-plus, and embedded in that are assumptions obviously around rate paid. we think that rate paid will be higher this time in this cycle, than in previous cycles for a bunch of reasons including as you said, competition for high quality liquidity balances. but also that we are coming off of zero rates and the improvement in technology. so we've been, we think appropriately conservative, but we'll find out in the fullness of time. so far two rate hikes, absolute rates at 50 basis points, it's too early. and so far, you would expect there to be (inaudible) in there, and it's not linear, and everything is behaving quite rationally right now. so we, in fact, if anything a little better than we had modeled. so we'll keep watching it, and we think we've been thoughtful. we do not know the right answer, and we'll keep you updated as we see how things progress. and just on the tax side, so other people understand, generally, yes, if you reduce the tax rates all things being equal to 20% of something, eventually that increased return will be competed away. that is a good thing. okay, so it's not a good thing for jpmorgan chase per se, but it's a good thing for the world, it's a good thing for growth. and a lot of studies actually show the beneficiary of that is wages. and so, it's important for people to understand that good tax policy is good for growth and the country in general. it's not just good for companies, it will eventually be competed away.
17;21;46;2;0.043478260869565216;listen, you are not going to really know for probably nine months to a year exactly what it is, so i would not worry too much about it. and i also, just remember the most efficient companies do benefit from things like this, more than others.
17;22;252;5;0.01984126984126984;i think if you look at -- i mean, again, there's a lot of wood to be chopped and sausage to be made before tax reform gets done. and some of these things are brand new, they've never been talked about or done before, so you can read a lot of studies in the next six months. obviously, interest deductibility, for banks, from a net interest income, so it does not directly change how you look at it. for everybody else, it affects complete industries differently. how you leverage differently, and utilities will be in a different position, and unleveraged companies. and plus, i think people will be able to convert what would have been interest expense to some other kind of expense. so let the work get done, before we spend too much time guessing about it. i also think that while interest deductibility is one point, the repatriation of cash is another point. and there are puts and takes, and you have to think, you have to see the whole package, before you can see what the net impact is. but ultimately if these things get done rationally and grow the economy, then it's good for our franchise just broadly. so do not focus on dcm, focus on the whole thing. and i think when you get the whole package, if it's done well which we hope will happen, then it will be good for the economy, good for our clients, and good for our whole franchise.
17;23;171;1;0.005847953216374269;yes, okay. so yes, matt, it does include the benefit of higher long end rates. and if you get the q, and get our disclosure on net income risk, and do some math, you'll get pretty close to numbers that looks similar to that $1.5 billion or more. and then, with respect to rate sensitivity from here, clearly it's not linear. so you can see, if we just look at the third quarter, the first 100 basis points -- this is an illustration of $2.8 billion, 200 basis points is $4.5 billion. so as we clip away, 25 basis points a time, our $2.8 billion will start to come down. and so, that's broadly the outlook. and the next 10-q will show the next -- (multiple speakers). and the next 10-q will show the next. but obviously, it's less and less as rates go up. it's not linear. unless we actively change the ratio, which we may also do at one point.
17;24;91;0;0.0;yes. so i mean, what you saw happen in 2016 was not only obviously a rotation from securities and deploying deposits into loans, but also we took a very large amount of non-operating deposits out of the balance sheet in 2016. so that is having an impact. but we would expect to continue to grow our loans, to grow our deposits strongly to manage the overall balance sheet through our investment securities portfolio. and from here, if everything continues to be as the market implies, we should see margin expansion.
17;25;0;0;NA; .
17;26;226;2;0.008849557522123894;yes. so answer is across the metals and mining and energy, we have a little over $1.5 billion of reserves. i mean, there is a normal level of reserves that we will have, that would be a large chunk of that. and as you saw in 2016, we did take charge-offs of a little less than $300 million. so we will continue to likely see on a name specific basis, as people work through their business models, that there will be more charge-offs. but ultimately, if energy stays stable or improves, and of course, we have to see that be somewhat sustained, and find its way flowing through the financial statements of our clients. then as we upgrade them, god willing, then we will see more reserve releases. but it's going to take some time. we'll start to see some of that -- and think about the large reserves we took. we took them at the tail end of 2015 and into 2016, we'll start to see new financial data from our clients. we'll start to do the borrowing base redeterminations, and look at the impact of prices on reserves in the spring. and so, we'll start getting some data this year, and so we may see some more releases, but it's going to come through over time.
17;27;108;5;0.046296296296296294;yes, i mean, i would say that when i talk about the overall core loan growth going down, still being strong, it does reflect the fact that we've been seeing very strong outperformance in our growth over the course of the last couple of years, particularly in commercial term lending. and while we continue to believe there's great opportunities there, they will be lower. so we've been printing in the teens pretty consistently, and i would say, it will be less red hot, and maybe more in the high single-digits, but we're going to keep you updated. there's still plenty of opportunity.
17;28;135;4;0.02962962962962963;well, i do not know that i would ever try to decide what moment in time, is the pinnacle. but i would say, you saw us invest heavily in the business in 2015 and 2016 across a number of different fronts. you saw us proactively renegotiating the card program deals for the vast majority of our portfolio, and investing very heavily in exciting new products. and in both cases, while it has had an impact on our revenues, in one case in the short-term, and another case more structurally, in both cases these are still very attractive returns. and so, card is still a very attractive roe business, very important to our customers. we are after deep engaged relationships through time with them. and so, we are going to continue to invest in growth.
17;29;4;0;0.0;at this point, yes.
17;30;235;1;0.00425531914893617;we did try to actually analyze it, because we got asked a lot about what was secular. so you could break apart your exotic derivatives, certain types of cdos. of course, across the whole spectrum, there are things that disappeared and will not be done no more, for better or worse. in some cases, by the way, like a cdos it did not go away, because the person is still a credit buyer. so they just went to another product, but that was our best estimate. i do not want to over do it or anything like that. i also said that the actual market making requirements are going to be going up over time, i'm talking about over 20 years, i'm not talking about the next quarter or next month. and remember, we do not run the business next quarter, next month, because assets under management are going up, and needs of corporations are going up. the fixed income mortgage is going to go up, the needs for fx is going up, the needs for hedging is going up. so over time, we know there's going to be a cyclical increase. and we just try to estimate how much of the [downturn] is cyclical, and so, there will be a flip side of that. and i think you might have gotten to the end of the secular, end of cyclical decline.
17;31;172;2;0.011627906976744186;so i will obviously, give you a lot more detail about all of this at investor day, but really quick, because i knew the $19 billion would get some excitement. if you go back, and talk to yourself to look at the specifics on the slide, you should see that the $19 billion that he guided to did have some assumptions about some legal costs in there. the cib did not have legal costs in the year. and as a result, it's still a little higher on an apples-to-apples basis than that would imply. additionally, i talked about the tail winds in terms of a stronger dollar. now for full disclosure we have intentionally reinvested some of that, but it was a tail wind that meant that apples-to-apples, it would still be a little higher. i'd tell you that compared to the targets that they set, we still have a few hundred million dollars to deliver on, and daniel will go through that at investor day.
17;32;251;9;0.035856573705179286;okay, so just to talk about rate trading for a second. you're right, that it was a part of the strength story in the fourth quarter this year. it was also a strong fourth quarter last year, which is pretty much the only reason why we did not call it out as a bigger driver of the year-over-year growth, but it was a strong performance in the quarter. and we would expect that to continue. it's much more interesting to -- for our clients to trade around a moving yield curve and rates above zero. so as we see rates normalize, we would fully expect that to be ultimately a beneficiary to the franchise in terms of clients trading, and positioning, and hedging around that over time. and so, [wonderful] if that would be the case. in terms of the excitement and the enthusiasm of our businesses, lending versus we're enthusiastic about all of our businesses, and would want to defend share and grow them all. i mean, the reality of the cib revenue performance in markets, and in general, it was very strong in 2016. so we will try our hardest to replicate that. but it will be a challenging comparison, but we're proud of it. so we gained share competitively over the course of the last couple years, and so i do not think you should necessarily expect that we can continue to gain share at that pace SEMICOLON but defend it we will.
17;33;206;3;0.014563106796116505;i think the better way to look at cib lending, is it's kind of episodic, and goes in and out. corporations, a lot of corporations do not need to borrow, and when they do, it may be inconsistent. it might be because of m&a or something like that. our [bridge] book will always be driven by certain types of activity, so the loan book is not something -- the cib loan book is not something you're going to say, that you're growing. that is more serving clients in the way they need. one of the things i just want to point out which is, of course, all of our businesses, but just take trading in particular is, we're always creating efficiencies. part of what we're investing is big data, is [trade] through processing, electronic exchanges, online services. i think 97% of fx -- i think it's 50% to 60% of us interest rate swaps, all these things have become electronic and digitized, as trade through for clients. so that's where some of the investments are going. and you're going to see more of that not less, but it also creates another round of efficiencies every time we do that.
17;34;3;0;0.0; . how are you?
17;35;131;0;0.0;yes, so we talked before about -- we had in certain markets already pulled back, not necessarily because we had a crystal ball, but because we saw them getting soft before the energy decline. dallas and houston would be examples, parts of brooklyn would be examples of that. i would say, watching more carefully -- you've seen us, we have that there is some supply coming through in markets, seattle, denver, d.c., san francisco. we're still very active there, but just keeping an eye on those markets. but the supply pipeline, while it's real does not look like it did when we saw the real pressure on the term lending business, the real estate business back in the 1980s and 1990s. so we're keeping an eye on it.
17;36;151;4;0.026490066225165563;(inaudible) i'll add, we do not want to give you all of our secrets in that business, but we do (inaudible). but we're very disciplined about where we see supply, and supply and demand and pricing, and we would have no problem, not growing at all. we do not sit at meetings here and say, can you grow at 10%, can you grow to [12%]? no, if we can not meet what we think is proper risk return, we're not going to grow at all. we'll shrink. we have no problem doing that. and so, the other thing i want to point out about ctls, the exceptional performance of the ctls through the last great recession. i mean, we were really pleased with how that happened. so we try to look at all these things through the cycle, not just what are they doing in good times.
17;37;7;0;0.0;we do not disclose that. thank you.
17;38;157;2;0.012738853503184714;so, there's a couple different things. first of all, we, about a little more than half of our originations are jumbo. we retain all of those. and then, when you look at the conforming space, it's really, honestly, consistently the best execution decision. and so in particularly in this quarter, it speaks a bit more to our correspondent conforming volume, it's the lowest margin product. and it does somewhat frequently toggle backwards and forwards in terms of better execution, whether we would retain or sell it. but we intend to keep adding to our portfolio, we like the mortgage asset classes. even those spreads have compressed in the fourth quarter, oas and roes are holding up. and so, i would expect us to continue to grow it strongly. and from quarter to quarter, it may go up or down a few percent, but over a year, we'll continue to add to the portfolio.
17;39;1;0;0.0;no.
17;40;42;0;0.0;i think there was a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, particularly around actively managed product. i think you're accurate. but we have not seen everybody else yet, but i think you will be true, when we see everybody.
17;41;18;0;0.0;that's a really hard question to answer. i'd have to think about that a little bit.
17;42;107;2;0.018691588785046728;i think that -- i mean, everything is going to end up being reasonably named specific, so i mean, that may be true in some cases. but for some companies in industries, where deregulation and that would be more helpful. but generally as i said the trend is towards lower -- i'm sorry, less mega deals, more flow, and the fundamentals are in pretty good shape, and then there will possibly be tail winds, in terms of tax reform and other things. so i think net-net, we think the underlying flow in the m&a market, and the fundamentals are set to have a pretty positive year.
17;43;7;0;0.0;we'll see. no more questions, operator?
18;1;121;0;0.0;so in the retail space, the answer is no, not really. and to be completely honest, we've been pretty consistent that we would not really have expected there to be much in terms of deposit reprice at absolute levels of rates that are still quite low. and so with ioer at 100 basis points, we're still in that sort of realm of the atmosphere, and so we would expect that to start happening a couple of rate hikes from here maybe. we'll have to wait and see. we've obviously never really been through exactly this before. on the other side of the equation, in the wholesale space, we are in the process of seeing a reprice happen.
18;2;1;0;0.0;no.
18;3;229;1;0.004366812227074236;yes, so i do not have all those numbers directly in front of me. i know that in the commercial bank, our exposure to mortgage is really pretty modest, it's around about a total of $3 billion in the commercial real estate space. and i would tell you that while there obviously is a lot of discussion around retail, and with some merit, it's very case-by-case, location-by-location-specific. and i kind of liken the discussions a lot to discussions we have around our bricks-and-mortar banking businesses, which is consumer -- the way consumers engage with retail is not changing, it does not mean they will stop engaging with retailers. and so it will be very specific with respect to location and tenants. and it does not necessarily mean that retail is going to be in as much potential trouble as i think people are talking about. so we remain cautiously watching it but also cautiously optimistic that it's not -- that it's a bit overblown. and you should assume that we've looked at not just direct retail or retail-related real estate, and all the vendors to any potentially covered retailers. when you put it all together, it's a little bit like there'll be something there, but it's nothing that will be dramatic when it's happening.
18;4;15;0;0.0;are you talking about real estate related to retail? or are you talking about retailers?
18;5;111;0;0.0;no, you're way out of line. i mean, direct retail exposure, we're very careful. the retail business has always been violent and volatile. you can look back through our history, and half of them are gone after 10 years. that's the normal course. so we're usually senior, we're very careful with stuff like that. and then you go to real estate, okay, most of our real estate has nothing to do with retail. so we do have some shopping centers and malls and buildings and stuff like that. but those are generally high on the stack, well-secured and not relying on single retailers, et cetera.
18;6;16;0;0.0;it will be like oil and gas for us, it will not be a big deal.
18;7;284;1;0.0035211267605633804;yes. so look, i know that -- so one of the things that we want to remind everybody before we talk about the trend is that the credit card losses are still at absolutely very, very low levels. and notwithstanding whatever we would have done or have done or continue to do with our credit books, we would ultimately have expected them to normalize to higher rates regardless, so -- and then for -- obviously, the first quarter has not been that... it's probably just the previous cycle stuff. yes, exactly. and obviously, first quarter has some seasonality. so i would just start by saying that the charge-off rates we're seeing are completely in line with our expectations and guidance that we gave you at investor day both in terms of 2017 being below 3% and over the medium term being between 3% and 3.25% for all of the reasons we articulated. a combination of positive credit expansion that took place over the last couple of years and the performance of those newer vintages is in line with our expectations and with high risk-adjusted margins. so it's not really about tolerating the charge-offs as long as we're getting paid properly for the risk, which is the case. and obviously, as we see those charge-off rates both normalize and reflect those newer vintages, they will go up modestly over time. and we expanded our credit in a targeted way, but it was not a significant expansion. and we will respond in our credit and risk appetite to whatever we're seeing in the environment. but it will not necessarily be predicated by charge-offs rates as long as (inaudible).
18;8;102;2;0.0196078431372549;so i would say if you look back over 2016 and even 2015 and '16, it's true and clear that we gained share, not just in fixed income -- reasonable share not just in fixed income but also in equities. and our business performed well last year. and i would suggest to you that we will defend that share. but the competition is back and healthy. and you can not expect us to continue to gain share at those kinds of levels. we want to defend it, but it's a healthy competitive market right now. so i would say not really.
18;9;10;0;0.0;we have a ways to go before we're concerned.
18;10;150;3;0.02;for merchant processing, there's a lot of share you can gain. and that's not even close, because you give products and services and a change in technology. and i think we're way, way in credit card when you say, "well, that's too big for jpmorgan chase." there is a point where it's going to be a good question, but it's not even remotely close to this one. and i would also say that cards continue to be a very competitive space. so we will continue to try and provide our customers with significant value and have deep, engaged relationships. but i do not think you're going to see material shifts in share in the short term. and we also look strategically at credit card, debit card, online bill pay, p2p as all one big thing to do a great job for the client.
18;11;58;2;0.034482758620689655;not particularly at this point. i think we're very happy with the performance of the portfolios, with the growth rates we're getting. you saw that our core card loans were up 9% year-on-year. we're getting a lot of nii benefit from that. so i think we're pretty well positioned at this point.
18;12;15;0;0.0;yes, i would say loan growth should be in the mid- to higher single digits.
18;13;170;1;0.0058823529411764705;so obviously, when we give you guidance, we give you sort of reasonably rounded numbers. so actually, the impact of current implied is a bit more than $500 million more than it was at investor day. but in the law of big numbers, that's a pretty reasonable amount. yes, there is an element, of course, as we talked about, in the wholesale space, where we are seeing reprice happen, and it does reflect our estimates of what we expect to see over the course of the year in cumulative deposit bases. and with respect to if there was -- and you know that the implied has priced in 1.5 more hikes, so it's -- obviously, march is earlier, so longer, there's a little bit more rate benefit. but it's sort of in line with our expectations. and if we had another rate hike, it would likely be later in the year, and ultimately have a relatively modest impact on this year but obviously be important going forward.
18;14;11;1;0.09090909090909091;you should be able to extrapolate those numbers on your own.
18;15;383;4;0.010443864229765013;i think it's important to put that slowdown into context. i mean, we did have 8% growth year-on-year in c&i. we're just saying sequentially, things are a bit quieter, and there's a whole bunch of reasons that could be driving that. and importantly, you mentioned it, when we're in dialogue with our clients, they are optimistic and they are thinking about growing their businesses and hiring, and all of those things are true. and so putting aside those that have access to capital markets for a variety of reasons in newer bank loans, it's completely understandable that optimism would lead actions. and so as to what that lag will look like, we'll wait and see. but fundamentally, a pro-growth series of policies will be constructive to the economy, to our clients, and ultimately, will end up in them hiring, spending, and they already are, and we'll see that translate into loan growth. whether that's in the second half of this year, we'll see. i would just add that i would not overreact to the short term in the loan growth because there are so many things that affect it. when you go through the episodic part, if you look at cib, i would not look at loan growth at all, because companies have a choice of doing loans and deals and -- or bonds, something like that. look at credit card looks okay. mortgage is obviously affected by interest rates. autos is obviously affected by auto sales. and middle market was okay. it was like it was slow, but it was okay. so i would not overreact to that. and the second thing is you all should expect as a given that when you have a new president and they get going, that the 9 months after the 100 days is going to be a sausage-making period. there will be ups and downs, wins and loss, stuff like that, okay? but it is a pro-growth agenda, tax, infrastructure, regulatory reform. and that is a good thing, all things being equal. and we think that if that took place, it would be helpful to americans. but to not -- to expect it to be smooth sailing, that would just be silly.
18;16;145;1;0.006896551724137931;it looks fine. and of course, it's episodic. yes. and i would also say that while, of course, people's dialogues include a degree of discussion around regulatory reform and tax reform and the like, it is not stopping the strategic dialogue and it is not stopping people from -- or boards from considering strategic deals partly because of what you said, partly because there is a recognition that these things will take some time to ultimately get finalized, and that they do not want to put their strategic agenda on hold. so in some ways, you get both sides of the equation. people are not going to wait indefinitely to get certainty on issues when there are good strategic deals that can be done, and that's past the dialogue. so not to say it has no impact, but it's still quite healthy.
18;17;444;8;0.018018018018018018;can i just answer that? marianne has given you guys some very specific guidance on interest rates. when interest rates got to 0, remember that when it floored, those -- no one expected the first 25 to 50 basis point to necessarily be paid out, because of the cost. marianne also gave you at investor day a very forward-looking view of that, where it kind of normalizes, okay? and it's different for every different type of deposit. for wholesale deposits, commercial credit deposits, company deposits, treasury deposits. they're all different. so it's hard summarize it all. but at one point, you're going to go back to kind of a normalized spread, and in terms of just retail, i would say that's like 3%. maybe a little less than that. maybe a little less. and i would also just say, i am glad that you brought up one point because it's something that i'd like -- a point that i'd like to make, which is when people think about the benefit we get from nii on rising rates, there's an element of people making it sound very passive. yes, you're correct, we did build those branches, we acquired those customers, we built the product, we invested in the customer service to be able to enjoy the industry-leading deposit growth that we're having. but i would also make the -- and so as margins improve, then, we will obviously enjoy the benefit of that. and to your point, we invested to be able to. but i will say that if you -- we look at the performance of our branches every single week, month, individually, put together by market, and the very, very, very vast majority of them, meaning that only a handful do not, are profitable in their own right today at these spreads on a marginal basis. so the branches are doing very well. there's another number we give you all that you should look at. we give you what we expect normalized margins and normalized returns to be in consumer, card, all these businesses. those numbers include normalized credit card charge-offs, like the credit card, the number we now use is for in a quarter, something like that, and in retail, going back to normal spreads. that's what those numbers include. and of course, it all bounces around. but we kind of look at them to be priced for normalized results. we do not price for them to be overearning or underearning or to have too much credit or too little. and that's kind of how we run the business.
18;18;157;1;0.006369426751592357;we've built that into every number we've given you. we've always told you the beta and gamma. yes, i can point you to a presentation in may of 2014 where we showed exactly what we expected the complexity of deposit reprice to look like based upon historical moves. so what we have actually seen to date looks incredibly similar in terms of realized reprice. you're absolutely right. i will tell you though that history may not be a precise predictor of the future because we've never really been in this exact position before and other things play into the equation, including the fact that the industry, but us specifically, have significantly invested in other customer service products, items like digital and the like, which will change the dynamic one way or another on reprice. so you're right, historically, 100, 150 basis points should dot [ph] see some movement, we'll see.
18;19;105;1;0.009523809523809525;yes, but i'd be a little cautious there, too. i mean, we feel great about the deposit growth and the account growth. so you have new accounts that are growing and existing accounts are growing. remember, there you also -- history -- you've got to be very careful, because if rates were higher, people do different things with their money, like cds. and then how they view the stock market, that money -- some of that attracts lenders to the market. so we're always conscious of the fact those flows kind of ebb and flow, and history is only somewhat of a guide to that.
18;20;334;1;0.0029940119760479044;so i picked that category out precisely because it did not take legislation and it was very important. and my point is not about banks versus nonbanks. my point is about the united states of america and what these things did to the availability of credit to a certain class of people. i was very specific, and we actually published a research report in mortgage land, which you can go get, by mr. jozoff, that really breaks it out. but because of the cost of servicing delinquent accounts, $2,000 a year, because of the additional cost of origination, because of the potential litigation, because of the not clarity around the qm, because of the forward claims that the consumer's both paying more and the credit box is wider than it would otherwise be. and that we actually believe that credit box is hurting first-time buyers, younger, self-employed, prior defaults, someone who when they defaulted passed his reserve, who always say deserves a second chance. so that policy has restricted that. and the shocking thing to me is the absolute size of that, which we think could be $300 billion to $500 billion a year. that one thing alone could have added -- because of a secular stagnation, could have added 0.3% or 0.4% a year to growth. so if you'd changed it 5 years ago, you're talking about a lot of growth, a lot of jobs, a lot of new homes, a lot of young families into homes and a very positive thing without taking a lot of extra credit risk. it's not -- it was about america, is why i wrote it. i could care less whether the banks and nonbanks do it. my point about that was how it's hurting the growth of america and hurting that class of citizens. and i really think some of you should be writing about that more because that's how important it is. that was one example.
18;21;260;3;0.011538461538461539;okay. so i would just start by saying we've been consistent that our operating model, including the diversification of our businesses, has been and was a source of strength not just for us but also for the financial markets during the crisis. and there is strength in the way the company operates that can not be discounted. i would also say that the commentary feels unnecessary given where the industry stands on capital liquidity and regulatory reform broadly. and i would just point, as i'm sure you all read, to most recently, governor tarullo making comments about this but historically, other thought leaders in the financial stability space talking about it. and i would further say that it does not feel, for the reasons that you just articulated in terms of structural reform or structural change in the model of banks, that, that would be consistent with a level playing field and pro-growth agenda in the u.s. so that's kind of how we feel about it. i can not give you specific reasons to not continue to monitor the situation. but it does not feel consistent with the rest of the objectives of the administration. and with respect to investor day a couple of years ago, lots of things have fundamentally changed since then, but the ultimate conclusion has not, which is that we believe that there's significantly more value for our shareholders, and as i said before, for the economy with this company the way it is today than in some other form.
18;22;189;1;0.005291005291005291;first of all, we do not overthink the shape of the curve or the process of normalization in any one period. we think about the reason for the actions. and ultimately, as long as they're kind of growing, you'll see both of the short and the long end of rates ultimately go up. and even though i know that it's lower than what we've broken down, broken below a little bit of the lower bounds, it's been in the kind of 2.30%, 2.60% range for a while, so we're still within -- largely speaking, within the range. and our central case is that we're going to see the 10-year higher by the end of the year. and if you look at our earnings and risk disclosures, we're much more sensitive to -- as a pure nii, nim matter, to the front end of rates. and so not to say it would not have an impact, but it would take a while for that to have an impact that would meaningfully offset any of the benefit of higher short-end rates.
18;23;114;5;0.043859649122807015;well, i mean, ultimately, sort of any actions by central banks, any change in the shape of the yield curve, anything that is presenting an opportunity for clients to transact and trade is an opportunity for our businesses. so as long as it happens in a reasonably rational fashion and there are no significant events, it should create an opportunity for clients and an opportunity therefore for us. always keep in mind that why they do something probably is more important than the what they do. so if they are doing it because the american economy is getting stronger, that is more important than the direct effect of adding -- letting securities mature, et cetera.
18;24;11;0;0.0;it could, i just would not put that in your models.
18;25;44;0;0.0;so well, i mean -- so in terms of rates, obviously, the loan balances are seasonally low in the first quarter and charge-off rates are higher in the first quarter. but overall, we're not expecting to see abnormal patterns in our charge-offs.
18;26;83;0;0.0;because it happens every 5 to 10 years, so why would anyone be surprised? and we've always been very conscious of this and very careful about how we do leases, we do them conservatively, we've got... but we only do them to our strategic manufacturing businesses. and only to strategic manufacturers, and we properly account for it. and we have loss mitigation. that's pretty important. so no, we're not surprised, it's going to happen every now and then.
18;27;4;0;0.0;i have no idea.
18;28;232;3;0.01293103448275862;so it's actually got somewhat less to do with our marketing strategy than it has to do with the fantastic success we've had with the new products, particularly sapphire reserve, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year. but fundamentally, if you go back, i think, to a conference that kevin watters spoke at last year sometime in, i think, september, he said, look, we're going to see the revenue rate be lower about 10% and some for the couple of quarters while we acquire all of these accounts. once we've hit a pace, we should see it middle out at 10.5% the full year of 2017, so the first quarter lower and subsequent quarters continuing to now start rising back up towards the 11.25%, which was our ultimate run rate target. and that's still fundamentally what we're expecting to see, which is we're at a -- assuming that our expectations of what we're going to see in account growth over the future period continues to hold, we would expect to see an increase from here in the second quarter, the overall year, to be sort of finish the mid-10s and the year 11-ish, and then go back to 11.25% over the course of the next couple of years. (inaudible) and we have great new products.
18;29;9;0;0.0;i said i'm not interested. i'm kidding.
18;30;80;1;0.0125;look, i've been clear. i think that gary cohn and steve mnuchin are doing the right thing. they want to find the right people for those jobs. they're talking about -- i gather they're talking to lots of people. but even after they announce it, remember, they need to be vetted and confirmed, and that's -- that normally could take 90 days. well, the sooner, the better, but i think getting the right people is as equally important.
19;1;529;1;0.001890359168241966;yes. i would just stop for a second to just point out that what jamie actually said was, "this is uncharted territory. it's not something that we've seen before." and so while it is the case that the fed is communicating clearly and has every intention to make this gradual and predictable, things can change, and we should just be prepared for that. not to say that, that would have a particularly significant impact necessarily on jpmorgan but that, that would just be a downside risk, not a probability. so on the balance sheet, it's still the case that we expect to start seeing normalization in the balance sheet in september SEMICOLON if not in september, by the end of this year. and we're still actually calling for the next rate hike in december SEMICOLON the market is calling for march of next year. and as we said, the communication has been pretty consistent and pretty clear across the fed space, which is to say that it's mostly priced into the market at this point as far as we can tell. and so based upon what we've understood, all things equal, we would see the balance sheet shrink about $1.5 trillion over about the next 4 years. so that would ultimately slow growth, not stop growth. and if we saw $1 billion -- sorry, $1.5 trillion come out of the fed's balance sheet, empirical evidence would suggest that we do not see dollar-for-dollar reduction in deposits. so if you just pick a point between $500 billion and $1 trillion of deposit outflows, at our 10% market share, that would be about $75 billion over 4 years. so it would slow growth. it would not stop growth. and it is what we've been expecting and what we've been talking about now for an extended period, and gradual is good in that sense. in respect of which deposits we would like to see, so that's the sort of growth scenario. in terms of liquidity, again, evidence would suggest, and we've been communicating this quite clearly, that we think the preponderance of that deposit outflow would be wholesale deposits and that would -- it would be nonoperating deposits. and those are deposits we ascribe little to no liquidity value to. so assuming that we're close to right, we would see those deposits ultimately leave the system, but it would not affect materially, if at all, our liquidity position. so ultimately, the yield curve has priced, i think, all of this in. what i think the fed had been clear about is that they expect the balance sheet or hope the balance sheet to be in the background and to use short rates as their primary monetary policy tool. and so as a result, we would ultimately expect to see perhaps a flattening yield curve, but with the front end ultimately pulling the long end up. and you heard yellen -- chair yellen talk about being conscious of the shape of the curve as they go about normalization. i think you may have asked something else. did i miss anything?
19;2;266;1;0.0037593984962406013;no, we -- that's correct. if you saw the -- compared to a $400 million expectation, we were up $150 million. so it would be fair to say that most of it was in this quarter. we had also -- when we gave the last set of guidance at $4.5 billion, we pointed out that the 10-year was low and that, that was ultimately pressuring that $4.5 billion. so it really is not that significant of a change. the only thing i would caution you to remember is that when we think about asset sensitivity and we think about nii, market nii, which we would not consider to be, in a traditional sense, core, can exhibit volatility geographically with nir. if you think about a market-making business where we can have assets that are throwing off nii hedged by derivatives that ultimately have an offset in nir, we actually think about that in total revenue numbers. so there could be a little noise in there, but no, i'm not expecting there to be significant changes. but i think what this makes me realize acutely is that no good deed ever goes unpunished. and chasing our tails, reforecasting the full year nii every 3 quarters is not as important -- or every quarter is not as important as keeping our eye on the long term, which is nothing has changed. we are absolutely realizing the benefits we expected in the banking book assets and liabilities, and that means that our long-term projections will be good and the path is a little bit less important.
19;3;123;1;0.008130081300813009;yes. so i understand why you're asking. as you look at the loan yields, they look relatively flat or even slightly down. if you adjust for the mortgage, it would be flat. if you decompose them into wholesale versus retail, we are absolutely seeing all of the yield improvement on the wholesale side, about 10-ish basis points. and on the consumer side, at this -- with respect to this quarter, there were some mix impacts in the card business as we saw a higher level of transactors and saw a few other things. so it's not to say that the loan yields are not moving in line with our expectations, and they are, but mix will matter for any one quarter.
19;4;30;0;0.0;yes, that's right. and if you look back last quarter, they did, too. it's just that we've had a couple of opposing things going on this quarter.
19;5;258;4;0.015503875968992248;yes. so obviously, one of the biggest drivers over the last recent while in card revenues has been the extraordinary success we've had in capturing new chase sapphire reserve accounts. and so the end of the third quarter both -- importantly, both the fourth quarter and the first quarter were extraordinary in terms of the number of accounts we acquired. and of course, we amortize or contra revenue out those expenses over 1 year. so at 10.5% revenue rate right now and with those -- having adjusted the premium with those originations stabilizing out into the second quarter, we will see ultimately -- we'll lap that impact a year from now. and we'll see our revenue rate start improving from here towards the 11.25% that we sort of guided to in the medium term. and we expect to get to that point, all other things equal, kind of mid-next year. and of course, that's just one facet. we're also seeing significant momentum on the sales front. obviously, as a result of those accounts, we're growing our core loans, up 8%. and so we're having higher nii on those balances. so there's a lot of dry powder. we just need to get past these account acquisition costs, which we will. and i always feel compelled to point out that these are extraordinarily good customers. their characteristics, their engagement, their spend, these are the customers that everybody wants to acquire. we now have them, and we intend to deepen relationships with them.
19;6;190;1;0.005263157894736842;so i would characterize our strategy as unchanged. we've always been pretty consistent over an extended period that we would prioritize, first and foremost, strategic investments for growth in our businesses, be that organic or otherwise. and obviously, you've seen us be investing, whether it's in growing loans or introducing new product, hiring bankers, opening offices in our expansion markets and the like. but yes, it's been heavily skewed to being organic over the most recent while. we've also been pretty clear and active, i would say, in terms of partnering with, investing in, collaborating with partners that can accelerate our growth potential. so we would always be interested, whether that's fintech or otherwise, in getting capabilities that allow us to accelerate our growth potential. we do not have big gaps, but we would always be interested in that. having said that, i'm not going to comment on the state of the regulatory environment except to say you should expect, for any of these events or transactions, that we would have the appropriate regulators at the -- conversation with regulators at the appropriate time.
19;7;157;2;0.012738853503184714;yes. so obviously, we are supportive of the new hedge accounting rules, and it will allow us to consider taking advantage of hedge accounting for a wiser set of products than we currently do. but we actually have reasonably limited hedge ineffectiveness in our (inaudible) right now. so from a practical perspective, it will not make a big difference to the business, but it is more flexibility in terms of the scope. and we're looking at that. i would just add, as a policy matter, we make economic decisions, not accounting decisions. accounting is a fiction. and marianne spoke about the credit card. you expense the acquisition costs over 12 months. the benefit comes over 7 years. so we make huge investments all the time based on economics. we will never make a decision based upon accounting. and then we'll describe it to our shareholders to understand why we're doing what we're doing.
19;8;40;0;0.0;yes, it's seasonality. so you've seen the first half at or around that guidance level. we would expect that to go down slightly just from seasonality in the second half for a full year a bit below 3%.
19;9;79;1;0.012658227848101266;so i would say, obviously anytime you reach an inflection point, you need to be cautious about understanding the pace of change. for -- at least for 2018, 3% to 3.25% feels right. i think as -- when you get beyond that, we'll be updating you with our views as we experience a bit more in reality. it does not feel significantly different from that, but i think 2018 is a good number. and 2019, we'll update you.
19;10;262;1;0.003816793893129771;yes. okay, so just talk about what we've seen so far, i think the industry has been really quite disciplined, which is what we would have expected at this early stage of a normalization in terms of the rate cycle. it is a tale of 2 cities. we've said that (inaudible) the wholesale space necessarily experiences higher reprice more quickly, and we are seeing that pretty much in line with our expectations. it matters, you need to get granular. the type of deposit, that client segmentation, it matters. so in the wholesale space, we're seeing it. we're on that journey. in the retail space, we have not seen that yet. so while there have been small changes in the industry in cds, there's been nothing in checking or savings. but again, i'd just point out to you that we would not have expected there to be at this point yet in the cycle. and i would say, with respect to deposit betas and the fed's balance sheet, if we are right, and we believe we'll be close to right, and that we see the wholesale nonoperating deposit flowing out of the system, assuming everybody else has reached that same conclusion, then it really should not materially impact the liquidity position of financial institutions. and if you couple that with the expectation of a very gradual and measured pace, which gives people a lot of time and opportunity to plan accordingly, we would not expect there to be a significant impact on betas, if any.
19;11;187;0;0.0;yes. i would say -- first of all, i would say, focusing on any one -- so we would be very supportive of changes to how operational the capital is treated under [reg] capital rules. but i think focusing on one facet and not the whole thing -- it's unlikely to be that only one thing changes. so we'd like to see changes made over time. but for the foreseeable future, as we're growing our loans quite strongly, and these are extraordinarily high-quality loans where the differential between advanced and standardized is quite big, we still expect standardized to bind us. and as you pointed out, the standardized were 100% in the united states. in europe, they're talking about 75%. so there are -- will be some changes over time in how all these capital ratios get calculated for international competitiveness reasons. yes. so whether it's because the operational risk rules change or whether it's because the standardized rules become at least somewhat more risk sensitive, there should be changes over time, but i think for the foreseeable future, this is what we expect.
19;12;604;8;0.013245033112582781;yes. so i would start with, if you go back a couple of years ago, 2013, '14, '15, when we were doing our business simplification agenda and derisking and uplifting the controlled environment, the commercial bank was blocking and tackling and doing a lot of inwardly focused work. and we talked, i think, all the way back in 2016, that there were outbound calls, opening offices, hiring bankers, and that if you waited a minute, you'd see that come to our results. and this is the sort of fruits of that labor. so i do think it is sustainable. there's nothing in these results that is particularly noisy outside of reserve releases, which i'll come back to. and i would also say the partnership between the commercial bank and the ib in terms of covering our clients, the introduction of 16 specialized industries, which is an advantage we can bring to our clients nationally and, in fact, globally, that other competitors can not bring, all of those things set us up for continued solid growth. with respect to loan growth, i would say, if you look at our c&i loans, this quarter, as an example, was pretty broad based. there was not a specific -- in the middle market, there was not a specific industry or market segment that was strong. but over the last -- stronger, i should say. but over the last few years, a lot of our growth has been driven by the investments we've been making in the expansion markets. so we got into some new markets with the wamu acquisition. we continued to build out those markets, add bankers, open offices. and that has been a source of growth for us that perhaps others have not been able to enjoy. and also, as i said, specialized industries. and then... and i would just add, we -- i think we're in all major 50 markets now, unlike retail, where, one day, we'll embark on an expansion in cities we're not in. and the product set is just fabulous. we're adding more and more online things. we're adding simpler and faster credit approvals. we're adding -- making it easier to do merchant processing when you sign up for middle market loans. the online systems are great. so all that stuff, i think is -- this is going to grow for a long period of time. all right. and then... and thanks for pointing out how well it did. and doug petno, if you're listening, congratulations. and then the only thing i would say on commercial real estate, just because i think it's really important, is commercial real estate, it depends what you do. and more than half of our commercial real estate exposure is commercial term lending. it's a very specific strategy. we do not deviate from that strategy. and i would just point to you, because it was interesting to me, if you look at the fed's ccar stress results for commercial real estate across the industry and look at how our results compared to others, i think you can hopefully get somewhat more comfortable, and we are very comfortable with what we have right now. now that said, the performance this quarter did benefit from reserve releases and benign credit, and at some point, there will be a cycle. but the risk appetite we have and the way we've managed with discipline, we're very happy with that. and the ib, bringing jpmorgan investment banking to chase corporate clients, we still think has a long way to go.
19;13;592;7;0.011824324324324325;i would look at it the other way around. so we've, for -- since the great recession, okay, which is now 8 years old, we've been growing at 1.5% to 2% in spite of stupidity and political gridlock because the american business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless -- when they wake up in the morning, they want to feed their kids, they want to buy a home, and they want to do things. it's the same with american businesses. my -- what i'm saying is that it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and were there not gridlock. and thank you for pointing it out because i'm going to be a broken record until this gets done. we are unable to build bridges. we're unable to build airports. our inner city schoolkids and are not graduating. i was just in france. i was recently in argentina. i was in israel. i was in ireland. we met with the prime minister of india and china. it's amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies that promote business and growth is good for the average citizens of those countries, for jobs and wages, and that somehow this great american free enterprise system, we no longer get it. and so my view is it -- and corporate taxation is critical to that, by the way. we've been driving capital and bringing it overseas, which is why there's $2 trillion sitting overseas, benefiting all these other countries and stuff like that. so if we do not get our act together, we can still grow. i would say it's unfortunate, but it's hurting us. it's hurting the body politic. it's hurting the average american that we do not have these right policies. and so no, in spite of gridlock, we'll grow at -- we can grow at 1.5% or 2%. i do not buy the argument that we're relegated to this forever SEMICOLON we're not. and if this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure, regulatory reform -- we have become the most -- one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet. it's almost an embarrassment being an american citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid (expletive) we have to deal with in this country. and at one point, we all have to get our act together or we will not do what we're supposed to do for the average americans. and unfortunately, people write about the thing like it's for corporations. it's not for corporations. competitive taxes are important for business and business growth, which is important for jobs and wage growth. and honestly, we should be ringing that alarm bell, every single one of you, every time you talk to a client. and then i would just say that in terms of how our clients are behaving and how the (inaudible) going, whether you look at middle markets, corporate client banking, m&a, it's not to say that the possibilities of reform and the impact that, that could have is not a part of the dialogue, but they're fundamentally really just getting on with things. and so if there's a client that has a compelling strategic deal to be done or some spending or hiring or growth, then they're pretty much getting on with it, which is why we're seeing solid growth.
19;14;404;1;0.0024752475247524753;yes. so look, obviously, you know the deal with ccar approvals, which is it is capacity. it's not necessarily a commitment to utilize it, although we are -- as we fairly clearly articulated at investor day and as you see in the numbers here, we are at 12.5% in terms of our cet1. and we believe we ought to be able to, over time, operate the company lower than that, within the range of 11% to 12.5%, albeit that we would take time to do that. so we're in the market buying our stock every day. we're at 1.8x tangible book value. so in jamie's shareholder letter, we still think that there's significant value in the stock. we believe in the earnings power in the franchise that we have here. and so i'm not to say that we will utilize all the capacity because other things can come up, but we put in the request based upon our desire to want to ultimately move lower. yes. and there's a very important policy issue here, too. so our preference is always to build organically, to not buy back stock but to build branches and grow and lend more. but there's an argument that people are making that banks can not lend it, and even if there is excess lending capability, they would not have done it. and that is not true. the counterfactual would have been, had banks been free to use their capital and their liquidity 5 years ago, there would have been a lot more lending in the system. and we've pointed out 2 areas where it would have taken place. one is mortgages, where regulations have held back lending to first-time buyers, immigrants, self-employed, prior defaults, et cetera. and the second is small business, where it's not existing small businesses, think of it as start-up small businesses and that they are having a hard time getting capital maybe at the community bank level, et cetera. the counterfactual would have been that $1 trillion or $2 trillion would have been lent out had these rules been changed 5 years ago. that's the counterfactual. it's not that, well, the banks would not have lent the money. and so again, there's a false notion that all this stuff did not hold back the economy. yes, it did.
19;15;204;1;0.004901960784313725;yes. so obviously, they have not been specific. although the treasury report had some ideas, they have not been specific about what the calibration would look like and whether there would be recalibration to the numerator and the denominator or one or the other. clearly, we've been pretty clear that we think cash at central banks should not necessarily be included, and there are other things. different people have different opinions. so we've done the calculations. i would just point you back to the fact that we have some 20 potentially binding constraints right now, of which leverage in a variety of forms is part of that. so to the degree that we get the opportunity to recalibrate that, it could have impact at the margin. but we take all of those things into consideration when we think about the direction of travel of the company. so we're being as thoughtful as we can. we are not specifically leverage constrained right now. that does not mean we're not supportive of making those changes and we will obviously model it out. but we take the potential for those changes into consideration when we think about the direction we grow our businesses.
19;16;314;5;0.01592356687898089;so i think -- i want to point out something because i know that sapphire reserve gets a significant amount of attention for obvious and good reasons. but it is only one product in a platform of successful products, both proprietary and co-brand. and so in reality, while we obviously do all the modeling and the math, it's not about what the cost of any one individual card acquired is or the npv of that, it's how the portfolios ultimately together perform over time. and it's still very early on sapphire reserve. i mean, it's not even a year old yet. and these are portfolios and products that develop and season over time. and as i said, these are extraordinarily good customer relationships. so you know we've done a bunch of things in the card business over the last few years. we've renegotiated our co-brands. that was ultimately with lower economics but still very good economics. we've been out on the front foot issuing new products, not just sapphire reserve but freedom unlimited, the amazon prime card, ink. and so we think about everything in the total portfolio and its collective performance over time, and it's still generating very good returns. let me just mention about the regulatory slr. so looking at it very broadly, if you look at -- it's not just capital liquidity but mortgage rules, requirements, capital liquidity, collateral rules, what collateral can be used and not used, if these things were just calibrated differently, the cost of credit would go down, swap spreads would go down, mortgage would become more available, the cost of mortgage will come down. and those are kind of important in total if they're done right without changing at all the risk to the system. in fact, the system is healthier if the economy is healthier.
19;17;105;0;0.0;so when we think about the sort of liquidity position of this company, we're obviously managing not just to regulatory requirements but also to what we want the ultimate sort of duration of equity and position of our balance sheet to be through the cycle. so we take into consideration not just the amount of liquidity we have and how that could be utilized but also the mortgage portfolio we have, agency mbs. so all of that goes into our determinations. and we will continue to add to duration opportunistically when it makes sense to do it and manage our balance sheet with discipline.
19;18;182;1;0.005494505494505495;yes. so i would start by saying that a lot can change between now and the next cycle of ccar or the next 2 cycles of ccar. and so we never did actually say that we necessarily wanted to get the low end of the range but just to operate for the short and medium term within the range while we let all of the potential changes to the sort of regulatory environment at large play out. and so as to whether or not, over time, there's a sort of recalibration of whether 11% is our minimum, that will play out over time. so for the next 1 or 2 cycles of ccar, this cycle and the next one, i would just expect that we want to be on a measured pace to be within the range to allow us to better understand all of the changes that will take place over time and make appropriate decisions. i would not start imagining necessarily how low that goes. i think we would want to operate with a sufficiency of capital and liquidity.
19;19;230;2;0.008695652173913044;so i would say, of course, it's possible. we've seen a number of situations where implementing global standards in the u.s. have differed in meaningful ways from how they've been implemented elsewhere. you have rarely seen that be to the advantage of the u.s., and the slr is no exception. so while there may be recalibrations of either the numerator or denominator, know that to the europeans, 3% standard. our current depository institutions are held to a 6% standard. so there's plenty of room for there to be adjustments before it would create an unlevel playing field. and my suspicion is there will also be adjustments elsewhere. and it's supposed to be, as i think chairman -- chairwoman yellen said, a backstop, not binding in the way that perhaps it has become. so i think the answer is yes, but we'll see. so -- and the key point marianne said is almost every single thing that's been done in america added to basel requirements, the gold plating, slr, calculation of lcr, calculation of stress, g-sib, almost every single thing. and remember, america does not have to listen to basel either. and you may -- we may have noticed that basically france, germany, india, china are all telling basel they better take a deep breath and stop doing more of what they're doing.
19;20;213;0;0.0;and so -- sorry, go ahead. go ahead, go ahead. no. so look, there are a number of different people talking about the forward-looking standard for operational risk, basel -- under basel iii.5 or iv or whatever is talking about it, there were some proposals in the choice act. so there's no question that there should be a revisitation of the mechanism to calculate operational risk. and then you're right, the way that all of these rules ultimately interplay with each other matters. and so from a pure stress test perspective, at the margin, we had a little bit more binding constraint on leverage than cet1. but if you look at just what we could run the company at if ccar was the only constraint, it would be lower than where we are. so it's a complicated dynamic of trying to make sure that we're maximizing against all of these constraints and not just the mathematical ones but also the operational and practical ones. so i mean, it's necessary to go back and rethink the calculation of operational risk just because it's the right thing to do. ultimately, how that plays out into how we optimize against our constraints is less of what we're focused on.
19;21;41;0;0.0;i would not imagine -- it's not going to change our risk management strategy in a meaningful way, so i would not imagine it would be... just the (inaudible) corporations, though. the new hedging rules would affect other corporations are nonbanks.
19;22;25;0;0.0;we have not looked at whether it creates more demand from the other -- from the corporate side. so we'll look at that and see.
19;23;217;2;0.009216589861751152;no. it is still this quarter. there are requirements to make public disclosures in august. so depending on whether you make them in your q, in your pillar 3 or not will determine whether it's the beginning or middle or end of august. we, as you know, have -- as an industry, are being quite public about the fact that we think -- by the way, we provide an extraordinary amount of real-time granular -- same-day granular information on liquidity to our regulators in order for them to be able to properly supervise not just us but the system. and so we believe the regulators do have and can have anything they need when they need it. it's just a question about whether there is any added benefit of those informations being made public near real time. while it would not matter today when everyone's running very significant liquidity surpluses, it could have unintended consequences if we were in an environment that was more stressful than we are today. so right now, the requirement is that we have to disclose. i suspect, although we've asked for a delay, as an industry, that we might have to disclose. we will continue to debate, i think, with regulators the merits of those public disclosures over time.
19;24;367;3;0.008174386920980926;yes. and we -- i mean, i would suggest, although it's not something we show you every quarter, that we've been pretty forthcoming about showing you the level of our deposits and the split, at least in investor day now and then, between operating and nonoperating deposits. and as we start to see the impacts of the fed balance sheet unwind and the like, we will be very forthcoming. we try to be incredibly transparent, and we'll take that under advisement, regardless of what the regulatory disclosures are about the quality of our deposit franchise. but we have, i think, periodically, been more disclosive than most in terms of the quality of our deposits. and knowing that, you could see that we have $500 billion of cash, $300 billion of securities, $300 billion of repo. i mean, it's a pretty liquid company, as liquid as any bank i've ever seen on this planet. and... and we removed $200 billion of nonoperating deposits proactively. so we manage it very carefully. yes. there's nothing that would happen because of all this that would affect jpmorgan that much. and the very important thing about lcr, it's not -- we -- it does not affect us, okay? we're fine disclosing whatever they want us to disclose. it's an issue of whether the monetary -- whether it's good for monetary policy. and would it -- will it cause a problem, not for us, for the system when there's a crisis. like do they want banks to use their liquidity or not? very simple. because if the answer is you've got to maintain over 100%, then you can not use your liquidity. that's what it means. and then so they -- and they've said publicly -- some of have said publically that, "well, if there's a crisis, we'll let you go below 100%." and we're saying, "well, what bank is going to be the first to go below 100%?" and so it's kind of a policy issue. whatever happens, we're completely fine at jpmorgan. if i were the regulators, i would not want to put myself in that kind of position.
20;1;86;0;0.0;so betsy, there's no change in our transfer pricing methodology or even the way we compute it. it's to do, as you appreciate, with, obviously, higher rates and the fact that we are in a very disciplined environment at this point on deposit reprice. we would expect to continue to see the margin expand over the course of the next several quarters, but we would also expect to continue to drive higher nii as we're growing our deposits. [and those remain] in ftp.
20;2;2;0;0.0;yes, yes.
20;3;392;5;0.012755102040816327;yes. so i mean, i think the way to think about it, not to sort of diminish the importance of any individual breach or situation, is that we are, honestly, under constant attack both in a more general side, but also from a fraud perspective. and so while we will always react and learn lessons from every individual situation, this is not the first breach, nor will it be the last breach. and so as a result, we have been constantly evolving and refining the way we think about fraud prevention, detection, underwriting, continuing to move to multifactor protocols around customer identification, looking to leverage all of our data to sort of better inform our underwriting decisions. so the reality is that, as important as it is and as much as we -- as each individual breach could impact the overall equation, we have had to evolve over an extended period to the position that we're in now. and so as a direct result of this, there will not be specific, meaningful changes, but a continuous evolution. and so when we are looking whether it's at sending out preapprovals or marketing offers or receiving inbound applications, we are increasingly looking at a number of different data points and facts to be able to identify the customer and understand the application. and just -- let me add. as part of a breach -- so if your name was taken, and we know that as social security, a driver's license, we can put in a lot of enhanced controls that we do about your name specifically. we do not have to rely on those things. we can reduce reliance. we can greatly, dramatically include antifraud on your account. so we do, do that to dramatically diminish any effect on our customers. and the reality, betsy, is that we kind of operated over an extended period now on the presumption that while we happen to know about this breach, there will be others either right now that we do not know about or over time. and so we have to be proactive, not reactive. and we'll obviously look to learn anything we can, but we continue to evolve so that we can use all of the information at our fingertips. and as a practical matter, we are not seeing a specific increase in fraud.
20;4;78;0;0.0;correct, correct. as a result, we're already spending the money that we need to spend to keep, hopefully, ahead of the curve on all of these things. our operating losses are -- i will say, the combination of all of the information that has been compromised over the course of the last several years has put pressure on fraud costs, but nothing incremental from this. and so no impact on expenses or loan growth that would be measurable.
20;5;424;1;0.0023584905660377358;yes. so look, we -- obviously, apart from the rate hike in june, nothing has really happened much since last quarter. and so the landscape is looking pretty similar, and -- not because that's surprising, so i'll come back to that in a second, which is to say that there's been very little to no movement in the repricing of deposit accounts. there's been some incremental movements in certain savings and cds, but nothing systematic in the consumer space. but that's pretty much as we would have expected with rates at these absolute levels. and so at some point in time, and that may be a couple, 3 more rate hikes from now, the dynamic may start to change, and so we have not changed our perspective about what we think the ultimate reprice will look like. in asset & wealth management, the story on deposit pricing is somewhat similar. a little bit more movement, but nothing particularly meaningful or dramatic. the story there is very much, again, as expected. at these levels of rates, you are seeing customers start to make choices to move certain of their deposit balances into investment assets. that's normal migration, migration that we expected and that we've modeled, and we are retaining those balances. so we are starting to see some of the dynamics we expected play out. that started happening at the beginning of the year and has continued to progress. and then in the wholesale space, there is a spectrum as well. so i would start with we're firmly on a reprice journey in wholesale, no doubt. and depending on where you are in the spectrum, it ranges from the smaller and lower middle market companies, where the reprice is modest, but present to the higher end, where it's reasonably high. and so overall, if i step back, that's where we are. if i step back and say, "have we learned something new in this cycle that we did not know?" the answer is, "no, not really." if you look at the first 4 rate hikes of the previous normalization cycle, the overall cumulative deposit reprice was pretty much the same as it is now. so we continue to believe that the dynamics that we've been talking about over the last several years and that we've expected will play out. they may not play out exactly as we have them modeled, but they will ultimately play out that way and that we have appropriately conservative reprice assumptions.
20;6;255;5;0.0196078431372549;so at the risk of sort of hedging, it's actually a bit of both. the reality is there's always been 2 different camps on the reprice theories for consumer. there's been the camp of acute market awareness, low for long, technology enhancements allow movement of money to be easier, competition for retail deposits and good liquidity deposit is high. therefore, reprice higher. and the counter to that, which has merit and which we are seeing to a degree, is customers feel that they're weighing a more balanced scorecard of things when they choose where to keep their deposits. and customer satisfaction, the suite of products and simplicity, the digital and online offerings as well as the safety, security and brand all matter and that price is a factor, but not the only one. so i would say we certainly feel that having a leading digital capability is critical to, overall, our customer franchise, and it will, in all likelihood, have an impact on the stickiness of deposits because customers value that kind of convenience very highly. i would also say one other thing about where we are right now, is that, as you know, as much as you're right about the sort of potential demand for these sort of high-liquidity value deposits, there's a lot of excess liquidity in the banking system. and although loan growth is solid, it's solid. so we are not seeing a frenzy, albeit that we're very proud of our deposit growth.
20;7;3;0;0.0;yes, welcome back.
20;8;18;0;0.0;i do not have that off the top of my head, but we can get back to you.
20;9;39;0;0.0;i fear -- here's what we'll do. i fear if i give you a ballpark, i'll get it wrong. while we're on the call, we'll get someone to send the details and let you know.
20;10;216;1;0.004629629629629629;so we're doing a bit of all of the above. so i'll start with the comment which you heard from us before, but which we still strongly defend, which is that branches still matter. that 75% of our growth in deposits came from customers who have been using our branches. that, on average, a customer comes into our branches multiple times in a quarter. so i know that all sounds like old news, but it's still new news at -- or current news. so the branch distribution network matters. customer preferences are changing, and we are not being complacent to that. so we are, underneath the overall 5,000-plus branches, continuing to consolidate, close, move, grow, change all of our branches in line with the opportunity in the market that we're in. so net for the year, we'll be down about 125 branches. we've closed more than that, consolidated some and added some. so we're not being complacent to the consumer preference story. but branches still matter a lot, and we're building out all of the other sort of omni-channel pieces, as you know, so that we have the complete offering. and if the customer behaviors start changing in a more accelerated fashion, we will respond accordingly.
20;11;126;2;0.015873015873015872;yes. so i would characterize this as -- over the 2 quarters of normal. so you may recall last quarter, there were a couple of things that we talked about. first was that there was a $75 million sort of onetime interest adjustment in mortgage, which artificially reduced loan yields for the quarter. and secondly, that seasonality and mix in card similarly. so we would normally, in the law of extraordinarily big numbers, expect for a 25 basis point rate hike that we'd see about 10-ish basis points of improvement in loan yields across the whole portfolio. we did not see that last quarter. what you're seeing this quarter is the reversal of those factors and the normal benefit of the june rate hike.
20;12;110;0;0.0;yes. so as we look at the loss rates for this year, they're coming in, as we expected, at less than 3%. and as we look out to next year, based on what we know today, it's still in that 3% to 3.25% range, albeit maybe at the higher end of that range. so it's broadly in line with our expectations. so the reserve build -- and we -- in the consumer space, we move our reserves in -- not in dollar increments. but the reserve build is about a little less than 1/3 on the growth and a little more than 2/3 on normalization of rate.
20;13;5;0;0.0;i think that was about...
20;14;155;1;0.0064516129032258064;yes. so -- yes, nii, so a couple of things. the first is just to sort of repeat the standard. just as a sort of macro matter, we're more sensitive to the front end of rates than to the long end of rates, particularly over any short period of time. and so intra-quarter volatility in the 10-year, while it's not nothing, it's not like it would have a material impact on the run rate. we're -- clearly, an overall generally flatter long end of the curve, in general, on average, through the year, all other things being equal, will have had a dampening pressure on our expectations. and it's part of the reason why they went from 4.5% to 4%, not the only one, as we progress through the year. but generally speaking, intra-quarter volatility is not something that would have a meaningful impact on our run rate.
20;15;574;5;0.008710801393728223;okay. so on the first, i think it's quite important to, like, not look at the average and to kind of decompose it into constituent parts. because we've talked before about the fact that we use our balance sheet strategically in cib, but loan growth is not really a thing there. and so this quarter, we saw no loan growth in cib. so no big deal, but it means that, that 7.5% core growth for the whole portfolio would have been, outside of cib, closer to 9%. so start with that. consumer has been pretty consistent. so across the consumer space, whether it's our jumbo mortgages, whether it's the business banking, card, auto loans and leases, they've been growing at reasonably solid and consistent high single-digit territory or even low double digit for mortgage over the last several quarters. and at this point, we do not really see anything that is suggesting that, that will moderate meaningfully. so where you're seeing -- and similarly, in asset & wealth management on the banking side. so really, where you're seeing the growth moderate is in commercial, and it's in both the c&i loans and the commercial real estate loans. and they each have a story. with the commercial -- with the c&i loans, for us, the story is about moving from meaningfully outperforming the industry to being more in line with the industry. so over the course of the last couple of years, as we've added expansion market, opened new offices, added a couple hundred bankers, developed our specialized industry coverage models, we've been growing meaningfully better than the industry. and so you see that even in this quarter in our year-on-year growth, 8%, as compared to the quarter-on-quarter growth, where it is flatter. and that, to me, is really a factor of the fact that in this stage of the cycle, our clients have strong balance sheets. they have a lot of liquidity. they have had access to the capital market. and so gdp-plus growth is not unlikely to be a level for the foreseeable future. with commercial real estate, it's slightly different. we're still outpacing the industry, but we've kind of gone from very strong to strong, and we would continue to expect that to slowly moderate. and that's a number of things. it's some higher rates. it's actually a lot of competition. and then it's a lot also about client selectivity given where we are in the cycle. so we are being very cautious about new deals that we add to the pipeline and the client selection that we have. so all of those factors, i think, weigh into the commercial real estate space. just -- tax reform, so fiscal stimulus. the reality right now is, although i think everyone and ourselves included are hopeful, obviously, that tax reform is done for the right reasons and that the economy responds accordingly, at this point, it's not front and center in the dialogue we're having with our clients about whether they should or should not do a strategic deal or take an action. so i would say it's neither holding up business, nor spurring business, but that could change. so at this point, i'd say it's a factor, but not a driving factor, and that could change.
20;16;81;0;0.0;well, so -- i mean, we'll just deal with the fourth quarter because i think the landscape of rate hikes for 2018 is an open question. but no, we would expect loan yields to hold relatively flat, all other things being equal. it's a very competitive environment. we are not seeing -- we're seeing some pressure in commercial real estate spreads. we're seeing, generally, spreads holding up. but i would expect competitive pressures to keep loan yields relatively flat.
20;17;169;1;0.005917159763313609;yes. so we are -- at this point, we are, at that 3% charge-off rate, rising to 3% to 3.25% next year and growing, so you should continue to expect that we'll be adding to reserves. our outlook for reserve adds next quarter is below this quarter. but obviously, we will continue to observe that. and with respect to the hurricanes, right now, in this quarter's results, in the credit lines, in mortgage particularly, and to a much lesser degree, in wholesale, we built -- effectively built $55 million of reserves. to sort of contextualize that, we have used our unfortunate experiences of sandy and andrew and other natural disasters to calibrate the assumptions we're using. at this point, it's early to be able to say how the losses will actually manifest themselves. it could be that it's lower than that, but that's also the central case right now, $50 million in mortgage and just a handful of million in the wholesale space.
20;18;224;7;0.03125;yes. so i'll just start with a bit of a philosophical discussion, which is it is our opinion that now, as much, if not more so than ever, the investments we're making in technology will effectively breed and deliver the efficiency. so to the degree that we are able to find incremental investments or accelerate them, we'll be willing to do that. and our expense numbers, our outlook has never -- have never been target. so that's just a sort of mental -- philosophical point of view that we would deliver any technology innovation and investments that we could execute well, that we think would be either accretive to our returns through revenues or efficiency. specifically, when you look at the simulation, this is a point of technicality. in 2018, middle -- probably middle to third quarter of 2018, we are expecting that the fdic dif fund will reach its level at which the surcharge will be able to be reduced. that's a meaningful positive for us. and so if you look at the implied growth in expenses from '17 through the medium term, they are larger than is implied. but if we found the opportunity to do more or to accelerate more, we would do it and explain it to you. so we'll come back to that at investor day.
20;19;156;1;0.00641025641025641;yes. i think i'm -- so when we did some conferences at the end of the last year, i think that we said that we'd expect the revenue rates for the full year this year to be 10.5%, and it will be a little better than that. and the revenue rate increase in the quarter speaks to a little bit of spread and a little bit of lower premium. it will go down the next quarter because of the fourth quarter effect of the sapphire reserve travel credit for overall, call it, 10.6% for the year. but yes, we do expect to hit the 11.25% in the first half of next year. and we've reached the inflection point end of the third -- second quarter and into the third quarter, where growth is offsetting the impacts of the significant upfront investments in sapphire reserve. then we'll see revenues grew from here.
20;20;352;3;0.008522727272727272;yes. so i'll just start with credit for a second because although we absolutely expect at some point that we're going to see normalization of credit -- we have not seen that yet, i just want to make that clear, that we are appropriately cautious in sharing everything, but we're not seeing any deterioration or any thematic fragility in our portfolio that we're concerned about at this point. with respect to the revenue side of the story and the efficiency side, i mean, it really is a story of all of the things you mentioned sort of all coming together at the same time. so we have been adding to -- we have our expansion markets from the walmart acquisition. we've been adding new markets and opening offices. we've been adding bankers. and as you know... we're in all 50 of the top msa now. yes. we are in all 50 of our top msas now. and we've been adding bankers. and as you know, when you add all of these investments, for a period of time, when they are still in the buildup mode, you do not see that drop to the bottom line or to the top line. and now we're starting to see our bankers hit their stride, become very productive, the balances are building. and then i would also say that this is a -- the epicenter of delivering the whole platform to our clients. so if you think about what we're able to offer our clients in terms of international capabilities, banking coverage across industries, core cash, global payments, we have a platform offering, i think, that is -- well, it's certainly complete, and it's somewhat differentiated. and then the third thing i would say is that it's a buttoned-up business. we have been looking at efficiency and expenses and really working on making sure that due to simplification processes that we went through in 2013, '14 and '15, that we are focusing all of our efforts on our core strategic clients, and it's paying off.
20;21;107;4;0.037383177570093455;yes. so i would say it's almost -- like you said, there are so many uncertainties that it's almost talking about hypothetical at this point, as encouraged as we are with the ongoing dialogue. my view is sentiment is relatively high. in fact, it's ticked up slightly over the course of the last short while. so from that vantage point, we're in a position of strength. and there would necessarily be some lag, so whether that is a couple of quarters or longer. so certainly, in the foreseeable future, you would hope to be able to see increased demand and confidence leading to action.
20;22;285;2;0.007017543859649123;yes. so i'll start with the excess liquidity question because while we feel very, very good about our liquidity position, and you will have seen in the recent disclosures where everyone is positioned and necessarily, even if lcr was the only consideration, people would want to be running a basel ii lcr. so -- but lcr is not the only consideration. and the other most notable one i would point out to you would be resolution planning. so know that when we have our overall liquidity position, we're taking into consideration a combination of constraints. and so what may look excess in one -- on one lever may not be as excess on another. the second i would say is that when we look at the deployment of our hqla, we look at it in the context of our sort of target for what we want the duration of equity for the company to be over the course of the normalization in rates. and obviously, it's not just about liquidity. it's also about duration. so we're comfortable with our liquidity position. we have a framework for deploying it and for thinking about the spot and forward-looking duration of the company. that's not to say that we are not opportunistic in taking advantage of moves that are technical in the long end of rates to either deploy or to undeploy dry powder, and we still have some. so it's more than just liquidity. it's also duration, and we've taken the overall balance sheet and our expectations and our target into consideration, albeit that we still have some dry powder. and we maximize for between loans, securities. yes, yes.
20;23;97;0;0.0;so it will be over the short while, and our full expectation outside of any other, like, stimulation is that as the front end of rates goes up and as gradual qe unwind happens, that you're going to see the long end of rates go up, albeit more slowly. so it's pretty typical at this point in the normalization cycle to have a curve flattened. that's what we're seeing. that's what we would expect. i would expect to continue to see the long end rise. and yes, it should be nim-accretive.
20;24;163;2;0.012269938650306749;so i would say it's wallet share. it's blocking and tackling. we did pretty well in europe, and -- but there is still a lot of competition. so i would say it's less about the specifics of any one competitor because the environment is pretty competitive and just about sort of reasonably broad strength. two things that i would also point out is, the first, in equity underwriting, similar to -- in ficc, we gained a couple hundred basis points a share in the third quarter of last year. so on an apples-to-apples basis to where we would normally expect our shares to be, we're still doing very well. i would just say, i think the competition is fundamentally fully back. yes. it's not that they're -- or most of these players are all out there. some specialize in certain areas, but it's fully competitive. and you have new entrants soon, like the chinese banks, et cetera.
20;25;211;3;0.014218009478672985;okay, that was a lot. so look, first of all, we welcomed the report. and it's a long report, a couple hundred pages. there's a lot of recommendations, very comprehensive. so kudos to the treasury for delivering it. and we are supportive of those recommendations kind of at large. and i think the most important thing to remind you is that this is not about materially changing the legislative landscape. it's about recalibrating -- sensibly recalibrating the specifics of individual rules over time. and so we're still digesting the report, but we are supportive. it is very comprehensive, and it could be very beneficial to the liquidity and depth of the capital market, which is what we should all hope for and not contrary to safety and soundness. so in that sense, very supportive, all good. it's going to be complicated, and it will take time, but the will is there. and so whether it's the administration or the regulators, there's a general recognition that there's the ability and the appetite to want to make rational change. and so if that helps to grow the economy and all the things that come with that, we're working as constructively as we can on that.
20;26;87;0;0.0;yes, so we're building, obviously, kind of beta platforms for trading and investing and things like that. and also, the p2p, zelle which is doing quite well. we look at all those things as things you want to -- from the client standpoint, we want to offer to a client. and at one point, we'll be talking about a more -- testing what we think might or might not work, and then we'll give you more of a strategic view of that probably around investor day.
20;27;129;0;0.0;so we have a fairly large mortgage loan portfolio in addition to having a large portfolio in our investment securities in mbs. so we are already reasonably equivalently mixed in terms of our percentage of mortgage exposure to our total assets or loans to the competitive landscape. and so trust me when i tell you that you talk about excess liquidity because of lcr and we are thinking about more than just lcr. and we do -- as i said, while we do maintain a short position and the cost of being short is relatively cheap, we do not have the kind of capacity to invest $100-plus billion in mbs right now or anything that's meaningful like that to generate higher returns without blowing through our duration target.
20;28;81;2;0.024691358024691357;no, no, no. we have not. we -- as we talked about before -- a while ago, we made some surgical changes to our credit box in the card space, but that's, if anything, i would say, incredibly granular, incredibly surgically tightening, not the reverse. whether that's in card, in certain micro sales or whether that's in auto, i would say we've been pretty conservative. and we're probably doing, at the very margin, a little bit of tightening.
20;29;273;2;0.007326007326007326;no. so i mean, congratulations to them if they have a high degree of confidence on what 2018 ccar is going to look like. so i will tell you this. we said very clearly that we feel that the company should operate within the range of 11% to 12.5%. we feel like it should be lower in that range. and having a capital plan approved of $19.4 billion of share buybacks over the next 4 quarters and over 100% payout based on analyst estimates is a start. so nothing has changed about that objective, but we would want to be measured about the pace at which we do it until we have a bit more final clarity on what the new generation of capital rules will look like. so we hopefully will know more as we go into the next cycle of capital planning. we have not changed our point of view that we should be able to continue that journey down into the range, and that would be our objective. to tell you that we can give you the road map for that today, i think, is not accurate. so -- but you can do your -- you can and you have done your own math. you can -- your base -- look at our earning outlook in your earnings models and payouts of over 100%, and you can see that we can move down in that same time frame to something much lower than we are now. it's not towards the bottom, but that's not to say that we will be able to do that. we need to go through tests.
20;30;165;2;0.012121212121212121;yes. so i think i got that. so the compliance burden and the readiness and the work to be ready is a significant heavy lift not just for us, but, as you say, for all market participants. and so there is the possibility that effective at the beginning of the year, there will be ongoing work that needs to get done. we feel like we're reasonably well positioned and -- to defend our position. but there's no doubt that over the course of the year and beyond that people get clearer and clearer on transparency and cost to execute versus advice versus content that there may be competitive dynamics to change. and we feel like we've been building for the last several years to be ready for those dynamics. so there could be some bumps. i do not think it's anything that we're concerned about at this point, and we will all learn a little more as we go through 2018.
20;31;152;1;0.006578947368421052;so i would say that, for sure, has to be part of it. and even with the auto situation, what you're seeing is, i think, a marketplace that is much more responsive. so while we felt like we got ahead of the issues and tightened early, you've seen the sort of industry generally move in that direction. so i think there's no doubt that the environment, in totality, sort of capital liquidity controls regulation has led to higher-quality loan books. and so yes, we have been pressure-tested. energy was a 1 in 100-year flood. and i think the industry, and specifically our portfolio, performed really quite well. and that's not to say that there is not a point of pain out there somewhere we just -- that we will not see. we just feel like we'll be in a good position to get through that.
20;32;140;0;0.0;yes. yes, but no. yes, (inaudible). so i would tell you that we are seeing that rotation start. if you go back even 3 years ago, we kind of gave you an outline of what we thought would happen. we said we're going to see rotations from the high wealth segment into investment assets, followed ultimately by the consumer space. we'll see retail deposits move into money funds. we'll see outflows of wholesale, not deposits, as the fed shrinks its balance sheet. but those things are going to play out over the course of the next -- depending on the rate cut, over the course of the next 2 to 4 years. so we've begun to see it. it should be expected. i do not think it tells us anything new or different necessarily at this point.
20;33;98;7;0.07142857142857142;yes. so look, our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong. so when we say moderated, it's from very strong to very strong. and it is in part due to the number of new products we've had. so we would continue -- the sapphire reserve card spend engagement is very strong, and we're very pleased with it. so it's not -- i would not say it's a moderation necessarily. it's just, at these very high levels, from a slightly higher to very strong is still a great story.
20;34;47;3;0.06382978723404255;so if you think about -- our first acquisitions were in august and september. so we're kind of at the early stages. so far, very encouraging. so far, better than our expectations. but a little early to sort of draw firm conclusions on it, but very encouraging.
21;1;353;7;0.019830028328611898;yes, bill, i think -- i've recently been to korea, to australia, in the last 10 days to also southern russia and sochi, but i think essentially in europe, there is a sentiment there that people are beginning to feel that it's not going to get any worse, that there will be some expansion happening as we move forward instead of just purely fiscal restraint and monetary restraint. so there is that feeling beginning to emerge, but i think it's going to be a long recovery. certainly in china, we are seeing the transition happen from a purely export-led economy to one that is more balanced with consumer spending and a combination of consumer spending, as well as export-led a balanced economy. i think there were some challenges in that transition initially where there was a divergence between gdp growth and pure disposable incomes for a while. but i think long-term, that's going to be very beneficial for everyone, this transition in china. i think in general, japan is going to also -- i think the consumer sentiment will continue to be modeled and volatile there and subdued. the rest of the world, whether it's africa, the youngest billion, latin america, eurasia, middle east, we see -- and of course asia, southeast asia and other parts of asia, indian subcontinent, we see growth. we see very disciplined monetary policy, balanced budgets, good banking system, and the consumer is more positive. and so it's modeled and it's mixed. and here in the united states, we see some signs of improvement. we need to wait and evaluate the impact of the payroll taxes, as well as the higher gasoline prices. it's too early to say, but it's a recovery that is at best lukewarm, but we feel that it could get better. that's how we see the world. and based on that, we continue to invest for opportunity. we continue to invest based on our long-term models and plans with our bottling partners, to continue to generate both volume, top line, and income growth.
21;2;11;0;0.0;are you just -- sorry. are you talking about just the restructuring?
21;3;354;10;0.02824858757062147;yes, it's got nothing to do with that at all. think of it as last year we announced a new productivity and reinvestment program that includes continued synergies from our north america ccr, coca-cola refreshment operations, to be able to enable us to continue to invest in our brands to grow in north america. 11 quarters of consecutive quarters of growth. when we first talked about growth in north america back in '09, people thought that we were trying to go to the moon with a glider. and now, it's reality. 11 quarters of consecutive growth. and we intend to continue that. we see this as a growth market. and therefore, to enable us to continue to invest in our brands, this is just ordinary course of business. think about it exactly like that. it's not a big deal, ordinary course of business, and therefore, it's got nothing to do with the united states bottling structure. it's just part of ongoing business and i'll have -- steve cahillane is here with me on this call, as well as ahmet bozer and irial fanin, so i can ask steve to also comment. muhtar, you said it very well. this is very much an effectiveness play. two years ago when we put these businesses together, we had a simple mantra. first, we were going to make it work. then we were going to make it better. then we were going to make it best. we've learned a lot over the course of the last 2.5 years. one of our most successful organizations is our food service organization, which is aligned around three geographic units. we're moving our national retail sales and our field sales organizations also around the same three units, which will really build our total efficiency and effectiveness, our ability to work together, our ability to continue to invest in this market, invest against our brands, put more feet on the street. so we're very excited about the new organization and think it will get us from making it better to making it best.
21;4;332;6;0.018072289156626505;thanks, bill. yes, and i was trying to be pretty clear, but let me be very clear. we expect to hit our long-term growth targets both in 2013 and in long-term. but that applies to 2013 as well. so we're comfortable with that and would expect to be able to deliver that. the second thing is we have always had a mantra that you invest through a crisis. we've been in a global crisis for a number of years now. but we've got history and we've seen what happens when you invest through the crisis, when you come out the other end. as muhtar says, we think -- see things slowly improving across the world, but we expect to come out at the other end much stronger than we were even going in. so we're going to continue to drive efficiencies, productivity, and then reinvest that back to grow the business and growing the brands. the brands are stronger than they have ever been, but we think we can drive it even further so. we're going to continue to invest behind the brands. and just one point to add on that, bill. i always say, as you go up, the air gets thinner. always remember, we're adding on top of significant increases from prior year all the time. just on sparkling beverages alone, we've added 500, over 0.5 billion cases each year. so we are cycling that every year and we're continuing to grow. i think that is really important. and in three years, the worst, i guess, probably macroeconomic environment, we've seen for a long time. we're able to generate volume growth in line with our growth expectations, revenue growth in line with our growth expectations and income growth. generating record revenues of $48 billion, record income, as well as record cash growth. it needs to be taken into that context, continue to crack the calculus for growth.
21;5;391;12;0.030690537084398978;i think in the united states, we are -- as you have heard, we've gained -- continued to gain both volume and value share. and in all over the world, our share is at an all-time high, everywhere across the world, in nartd, as well as in the different categories that we're operating in and competing in. we choose to compete in. and therefore, and similarly in china in sparkling, we've widened our gap to our nearest international competitor in sparkling. in europe, i think there have been a month or two where we've had some challenges. but overall for the whole year, we've, again, gained share across the whole of broader europe, in western europe, as well as eastern europe, and in southeast europe, across the whole continent in both volume and value share. and to be -- i think to be frank, we see competition is healthy, and it keeps us on our toes, it keeps us executing better and being better, becoming more efficient and more productive, and that's all we strive every single day as a business system, together with our 275 bottlers around the world, is that we strive to get better. better at making decisions quicker, so that we can be more nimble and more innovative and, as you know, we've launched more than 800 different products over the last four or five years. many of them are new, innovative products that are gaining great traction, as they are in the united states. look at the still -- performance of our still business. look at the relative performance of our sparkling business. i mentioned that between 2009 and 2012, spend per person on our brands went up from $56 to $60. so transactions are up in the united states. our brand price pack channel location architecture is working in the united states. so both in china, transactions are ahead of our volume, as well as in the united states immediate consumption business. so judge us not only by pure volume. judge us by the quality of our volume and transaction growth. we sell -- in the end, consumers buy packages and products, combination of packages and products, each one at a time. they do not buy liters. that is really important, i think, to understand and how we think about our business.
21;6;187;4;0.0213903743315508;judy, we're actually fully hedged on the yen, euro and sterling, and in fact, the yen positions that we have are actually in the money. they are in good play. that's not an issue. when you look at the first quarter, it was actually -- i said 4%, it was 3% pre-venezuela. it is 4% now. the venezuela devaluation obviously is a big one, when you devalue 50%. so that's number one. but number two, the real impact is not what you would expect, is not the yen. the impact are the rates that we're cycling in the emerging markets, particularly latin america. if you look at brazil, look at mexico, those -- look at the rates at early last year, and then they started devaluing south africa as well. if you look at those, you'll see there's an improving trend. so towards the latter part of 2013, based on where spot is today, we actually turned positive with kind of even to minus one for the full year. but it is front end loaded negative and then improving throughout the year.
21;7;80;0;0.0;we've got a loss on monetary assets. that was the 100 to 125. and so if you look in the wall street journal article this morning, we just joined a list of other companies that have the same issue. so that's kind of a one-time item that i'm just telling you has occurred and will occur. and then the translation impact of the revenues will be about a 1% drag in the first quarter. thank you.
21;8;224;2;0.008928571428571428;john, let me see if i can get the first half of your question. first, below operating income growth, you're right, because we will see net interest flip from interest income to interest expense. there are a couple of things going on in there. primarily, it's rates. and just rates are down, particularly in some of the emerging markets where we've got some cash which was generating a lot of the interest income. you saw that happening during the latter part of this year. and the reason that interest income was actually a lot better than in the fourth quarter than i told you to expect it to be was actually we put on some interest rate swap hedges a couple years ago. there's a small ineffectiveness piece to that hedge and the ineffective piece has to go through the p&l. that was actually pretty large this quarter positive, and it gave us a lot of interest income. so that's part of what you're seeing. so -- but then equity income, you're going to get some leverage. it's going to be up because of the structural items that i talked about from some of the transactions that have occurred. then if we go to, all right, the second half of your question was -- tell me again.
21;9;362;13;0.03591160220994475;well, i think there are a couple of different things. there, i think we're going to see improving and slowly improving trends in many of the markets around the world. europe, i think will improve. my expectation is that europe will improve in 2013 from well -- pretty good improvement form the fourth quarter of 2012, so i would say you're actually going to see sequential improvement in europe. you're going to see sequential improvement in china for sure. i think the us is poised now also in a pretty good place. so i think number one, i think volumes in 2012 dipped a little bit in the fourth quarter. our view is that is not the start of a trend, that we think that's just -- it happened, but it's not the start of a trend. and we would expect volume actually to be okay in 2013 and we think it will sequentially start coming back and be better, be okay in 2013. john, just, just to add on that, i think very little is always said about the 120 or so countries which have a per capita of around 125 in our business, where volume growth for 2012 was, again, 7%. these countries represent about a little more than one third of our total global volume, countries that we never talk about, whether it's sub-sahara, or whether it's in asia or middle east or central asia and so forth. but -- and we grew in these countries 9% in 2010, 7% in 2011, 7% in 2012, and we keep on growing. this is the beauty of our portfolio impact. so while you may have a quarter where china does not grow or where europe does not grow, we still continue to be able to deliver on our long-term growth model for volume and also for revenues, and i think that is -- imagine what would have happened to our volume if europe did grow this past quarter and china. so this is the benefit of having this portfolio, which is getting stronger and bigger, as we continue to invest with our bottling partners in alignment.
21;10;50;1;0.02;yes, john, that's exactly right. when i said hit the target, we hit the target before structural, but then you would have to adjust for structural. but with pretax or net income being the same, it's just what is the geography within the p&l. perfect. thank you.
21;11;295;7;0.023728813559322035;ali, i've always said the fact we are total believers in the franchise system. it is a beautiful system when you can get it to work as we have aligned towards the vision, aligned with its goals and aligned in its ownership objectives and goals. that's what we have. and therefore, we will continue to drive this bottling system towards an aligned vision, which we have. and as i said, we've got three years that we've accomplished that and seven years to go and we're confident that we can continue to accomplish it. as we move through the system, you've already heard us talk about what we see, envisage for the us system, where we have a role again for bottling partners. we are on -- we still have the same time table for that. i will not repeat what the time table was. we said about four to five years since the time we closed the transaction. and you can figure we're still -- we still believe that is doable. and as we move along different parts of the world, you see us creating stronger systems, like brazil, stronger systems like kanto. that is a huge milestone in the 55-year history of our japanese business, getting the four kanto bottlers to unite and to take costs out of the system to be able to continue to invest to drive top line growth for our system. and you will see us doing more of those as we move forward. and again, refranchising philippines is another example. so do not think of this as seismic changes in our bottling system. we will continue to fine tune and evolve as needed, as necessary to drive the goals that we have outlined.
21;12;266;7;0.02631578947368421;first, let me just say that everything we're doing, none of it is reactionary. it's proactive, whether it's brazil, whether it's philippines, whether it's japan, and we've got more to talk about that we're not in a position to talk about right now. all of that is actually proactive. and the us is all about proactive. and i can tell you very clearly, once again, that as i mentioned in judy's question, judge us not only by the leaders, judge us also by the transactions, judge us by how we are doing in terms of the value of the business that we are creating and the consumer spend that's coming into our business, into our brand and the health of our brands. this is ultimately a brand business. our brands are healthier than they have ever been, both in sparkling, as well as in still beverages. so i think that we see -- i repeat, we see opportunities in the united states for it to keep growing and also for us to keep generating value in both sparkling and in still beverages. and that's how we see it and whatever it takes for us to be able -- investment, proactive long-term investment is the key. whatever it takes for us to be able to continue our targeted, thoughtful, purposeful investments, you will see us continuing to do that so that our brands remain healthy, our system remains nimble, and flexible, as far as throughout the market, as far as production and as far as distribution and sales.
21;13;214;2;0.009345794392523364;brian, this is gary. no, no changes at all. we -- you're exactly right. what we announced the beginning of last year in productivity and reinvestment was $550 million to $650 million for total company, including north america. we are still on track. in fact, well on track on that program. it was a 2012 through 2015 program and we are continuing to execute against that. we're on track. we are taking the savings and from the supply chain optimization, the marketing effectiveness, operational excellence, data and it systems standardization were the areas of that whole program, in addition to what we're doing in ccr, and we're taking that and reinvesting behind innovation, as well as marketing of our brands and that's still working well. what we talked about in north america today is just a normal part and evolution of that program and we'll continue to do that around the world to drive effectiveness, because it really helps us in several different ways. it's not only about saving money. it's about operating more effectively so we can operate faster. being more productive means we can make decisions quicker, and those are the things we are driving for. we want to be fast, flexible and very big.
21;14;37;0;0.0;outside of north america, we probably had about $40 million to $50 million in savings in 2012, and then north america continues to drive synergies and did fairly well against their part of their targets as well.
21;15;7;0;0.0;yes, it will be. it will be.
21;16;266;6;0.022556390977443608;let me, brian, answer it this way, because as we continue -- i'll continue to update you on where we are and how big the plan is. so let's call it $550 million to $650 million today, but as you know, a few years ago, we had another program as well that we kind of concluded and then started this one. so we continue to look for efficiencies and effectiveness. but everything we look at when we evaluate it, we would expect that the one-time costs ought to be in a ratio no more than 1 to 1.5 to 1 payback. so you're talking about a 12 to 18-month payback on something that's then continuous benefit to the p&l going forward. okay, great. thanks, brian. thank you, gary, ahmet, steve, irial and jackson. in closing, we had a strong 2012 and have once again delivered quality full-year performance results. our business continues to grow, even in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. our system is aligned. and it's on track to achieve our 2020 vision. together, we are consistently investing in our brands on a global scale through world class marketing and commercial strategy. and as we get closer to the midpoint of our 2020 vision, our system remains resolutely focused on refreshing our consumers, creating value for our customers, maintaining strong partnerships with our bottling partners, strategically investing for the future, and expanding shareholder value. as always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.
22;1;412;3;0.007281553398058253;hi, john. . this is muhtar. first, i think it's important to realize that there's not one model for the world. there's many different models for the world, as you can see. what's happening, this has been an exciting last several months with respect to the evolution, actually continuous evolution, of our franchise system. we manage our business to create sustainable long-term value, and evolution of our franchise system continues to play an absolutely critical role in that process. and so what you have seen recently, the [contal] merger in japan, the brazil merger of three bottling partners creating a large brazilian-led bottling business, the iberian merger of seven bottling partners in iberia, the sale of the philippines -- of the majority shares of the philippines and the control to femsa, and now the us process, the journey starting in the united states, are all part of our vision, our plan, and to ensure that we can continue to deliver on the commitments we've made for our vision. they use, in some cases, they use partially our capital. in some cases, where there's a sale, obviously, we bring back capital back into the coca-cola company, but all the time ensuring that our bottling business is fully suited for the needs of the 21st century, delivering what is necessary ahead of consumer expectations, customer expectations, and so not one size fits all. and in the case of the united states, again i'm pleased to report, we are pleased to report today, that we've reached agreement in principle to start this journey. all along, since the first day we've closed the transaction with coca-cola refreshments, i've always said there will be a meaningful role to invite partners back into the business. when i was -- when we were asked about the timing, we've always said around the four- to five-year timeframe from the time we've closed, the close of the coca-cola refreshments was, as you will recall, back in the latter part of 2010, and we are well within that timeline. and it's a continuous evolution. and sometimes it will necessitate for us to use our own capital, sometimes a mix, and sometimes no capital. and again, not one size fits all. the us model is very different, but it is, again, a model that invites partners to serve with us passionately the communities that we operate in.
22;2;209;4;0.019138755980861243;yes. i think from -- we can not comment on the timing for the end game, but all i can tell you is that we are intent on creating the evolution necessary for us to be able to serve both our large customers and small, independent customers in the best possible way with our bottling partners. again, we've always said that, right from the beginning, and we're consistent to that, that the us will be slightly different. we want to create the best-in-class production, optimum cost production system, coast-to-coast, from the east to the west. that will be nationally managed. we also want to create a nationally managed large customer -- customer management system that will essentially have the responsibility to put together a 21st century customer plans with our large partners in the united states, and at the same time invite partners to come in and be part of this new evolution in the united states. it will take as long as it is necessary. and that is not our focus. it's going to be about doing the right thing as quickly as possible, as efficiently as possible, and as effectively as possible, and that's what we are going to be doing.
22;3;125;0;0.0;bryan, thanks. there are a couple of things to consider. first is, as i mentioned previously in the prepared remarks, that we reversed some compensation accruals in the first quarter. so that gave you more leverage in the quarter, but you will not see that. that's more of a one-time impact, if you will. so it's more leverage in the quarter. the other significant piece is you're going -- the currencies had an impact as well, and currencies moderate going out. but the biggest thing will be geographic mix. and we would expect to see geographic mix changing throughout the year as we go through the year. and as that happens, it will have an impact on gross margin and operating leverage.
22;4;106;3;0.02830188679245283;yes, that's exactly right. and think about north america, actually. i would expect north america, actually in the first quarter of this year, north america's operating income on a recurring kind of comparable basis, was down 3%, and it's down 3% primarily because of two fewer selling days. so if you adjusted for those selling days, it would have been positive. but i would expect north america to actually improve versus where they were, the minus 3%, but as they improved, because it's a finished product business, it's going to have negative gross margin impact, and it'll be reduced leverage.
22;5;32;0;0.0;yes. yes, that's what i was trying to say more in code in the prepared remarks. we normally do not think north america, but that's what it was. thanks, bryan.
22;6;392;4;0.01020408163265306;yes, i think, dara, i think -- this is muhtar, i think that we have not seen anything markedly different from previous quarters as far as the competitive environment is concerned. china remains a very competitive environment. actually the whole world, and again, this is a competitive environment that is a mix of large international companies, but also very much local companies, very much local companies in asia, in parts of africa, in the middle east. we also see a somewhat more rational pricing, particularly in europe, as well as parts of -- other parts of the world, in latin america, too. and i think -- so the way we see the environment is, it will continue to be challenged from a consumer perspective. whether you're talking about asia coming back, or whether you're talking about europe, consumer sentiment in europe, will continue to be volatile and mixed at best. and therefore, pricing is going to be critical, and therefore also ensuring leverage and ensuring productivity can be generated out of operations for us to be able to continue to invest, is going to be critical. but we are intent on continuing to invest in this environment. i'll let steve cahillane talk a little bit about how we manage the pricing environment in the united states (technical difficulties) price mix of 3% in terms of leverage in pricing for sparkling beverages in the past quarter. yes, thanks, muhtar. we would -- we have seen a rational pricing environment in the united states over the course of a good period of time right now. we would expect that to continue, and i've said many times that if commodities go down, do not look for us to reinvest that in price. we've worked very hard to earn the price that we take in the marketplace. we do not have an affordability problem in the united states with our sparkling beverages, and we would look to continue to invest behind our brands. we've got a terrific summer program for the coca-cola brand. we've got an exciting new partnership with taylor swift around diet coke. we'll invest around activating those types of program to continue to focus on our most important objective, which is to continue to support, develop, and drive the sparkling, our sparkling category, inside the united states business.
22;7;277;6;0.021660649819494584;hi, bill. this is muhtar. . i would say to you that this is, again, we're at the beginning of this journey. we have reached agreement in principle with these five us bottling partners. it is very important that we did reach that agreement in principle, and now we can actually ensure that we put all the details into motion, and we can implement effectively. we have always said production is, in the united states, is critical to our success in achieving a optimum cost, 21st century production system, nationally managed coast-to-coast. that is going to take place. we've also said that managing large, 30 or so, of our largest customers in the united states is going to be done nationally. that's also going to take place. in terms of who else would be coming in, we can not comment on that. in terms of what will happen, in what form an architecture production is going to take place in terms of what our current bottlers own, i can not comment on that. all i can tell you, and i can assure you, that we are intent on ensuring that we make the necessary changes in the format and architecture of production to achieve what i just said, which is a coast-to-coast, nationally run production system that generates the efficiencies, synergies, productivities that allow us to continue to win in the marketplace. and again, there may be a future where our partners in the united states take certain ownership in the national production. i would not rule that out also, but it will be managed nationally from one point, single point.
22;8;578;21;0.03633217993079585;okay, judy. i'll have steve answer the first part of your question before gary comes in and sheds some light on the question on profitability. steve? yes. thanks, judy. first quarter clearly had a lot of noise in it. we expected a benefit from easter being in the first quarter. it's never as big a benefit when it comes that early in the year. easter's always better when it comes later in april because of the warmer weather. but obviously you reference the weather. we saw some very dramatic changes. last year we benefited from one of the hottest summers -- sorry, hottest winters, warmest winters in the united states, and we cycled that with one of the coldest winters in the united states. so clearly that had an effect. and we saw any benefit from easter really being washed away, if you like, by the poor weather. there was clearly an effect in the payroll tax. it's a little bit of art and science, trying to pick apart what's weather and what's payroll tax. we would figure about two-thirds is probably weather-related and one-third of the slowdown is based on the economy. we are, though, optimistic, guardedly optimistic, that the consumer is coming back, that the payroll tax and the economy is kind of a short-term, need to get used to the discretionary impact that that has had. so we remain optimistic that we've got the right programs in place, that the economy is on the mend, and we would expect continued good performance as we go out into the next three quarters. in terms of, i guess, questions around profitability, i'll turn that over to gary. yes. judy, i would say a couple of things on profitability. it's really kind of repeating what steve just said. if you take the first quarter and you throw in lousy weather, payroll tax, actually the price of gasoline, what that then does to your immediate consumption versus future consumption business, it's going to have an impact on your profitability. now, if i go back to the answer i gave to bryan earlier, though, when i was talking about geographic mix and it's north america, i would expect north america to be improving, actually, from the first quarter and from where we were. and then north america also has this two fewer days. now, i can tell you, steve's got a number from minus 3%. i said it would have been positive. steve's got a number, but you can calculate it several different ways as to what would the impact of the two days be. we would all agree, i think, it is positive. they would have been positive at the operating income line. but you put all that together, the weather, by the way, as lousy as it's been, and the impact on steve's business, has been given a lot of moisture to the midwest for the drought for the corn crops. so you look for commodities, and we'll see what happens there. payroll tax, consumers hopefully are starting to get used to it. gasoline prices, looks like they are starting to trend downward somewhat. so i think there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic. ccr continues to execute with excellence, continuing to improve capability. so i think there are lots of reasons to be optimistic on north america.
22;9;137;1;0.0072992700729927005;judy, i would actually say the biggest impact on the first quarter for north america was two less selling days, by far, as a whole company as well. but by far, the biggest impact was the two selling days. judy, i did not answer this part. a secondary impact is clearly weather-impacted food service and immediate consumption more than the take-home channel. so we would expect as weather moderates, those profitable parts of our business will start to normalize as well. but, as gary said, two less selling days, when you've got the fixed cost assets that we have in the north american business is really quite significant. those extra two days are golden cases that are going out. and when you lose those two days, it obviously has a big impact. thanks, judy.
22;10;348;7;0.020114942528735632;yes. caroline, i think first in terms of our capability in our system in the united states is i would say the best in the consumer products world in terms of how we go to market and how we can get the product from production facilities. i would like to comment on how we can improve that. if there is a way for us to even improve and generate more productivity, we'll certainly look at it. i think the most important thing, though, is that there is room to generate significant further synergies in production. i think today i would not say that the united states production system, after three years of having integrated coca-cola refreshments, it is where we need it to be. and we need to achieve that -- continue on that road map to proceed towards a modern and best-in-class optimum cost production system coast-to-coast. that will mean, obviously, a lot of changes. that will mean building new plants. that will mean combining some facilities, but i would like to also comment, in terms of hot-fill and aseptic versus sparkling beverage plants, we will look at ensuring that we have the most modern, most productive facilities in place. i do not believe the answer is to combine all under one roof. i think the answer is to combine many that are scattered across the country, both in terms of still and sparkling separately, into some consolidation process, and i can not comment any further. what i can tell you is that there is room for costs to come down. there is room for efficiencies to increase, and we will achieve all of those. this is all in line with our 2020 vision. we laid out a plan when we took over the business of coca-cola enterprises. we laid out a plan when i took over as the ceo back 4.5 years ago, and we are executing it meticulously, and we are doing what we have said we will do, and we're doing it ahead of time.
22;11;326;11;0.03374233128834356;absolutely. i think we can improve service levels. i think we can improve execution inside the point of sale. i think we can improve availability. i think we can improve availability of cold drink. i think we can improve how we serve independents, and all of those things are going to be played out as we implement, execute this new strategy in the united states. and i do not know, steve, do you want to comment? i agree completely. part of what we're doing with this new bottler arrangement focuses on that up and down the street, where bottlers and ccr add the most value, which is not only big customer sales, but up and down the street execution. and we've got also our venture and emerging brands unit, which you're familiar with, which brings brands like zico coconut water, it brought honest tea. so in those spaces that you're talking about, we are very much innovating. we've got glaceau fruitwater, which we just launched to great success a couple of weeks ago. that's being executed, not only in the large stores, but importantly in the up and down the street, food service on-premise accounts as well. we see that as a very important capability. we see ourselves as having a competitive advantage there when it comes to not just shelf space, but cold drink space and overall availability. yes, and just to finally add on to that point, caroline. rest assured, we are in a mode of evolution, rapid evolution, not just in the united states, across the whole world. but, and you will see us adapting, reinventing how we go to market, how we serve customers, and also how we communicate with consumers, very importantly. our brand's at an all time high in terms of health and we will continue, again, to evolve and bring out the best modes of communication with our consumers as well.
22;12;93;3;0.03225806451612903;yes, i think, mark, it's -- i can not -- we can not comment on the details. what we can say is that it will be a model that will align us fully with our bottling partners to do what is right in the marketplace, and to focus on what is right in the marketplace, with full alignment model, and i think i can not just comment any further than that. but you will see us executing better, serving the customers better, with a better production template, as well as a customer service template.
22;13;175;10;0.05714285714285714;i think all of that will come into play, best practices, everywhere around the world. and i am certain that in four or five years time, many people will come into the united states to see the best practices, and as it used to be back in the 1980s when i used to bring bottlers, new bottlers, from eastern europe to see best practice in the united states at that time. in closing, i would like to thank gary, ahmet, steve, irial, and jackson, and to again say that we're pleased with our solid first quarter. we are working as a system to unlock real value, further strengthen execution, and to win at the point of sale. we are confident that a focus, a relentless focus on growth, will enable us to build capable, resilient, optimized, advantaged, and sustainable systems that are well positioned to deliver results in 2013 and achieve our 2020 vision. as always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.
23;1;1602;34;0.02122347066167291;yes, hello, bill, thanks. overall both from -- in europe, united states, india, some other parts, we did have a pretty significant impact from weather -- unusual weather, monsoons coming very early in india as you probably all read, many thousands missing in flooding, worst flooding since the tsunami back 10 years ago. so -- and then europe -- also central europe, germany, all the issues around the river beds rising and flooding and very heavy, wet conditions. so we did, yes, have impact both from a consumer sentiment, both from a mobility sentiment in the united states also, and both also from just the pure, in some cases, distribution issues that hindered our performance and as you know, when we lose a sale that does not recur any more, we lost it that day and so. and also in some cases we were cycling very unusually warm and favorable weather conditions from prior year in some cases like india last year the monsoons actually started later, that gave us a 20% growth in india, unusual for the second quarter in india. usually the first half in india is always less than the second half in india because of the anomalies of the weather. so, yes. and then macro conditions, we all have felt it in social issues in southeast europe, demonstrations across the middle east, and then more recently in brazil, but we feel confident both in terms of looking at our plans in place, looking at current dynamics, that both brazil will have a better second half, china will have a better second half, russia will have a better second half, and certainly a better quarter than this last quarter where we grew volume 3%. overall, mexico as well as india. so while we have -- we continue to invest in our brands, our brands are stronger than ever before, we have taken market share, our system is stronger and so all these key markets we believe will perform better in the second half. in fact, as i've said, we have seen this -- we always know that the second half in a country like india is significantly better than the first half. in any case, if you look back at our performance over last few years. so -- and then in the united states, we've got very robust plans to return back to growth. so we feel pretty confident that this was a confluence of events that happened all at the same time. the portfolio effect of our global business did not work in our favor in this particular case in the second quarter and i feel and my colleagues feel and our bottlers feel very confident. i have been across many markets recently. i've traveled to china, japan, thailand, myanmar, many other parts of asia, i have been in southeast europe, i've been in france, and all in the last four, five weeks and i feel that we will look towards a definitely a better quarter volumetrically, and again, we can talk to you about how we feel about the financial numbers too later in the call and i can ask gary to reflect on that too in terms of the second half. you want to -- gary? sure. well, let me continue on [then] versus the volume. on the second half on the p&l, we had a very solid first half, we would expect to have a solid second half of the year as well. we have said there would be bumps along the road, the industry had one, obviously and it slowed. but we continued to take share and we feel very confident about the second half. as we look at the second half financial results, we will be very close to our long-term growth targets, particularly in volume and earnings per share should be coming back in line with what we would all have been expecting at the first of this year. yes, i would just add, bill, that this is more an anomaly. we should not see this as a trend or a systemic issue and that is simply how i believe one should think about it and again i can ask steve and ahmet to reflect upon how they see the second half from their vantage point in both americas and international. maybe steve, you can start? sure. thanks, muhtar. starting with latin america, muhtar said it well. we saw things in brazil that we hadn't seen before the economy slowed. there was social unrest. it did not last very long, things are slowly getting back to normal, and we expect a better performance sequentially as we progress through the year in brazil and in mexico. in latin center and in south latin, we have seen very good results. high single-digit results continue so there's a lot still going very well that continue to go well in latin america and brazil and mexico, getting back to what we would expect to see on a normal basis. in north america, muhtar said it, it's -- we do not like to talk about the weather, but the first half of last year saw unusually good weather conditions. we had warm weather, we had dry weather coming out of winter and going into spring. this year in north america we had some of the worst weather and you've all seen it. it's been very wet, it's been very cold, it's been historically wet and cold, which obviously impacts our business. on top of that, we had the payroll tax effect which started at the beginning of the year, which affects lower income households, obviously much more, affects their disposable income, their ability to spend. we saw late payroll tax -- late payroll -- or tax refunds coming into the marketplace. but as we look forward we expect the weather pattern to obviously normalize. the weather will not continue to be a factor in a country as big as the united states like it's been and from an economic standpoint, people are used to the payroll tax now. they have had four to five months to moderate their household budgets, to get used to it. the refunds, obviously, have been back in the marketplace and we are already starting to see better trends in qsr, better trends in convenience retail, better trends across our business. so we look forward to the second half of the year across the americas, much more favorably than the first half. muhtar used the word anomaly -- especially an anomaly in north america and we see ourselves coming out of that. ahmet? thanks, steve. thanks, muhtar. yes, just to build further on muhtar's comments, i'll start with india, that's definitely completely weather-related. all our investments in the route to markets coolers and capabilities will continue to deliver the kind of levels that we are used to having from india in the rest of the year. so we are quite comfortable on that. on china, there were probably impacts of -- as you hear, the continuing slowdown in macro levels, as well as there was some weather impact, but we do expect volume to return for a number of reasons. first of all, china is a country with very, very low per capitas. i have been there a number of times in the last three, four months and we have been working on evolving our strategy with better obppc, more price points, and more packs, as well as improving our capability. as muhtar mentioned, we have recently strengthened our management team there, and i'm very confident that in the second half of the year we are going to start returning to growth in china, maybe not at the levels of double-digits that you might have been seeing but we will certainly be looking to returning to growth in china. now, the other anomaly in the international results was europe. i could comfortably say that a very, very big part of that 4% decline was driven by unseasonable weather, as it has already been mentioned. it shows the strength of our system that we were able to gain volume and value share in both sparkling and nartd and as we see weather normalizing we again look forward to coming back to our normal range of growth in europe. the rest of international territory, such as eag continued to deliver at historical growth rates. and bill, this is gary. just add one or two other quick data points as well. when we talk about 1% volume, you have to wonder, is that a weak 1% or a strong 1%. let me just assure you, it's as strong as it can be and still be 1%. so that's number one. the other thing is we talk about some of these anomalies on some of these markets. one of the things that gives me some confidence as well because there's been a lot of discussion about what's happening with the emerging markets and all around the world with the slowdown from china, et cetera, but we have always talked about the markets where the per capita consumption is less than 150 and has always been a real strength of ours. well again even in the second quarter, if you looked at those markets under 150 and exclude china and india, which we have just discussed separately, if you excluded those, our volume in those markets was plus 7% in the second quarter, so it still shows underlying strength of the markets in those emerging markets.
23;2;363;9;0.024793388429752067;yes, john. thanks for the question. here's how i would say it. we are actually very close in the first half of the year, year-to-date, if you look at operating income, i think year-to-date ex structural, currency neutral is plus 5% and our volume is plus 3% so we are not that far away. so our view would be that we should be and in fact year-to-date earnings per share ex currency is 8%, rounds up to 8%. so we are not that far away in the first half. that's why i was saying, solid results, and when i say it's solid -- you've followed us long enough, we like to be at the top end of ranges and not at the bottom end of ranges. unfortunately, we are at the bottom end right now but that's the world we are dealing with but we feel very good about the second half. john, this is muhtar. just one point that i can add to that is the following. it's customary sometimes that when in the kind of businesses that we are in, when you have a blip in your volume because of a confluence of events, some of which are not in your control, the first thing you do is go out and cut marketing and if you look at our numbers, we have continued to invest aggressively in our brands through the second quarter, through -- in the first half and, as you know, every investment in marketing does not pay back in that quarter. it pays back in future quarters and therefore we are confident that with the share gains, we are confident with the strength of our brands, we are confident about the metrics on our brands both in sparkling and stills across the world and we are confident in our bottling partners' investment plans that are taking place in the second quarter that we can continue our momentum going into the second half of the year and also improve on it, volumetrically, but also continue with our mission to achieve our 2020 vision through the next -- the years ahead.
23;3;409;11;0.02689486552567237;okay, john, first i want to compliment you on your creativity with that first question and then here's the real question. but anyway. great question, actually. and the first thing i would say around pricing is we believe strongly that we have premium brands and our brands should command a premium in the market. and they do command a premium across the world. number one, we are seeing pricing across -- rational and within the industry we think pricing is rational, particularly in the united states. but if you look at price mix and i'm going to go year-to-date, but the second quarter is essentially the same thing. if you look at price mix, price mix year-to-date is even. but within that you've got positive pricing and you've got negative geographic mix. so year-to-date consolidated, we actually have positive 1% pricing. if you look at it by region, year-to-date north america has positive pricing up 1%. eurasia and africa has positive pricing up 8%. europe has -- looks like positive pricing up 2%, although i'll tell you a lot of that is because of innocent and our acquisition of innocent so absent innocent, i think europe is closer to flat. latin america is positive 8 points of pricing year-to-date. the pacific is even. and bottling investments group is plus 2% as well. so we are actually getting very nice, positive pricing as well as category mix, brand mix, channel mix, all of those things are working. what's happening to us and where the ding comes in, if you will, is that we've got negative geographic mix so we've got significant negative geographic mix across many of those regions, which brings us back to even when you put price and geography together overall at the consolidated level. as i've often said, geographic mix would -- is always going to be probably negative because you're going to expect those emerging market countries to be growing faster than the developed market countries and you've got better pricing in the developed market countries. what's amplified it a little bit this quarter particularly was the result in europe that we talked about and north america being -- coming out even where they were. so, you put all that together, we are actually getting the kind of pricing we would expect to be getting in the market.
23;4;1354;28;0.0206794682422452;should i take this? yes. judy, let me just reflect on that and i'll ask ahmet also to comment. but what we have said again is there was a coming together of many events that usually do not come together all the time. we have performed overall globally at rates that are much more commensurate to what you've been used to in the last three, four years despite the fact that we've had issues, some of these issues happening to us from quarter to quarter, but you have not felt them because of the fact that the portfolio worked. and this time, you have the issues around in latin america and the two key markets -- brazil and mexico -- on slowing down and on also consumer spending being impacted because of the brazilian crunch in consumer credit that was taken away from the consumers and generally the consumer spending went away. and then you also had china, the issues in china that was consumer spending is actually much below gdp levels and that is documented across the macro numbers in china and as well as the weather issues related to india and also other issues coming together in north america where it went for the first time in 12 quarters from a plus to a negative, which we do not expect. all of these things we do not expect to continue at the same time. some of these things may still continue to impact us. therefore, the portfolio will work. now, related specifically to china, we are participating in two great categories in china and we are the leaders, which is sparkling and juices, those categories we have grown in and they are adding tremendous value to our portfolio and to our business in china. we have also, as we said, retargeting all our efforts in china, refocusing all our efforts. yes, there's a different competitive landscape. we feel that actually that is not -- has not been the issue for us. the main issue for us is to ensure that we can continue to distribute in outlying areas in china that we have had some issues and we are correcting those and also that our marketing is working, which we feel definitely our brands are stronger, our innovation pipeline is working in terms of what we are providing to the consumer, also in terms of packaging. and we feel confident that those two categories -- playing in those two categories -- and then also innovating across some other categories like dairy is going to create the growth and the value for us starting in the second quarter but also continuing and we also feel confident that the chinese leadership -- the new chinese leadership -- are going to ensure that they take the right actions and we are seeing that to reposition and transform the economy without creating a major bump as they transform the economy from a purely export-led economy to a more balanced economy with also consumer spending and both deputy vice premier yang in charge of the economy, as well as the new team, we feel confident and have the plans in place to ensure that that takes place. so again, ahmet, you can reflect more on that, as well as any other markets you want to. yes. thanks, muhtar. thanks, judy, for the question. a couple of messages here, judy. message number one is that the economy may be down but the growth prospects in china, even in the short term, is there simply because of the very low level of per capitas and strength of our system. point number two, if you look at all the competitors in china, nobody really participated in all the categories. all the players have one or two categories that they are strong in and then they drive their businesses through those categories and maybe extend them to others. our position is the same so our strategy is basically first of all, we definitely can do better in the categories that we already exist, such as sparkling. so to give you some specific actions we are taking to do that, i have highlighted the obppc and that's actually accelerated, we have pilots running on various multi-serve and single-serve packages for different price points in different parts of china. and as those things roll out of the pilot, we will be rolling some of them nationally, so those are already in a way in the market and they will be accelerated into the second quarter. we have also relooked at our communication strategies and we are going to be communicating more intensely on the intrinsics of our products as well as extrinsics. you might have heard about our nickname promotion, that's the similar promotion to the share a coke promotion around the world elsewhere, which is getting incredibly positive reaction from the consumer, and all the other things of improving our route-to-markets, et cetera, those are all underway and we are very confident that that's going to give us our strength in sparkling. now we also play in juices as you know, and we, as muhtar mentioned, we are the number one player there. we are refocusing our efforts back around pulpy and we are just looking at an extension of that into mango, which is getting very strong consumer reaction. so as we consolidate our efforts behind that you would see a continued increase. now, obviously we are not only focused on just our existing categories. we have a pretty successful brand in super milky pulpy, which is a value-added dairy, and we are beginning to increase our focus on that and we are getting high single-digit growth of that brand and we are building our innovation pipeline for the future. so it's a fairly robust strategy and, yes, under lower economic environments we might have lower growth rates than what you're used to, but we are ever strengthening our position in china to capitalize on this market for not just immediate future but the very long term. and we have irial also, which oversees bottling investments group and, as you know, we are one of the three system players in china in terms of bottling. maybe, irial, you can comment on what you're seeing down on -- very close to the ground? yes, judy, . just to build on something muhtar said earlier, which is around investment and i would say from a bottling perspective, we continue to invest heavily in the market and particularly in our execution capability, route-to-market capability, and critically in developing the talent to be successful in the next years ahead. so when you add those to the revitalized marketing strategies, obppc, i actually feel very confident about the future. yes, we have bumps along the way but our business is growing, our challenge is to grow a healthy long-term business and i think, from a bottling perspective, we are really putting in place the infrastructure and the capability to really drive a success for the future and that's basically where i would leave it. judy, what i would just say finally is i would not read anything more into this than what it is. as gary said earlier, we were fractionally away from rounding up to 2% and we could -- it would not have been hard for us to do something which would not be right for this business and take the volume up to 3% and selling low, cheap product. that is not what we are about. we are about investing. we are about doing the right thing for this business and we are about -- and i've always said there may be a bump along the road, the one bump along -- we have grown this business consistently in line every year on an annual basis since 2008 on our way to our 2020 vision in the range -- in the upper range of our long-term growth plan despite very, very challenging macroeconomic conditions and that is going to happen in 2013 also.
23;5;239;0;0.0;yes, let me just comment on what you just said. we are not -- this is not about managing on a day -- yes, we manage this business on an hourly basis but it's not healthy to comment on what has happened in the last two weeks. yes, of course, we expect the weather to normalize. as you know, whoever is in the northeast now and whoever was in the west coast of the united states in the last 10 days, you know that weather has -- it does normalize. that's probability and statistics, so it just happened all in a very short period of time where everything was negative in many major markets, it's -- and it will turn -- it will normalize and that's what we are saying, part of what we are saying, so i have every confidence that with the normalized conditions, as i've said, we will again, 2013 will be another year when volume will grow at the range of the long-term growth model. as far as the margins are concerned, i will turn it over to gary in terms of what -- the margin of what you mentioned in terms of the margin numbers in europe. yes, in europe it's a structural anomaly. it's actually innocent. so when the juice business, juice having lower margin, when it came in, that's what changed the margins. it's nothing more than that.
23;6;60;0;0.0;yes. and that's actually the flip side, if you will, of what i said when i was answering john's question, that if you looked at price, the price inside of price mix in europe is actually plus 2%, but it's really innocent giving us a lift on price but it gives the opposite effect on the margin.
23;7;3;0;0.0;yes, exactly right.
23;8;110;1;0.00909090909090909;yes, great question, bryan. well, first, you will see that we did accelerate purchases in the first half of the year. as i said, if our annual target was in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range and we actually have repurchased $2 billion in the first half, we did exactly what you said and we accelerated in the first half of the year. where we are right now is we are sticking with the annual target, which we originally set at $3 billion to $3.5 billion and i'd just tell you, we will give you an update on that at the end of the third quarter.
23;9;9;0;0.0;i've learned to never say never to anything.
23;10;214;5;0.02336448598130841;perhaps, mark, let me take the margin question and then we can come back to the innovation question. but this is actually -- let me get back into actually what i talked about, price mix and margins when i was talking about innocent. the same thing applies actually at a higher level for the total company. so what you've got is very positive pricing and you're seeing that and that being offset by geographic mix. but what you're seeing is when an operation like north america is minus 1% in the quarter, that actually -- this is counterintuitive -- but it actually improves margins, okay, because north america having the finished product business has lower margins. so in our expectation is, number one, to continue to get positive pricing and we are going to be rational in pricing and we intend to stay premium as i said earlier. but in addition to that, we expect north america's performance to improve in the second half of the year, which will actually put pressure on margins, which is why we said earlier that we would expect gross margins to moderate over the second half of the year and it's really the geographic mix of where the income is coming from. does that make sense?
23;11;555;18;0.032432432432432434;yes. yes, also on innovation, as we have said before, we do not look at innovation only as ingredients, we look at it as packaging, ingredients, equipment, even in terms of the marketing, social media, the brand price pack channel, architecture, occasion architecture, all of that is working for us and also our -- in terms of our new campaign to be part of the solution around the world, working closely with local governments, national governments, working with the government of mexico, working with mayors in chicago, in san antonio, other parts of the united states, in different states, in atlanta, and you can look at the patents that we have been filing of recent. so we are working and freestyle and the next generation of what is behind -- what's coming next after that, we are working on a host of new innovations. also ingredients. continue to work with our partnerships across the world in different incubators around the world. the best -- we always believe here in the coca-cola company, the best ideas are outside. so the plant bottle came from the outside from one of the incubators in india. many new ideas are coming from different incubators in israel or in china or in japan or in latin america. we have many -- we have substantial partnerships from here in -- with the university of georgia to across many institutions around the world in techno parks. so, yes, we are very, very active and we are content that we have the right pipeline and maybe i can ask steve to reflect on -- from just a north america and americas perspective. yes, thanks, muhtar. from a -- starting with the latin america perspective, we've got coca-cola light, which we are kicking off in argentina. which we are excited about watching the prospects of that. we are doing terrific innovation around our jugos del valle platform in juices in latin america, as well as in north america we have launched fruitwater, a brand new product off to a very good start. powerade zero drops have joined dasani drops as a very exciting innovation. nos active, with is a fusion between sports drinks and energy, kicked off in april, again off to a very good start. from a packaging perspective, we continue to innovate around our price package architecture. we've just launched 16-ounce sparkling icy cans in our major packages. we've got taylor swift slim cans coming into the marketplace. we've got 19.2 ounce sparkling cans coming into the marketplace. again, lots of excitement around the packaging innovation. in terms of some marketing innovations, we've got coke zero, which is going to be launching college gameday this fall, which we are very excited about. we've got caffeine-free coke zero coming into the marketplace. we feel very good about that. really building out the coke zero platform as an all-day brand, so we've got lots in the marketplace and lots more coming into the marketplace and it builds on one of muhtar's earlier points that throughout this rough period of time, we have continued our marketing pressure, we have continued our marketing investment. we have not cut it. we have increased it and it allows us to continue to innovate and bring new innovations into the marketplace.
23;12;227;3;0.013215859030837005;yes, i would just comment on that that it's all about ensuring that you provide the right choices at the right time for the right consumers in the right environment and that you should not read that we have an increased resolve to use any specific ingredient. it's all about ensuring that we do have viable lights and no-calorie versions for every one of our major brands available to the consumer, ensure that we [front the pack] label transparently, ensure that we have active lifestyle programs, as per all our global commitments, and ensure that we have responsible marketing. that's our -- those are our four commitments and our business, we've said many times, is about brands. today, we have $16 billion brands, that are growing. we have in the pipeline another 19 brands that are bigger than $750 million in revenue and less than $1 billion. those are all going to become $1 billion brands in the next increment of time because they are growing and we are confident that we will have multiple -- more $1 billion brands than we have today and i think that's what this business is all about, adding value through brands to our system and i'm confident that you will see us add many more $1 billion brands to our [rostrum] in the near future.
23;13;802;22;0.02743142144638404;steve, you want to go? yes, thanks, ali. i will start. in terms of pricing, we have always said that our pricing strategy in north america is consumer-based and it continues to be consumer-based. we captured, if you look at nielsen, we captured very good pricing across our portfolio in north america and we think it was an appropriate amount of pricing by channel. the unfortunate 4% volume decline was, as we said, had a lot more to do with weather and the economy, at least 60% to 70% having to do with a one-time, really poor weather event, so we did not put more price in the marketplace to try and chase volume that was not there. we put appropriate price increases in the marketplace and we maintained our margins and we maintained our price strategy going forward and we continue to bring new products and new packages into the marketplace to help our whole architecture achieve the type of pricing that we deserve. and we have given some examples of this in the past and a good one is our 1.25 liter, which continues to be very successful. one-third of the 1.25 liter volume is in fact incremental volume, so it is good in and of itself but it has also allowed it -- so if you look at our 2-liter pricing over the course of the past 12, 15 months, we are out of the $0.99 price promotion for 2-liter and have been for quite some time. so we are not going to put too much price in the marketplace. we take appropriate price, based on what the consumer and what's right for the consumer and what's right for the customer and we fully expect that based on the price plans we have in place for the back half of the year, based on the innovations we have on the back half of the year, that sparkling volume will in fact improve from what happened in the second quarter. ali, i would move onto your question on china. the answer is there's absolutely no plans for increased price promotion. in fact, the reason for having a evolving obbpc is to have more sustained volume at the right price point and the right packs for all the consumers. now, to give you an example, you might be familiar that there's been a lot of upsizing going on in china and we have launched our 300 ml package last year. now, we will tactically respond to such upsizing to be able to balance our volume and share performance but that's a -- those are limited tactical moves rather than a strategy to have increased price promotion so that's not really in the cards. now, to maybe build on this a little bit and also to address some of the innovation questions that i did not have a chance to share, is that we have small cans -- either slim can or sleek can -- and small pet launches all across the international territory, all across europe, all across eurasia africa group, and some of the pacific markets. that i believe is an important innovation in a way and also allows us to drive revenue and gross margin. in addition to that, let's also keep in mind that we had some very successful products such as pulpy that has not been fully launched in all of our international territories. eurasia africa group, for example, have taken that and they have launched it in morocco. in a very short period of time, we were able to achieve a 20% plus market share with that launch. we've just had a recent launch of extensions of coffee into pet in japan. in the cvs channel, the recruiting female consumers were quite happy and pleased with the results of that. we have been innovating in energy drinks in russia and turkey by extending them into pet packages, resealable pet packages that the consumers want so we continue to innovate in different packages, different categories across our international territory as well as using successful innovations from the previous years. thank you, jackson, irial, steve, amit, and gary. our business continues to grow and to capture global volume and value share even in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges and importantly we do not manage our business for the short term but rather for the medium and long-term and, as i mentioned earlier, our focus on achieving our 2020 vision is unwavering with current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the back half of this year and beyond. as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.
24;1;0;0;NA; .
24;2;443;5;0.011286681715575621;yes, dara, . i think first it's important to realize that there is different timing across the world to some of the volatility and macroeconomics, and particularly what's interesting for us which is disposable incomes. so i think china has already had a slowdown and is beginning to recover. we see that. and there's always also a lag between the gdp per capitas and disposable income. so also important to realize that they do not all happen at the same time. the numbers do not correspond to each other one-to-one. and so we do see an improvement in southeast asia and parts of certainly china, where things have stabilized and things, people are beginning to normalize their habits. and in the last three, four months we've seen a flight of currency from emerging markets, market stock exchanges in countries back into north america. that's had impact on disposable incomes in latin america, in eurasia, in countries like turkey, and other countries, in certain other countries in north africa. so, yes, those -- and you can track stock exchange indexes and you can track disposable income growth or slowdowns. they are all very related and we do see that the world is not just one city or one element of volatility. there's different pockets of volatility happening at the same time. and what is, what we are fortunate with is the great portfolio, a wonderful portfolio where india slowed down maybe seven, eight, nine months ago. we see some comeback in terms of disposable income i'm talking about, and china is the same. southeast asia i would say are similar. philippines also pretty much in that camp. and then we certainly also see that we've still got some headwinds maybe in other parts of the world. so there's some tailwinds coming and some headwinds coming. and we continue to invest in our brands and when you look at our performance, we have sequential improvement in many parts of the world, particularly when you look at places like india, places like china, atayan, even also developed markets such as australia and also south africa. and our african continent, i have not mentioned that, countries that are some sub-south africa that are usually south of 80 per capita, again, grew in a very healthy manner this past quarter, about 5% up. and we expect africa to continue to generate good results and economies in africa seem to be pretty buoyant and seem not to be too impacted. but of course they are very slow level of their per capita development as well. i hope that helps.
24;3;104;1;0.009615384615384616;i thinks it's pretty -- as i said, different pockets showing different results, but we have a very, very sharp focus on -- i was down in latin america recently a month ago. i visited many countries in africa recently as well as in asia. we have an incredibly sharp focus on brand price pack channel architecture, new price points, lower price points, more focus on affordability, more focus on returnable packs and smaller packs. individual packs that help continue to keep the drinkers' base growing, which is key and essential to when economies also start turning up and when disposable income starts heading north.
24;4;0;0;NA; .
24;5;1118;14;0.012522361359570662;yes, thanks, bill. first, philosophically, from a strategic vantage point, the whole story of balanced growth we believe is still very impact. balance being growth in western markets, growth in emerging markets, balance being growth in sparkling and growth in still beverages. and you see that happening in this past quarter as well. so we've grown in markets like the united states, which we believe is a long-term growth market. when you think about it, 14 of the last -- of the last 14 consecutive quarters, we've grown in all but one of them. and now we've generated, again, 2% growth, with 2% growth of brand coca-cola. so we -- australia grew. many important markets in western europe grew. germany grew again 3%. countries in northwest europe generated good healthy growth for us. and then emerging markets. yes, there's some headwinds that are happening in emerging markets but we believe they are very temporary. the whole demographic, the whole investment, the whole story of 1 billion new middle class still holds very strong in our opinion by 2020. over this past decade that we're in, this decade that we're in, a billion new middle class. that bodes very well for the industry we're in and we believe we can continue to generate very healthy good growth. we believe we can continue to generate very healthy price earnings. i mean, i'm sorry, price mix. and we believe that, therefore, in this, like in this past quarter which was where we did see a lot of headwinds, we generated 4% revenue growth and 8% currency-neutral operating income growth. and we believe that we had a lot of headwinds. so as economies begin to move, i think we'll see a lot of improvement. and i'll ask ahmet as well to make some comments on this and if need be also ask steve to add his commentary. thank you, muhtar. bill, you mentioned a few items. i'll just focus on a couple of them. emerging markets, as you know, if you look at the history that it goes through cycles. so it has a cycle of years and years of growth and every now and then you have economic headwind, and you manage through that. but emerging growth, emerging markets growth economically certainly is not over, and we have a formula which pretty much closely shows that as personal consumption grows, we actually grow with it. now, having said that, in some of the emerging markets where there might be personal consumption and macro headwinds, we could still grow, like india, because we have very low per caps and we have significant investments in feet on the street, infrastructure, brands. we're just really building our business. and india showed that again this year. so that's what i would say about your comment of emerging markets. the growth story there is far from over for a long time to come. and i guess the rest were about us pricing and decline in soft drinks. so maybe i should just pass that on to steve. yes. thanks, ahmet. first, i would just underscore on the broader question, what muhtar said in his prepared remarks, that in this quarter we delivered the highest number of servings ever reported in the third quarter. so i think that bodes well for our growth story going forward. but with regards to north america pricing, which i heard you ask, bill, and in particular, sparkling price. we feel good about delivering positive price mix in the quarter of plus 1%, in line with our strategy to consistently earn at least 1 to 2 points of sparkling with consumers. and in the us coke system remains committed to taking rational pricing and we've done this very well over the past several years. in fact, we achieved 2 to 3 points of price mix in sparkling beverages and across our total portfolio in both 2011 and 2012. year-to-date, we're 2% sparkling price mix, which we feel good about. but i think it's important to remember, we've always said that we're going to focus on consumer-centric pricing. and if i can give you an example of that, the average price today of an 8-ounce serving of coca-cola is $0.25, exactly $0.25. this is up over 5% versus two years ago and it's up nearly 10% versus three years ago, which compares very favorably to the us inflation market. and this tells me really three things. first, at $0.25 we do not have an affordability issue. coca-cola remains a very affordable indulgence. two, we've been able to earn price above inflation in the united states. and three, we still have plenty of room to continue to take price. but now addressing the third quarter in particular, we acknowledge we did strategically invest in select promotional activity in the back half of the summer through the labor day holiday. given that we essentially did not have much of a fourth of july holiday and memorial day holiday, this labor day acted much more like a fourth of july holiday. but these investments were tied to specific occasion-based brands and packages to help drive incremental household penetration, which they did, attract more consumers into the category, which happened, and is very much in line with our long-standing north american strategy. and all of these activities that we did, all of them, to take price in the marketplace, i think set us up very well to take more price in this quarter and going into 2014. so we're very confident that the pricing environment in north america remains very rational and that we'll be able to continue to earn price in the marketplace in this quarter and going forward in the next year. yes, just let me round out that question with one final remark, bill, and that is that once again if you take our world average per capita of around 90, just under 90, and you take the most populous nations of the world that are less than half of that per capita, india, china, indonesia. way below that number, way below half of that number, we believe there's -- and many other parts of the world as well in africa, the youngest billion, we believe the critics, whoever they are, are wrong. i do not understand that sentiment. we're growing while others are not at the moment. and our business and balanced portfolio is built for times like these. so we see this as a time of opportunity.
24;6;0;0;NA; .
24;7;195;2;0.010256410256410256;yes. look, bryan, firstly let me just address that by saying regressive taxes do not work, period. and wherever we have seen them being implemented in some cases, they have been taken away by the government after two, three years, basically like in denmark. they are not working wherever else they have been implemented, and so the consumer suffers in them. it's proven time and time after again. we've made our case to the government. we have tremendous respect for the government of president pena niento. and we need to understand that, and we've made our case that this really does not have anything to do with health policy. in order to address the health policy properly, we have to come and work together with government and with civil society to raise the awareness and to create programs that really work. that really drive physical activity and, therefore, just a regressive discriminatory tax on one part of the food industry just is not going to work and apparently that's all i would really like to say, because its discussions are in progress and i do not want to comment any further.
24;8;126;2;0.015873015873015872;i just do not want to comment on it at this moment. as i said, there are a lot of discussions going on and it would be wrong for me to publicly comment on any of those discussions and, therefore, we'll deal with whatever the result is in the most effective way. i can assure you that we will continue to prosper the business. we're one of the largest, we are the largest consumer goods business in the country. we are one of the largest contributors to the gdp in that country by a big margin, and we support millions of retailers in the country effectively for their livelihood and, therefore, i think that we will certainly find the right way forward, whatever happens.
24;9;552;10;0.018115942028985508;okay, john. let me see how well i can do on this and then you can come back and ask. but first, going to price mix, and just as a reprise in general on price mix, generally what we see, and i'm going to take this in steps, generally what we see is you see pricing. so you see rate and mix, positive rate and mix, would be positive across almost all of the groups. you would then see negative, generally, you would see negative geographic mix and it's basically a function of higher growth in emerging market countries than developed market countries, which would give you a negative geographic mix. then on top of that, and you're absolutely right, then where we own bottlers and they're growing, and that gives you then a positive price mix because they're finished products versus concentrate. so a couple things. so if you go back to the second quarter, i talked about margins and i thought margins would moderate and because of geographic mix. and the follow-up to questions i remember, i said because we expect north america to actually perform better and that will actually hurt margins because it's a finished product business where margins are lower. but it helps price mix. and what you're seeing today is while price mix in north america was even for the quarter, we are getting positive price mix from our finished product businesses. going forward, and not talking specifically about 2014 because we're still in the midst of planning 2014 and we'll give you a full review on our views on next year in the february call, we are planning to take appropriate pricing and steve referred to taking pricing in north america as well. so we are expecting to take pricing. so going forward, what i would expect to see is that we should have a positive in rate going forward. we should have a positive in mix going forward. we should have a positive from finished products going forward. and we should have a negative from geographic mix. so that's the kind of -- and if you add all of that up, it should be a positive price mix. that's what we would expect and it's what we would expect as what's in our long-term earnings road model, is positive price mix long term. now, let me see if i can turn to operating income. when i was talking about operating income, it was definitely currency-neutral. it was -- and ex structural. so let's be very clear on both of those, currency-neutral and ex structural so operating income was 8% currency-neutral ex structural for the quarter, and 6% year-to-date currency-neutral ex structural. and what i said was we now expect the full year to be generally in line with the first half of the year. so somewhere in that ball park and that is net of currency-neutral and net of the structural impact because i can tell you with the structural impact, it's a point of negative structural impact and so that would take our year-to-date from 6% to 5%, for example. so just to be clear, ex structural, currency-neutral.
24;10;38;0;0.0;yes, without giving guidance, what we're basically saying is that the full year we think ex structural and ex currency, it ought to be in line pretty much with where we are year-to-date. yes. okay.
24;11;341;7;0.020527859237536656;yes, steve, you want to address that? yes, thanks, judy. first, i did talk specifically about diets. i would underscore that we have a very wide portfolio in north america led by brand coca-cola, which is twice the size of diet coke, and brand coca-cola, as you know, grew 2% in the quarter which we're very pleased with. diet coke is like a lot of diet products in the united states, and not just beverages but across the whole array of food, are under a bit of pressure as people are questioning ingredients, ingredient safety, and so forth. but we believe very strongly in the future of diet coke, the number two sparkling brand in the united states. we've got terrific programs against it. we're actually seeing increased incidents in the past quarter, between 19- and 24-year olds. we think a lot of that has to do with the exciting new promotions with taylor swift, some of the new packaging we're bringing into the marketplace, an increased focus on diet coke. but there are headwinds. there are headwinds that we're facing. and we face headwinds in a lot of different areas, a lot of different places, and this is just one of them. but last year it became the second best selling sparkling in the united states and we're continuing to focus on it. coke zero, also a part of our zero-calorie portfolio, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. so we're very happy about that. we've got a great program around coke zero, college gameday just kicked off, it's really becoming ever-more relevant with young males. so we're confident that throughout our whole portfolio, we're offering consumers exactly what they want, when they want it, how they want it, at the right prices that they want it, and we'll continue to focus on any of the headwinds around diet coke. and we're confident that it has a bright future in this country.
24;12;390;14;0.035897435897435895;well, judy this, is muhtar. first, i think it's important to understand that, and i've said this in the past, that economies that are performing at a different pace in the continent of europe, not everywhere is really bad, not everywhere is really good. and so you still have very challenging consumer sentiments in spain and italy and greece and portugal and the south, in southeast europe, in what used to be termed as the balkans, romania, bulgaria, former yugoslavia. it's very challenging environment. and then you've got a better environment in northwest europe and then certainly the best environment still in germany. and so based on those, our business also reflects some of those conditions and so it's a pretty good mirror actually. and i'll ask irial to comment on germany and why we've been consistently performing in germany and growing our business and, again, there is tremendous sequential improvement versus the first half in many countries of northwest europe, in scandinavia and also northwest european countries. irial? thanks, muhtar. and this actually goes back to one of the earlier questions. i think in germany we've got an economy that's doing okay. we have got actually really good marketing married up with continued excellent execution. and you bring all of that together and you get great results. and for me in germany, it gives me great confidence about the future of our business, quite frankly, because we are seeing where we put in the hard work, where we do the right things in the business, we do get good results. and germany is just an example of what can happen, quite frankly, in many markets around the world as the economies turn and improve. ahmet, do you want to comment? yes, i just wanted to -- hello, judy. i just wanted to add to the others that we had a very, very strong share a coke campaign across europe this summer that worked extremely well. we are ever-more closely aligned with our bottling partners, really driving growth. and just on the macro, i would like to add that there's a clear divergence between north and south. so north continues to do better and south continues to do worse. so our business in the north certainly is reflective of that.
24;13;0;0;NA; .
24;14;177;8;0.04519774011299435;yes, i think it's on target, as we have said, reported previously, where we make very sound significant good progress with, in discussions with some of our existing partners, as well as discussions ongoing with some other prospective partners. so we are on target, if not a little bit ahead. and i think you'll hear more about it in the coming period ahead of us, and i'll ask steve just to maybe shed some more light on it. yes, thanks, muhtar. bill, the one thing i would really underscore is we absolutely have not hit a lull. do not take the absence of public commentary to mean that we are not making very good, very constructive progress. all our bottling partners, both current and prospective, are extremely excited about this business in the united states, about the opportunity to continue to be franchise partners in the united states, to grow the business in the united states, and we're making very exciting progress and we'll have more to report in the coming months.
24;15;324;7;0.021604938271604937;talking about productivity, bill? i'll ask gary, do you want --? sure, bill. within the quarter, we continue to invest in marketing, so marketing is actually up in the quarter and up year-to-date. we had significant productivity savings in the quarter. we have some previously announced productivity programs that we announced back in 2012. those 2012 programs will go through 2015, and really focus around productivity and then reinvesting those back into the business. they were focused on information systems, marketing, supply chain, innovation, operational excellence, that sort of thing. i can tell you, we'll give you a full update on it at the year-end call, so i can give you the full year. but we are making very good progress against the goals and you'll see that on the february call when we go through a full update. and we've got hard savings and soft savings. so let me give you some examples of what's happening and it's adding into the productivity and some of the leverage that you're seeing. so in things like supply chain, if you buy things cheaper, hard savings. and we're doing a lot around supply chain and actually getting a lot of hard savings. and those you're seeing being reflected. in marketing, if you can buy media cheaper, then we just buy more media basically is what we're doing. so we're reinvesting back into marketing and being able to buy more media for the same price, if you will. so we, as i say, we'll give you a full update on all the productivity programs in february at our year-end call. but we're making excellent progress and you're seeing a lot of that just what's coming through the g&a line with, as i say, within that marketing, sg&a marketing, being up for the quarter and year-to-date.
24;16;43;0;0.0;very, very little. there's a huge cycling of last year in the fourth quarter, as i've mentioned earlier. but there's very little. i mean, there's a little bit but nothing of significance in the quarter this year. thank you.
24;17;261;3;0.011494252873563218;yes, thanks, ali. i think that's a fair interpretation of what i said. this was a very different summer. it's been a difficult year starting with the fiscal cliff and sequestration and payroll taxes and so forth. and then the summer was very sluggish and it's very important in our business to keep consumers engaged with our brands, to make sure that we're in the households, to make sure that teens are being recruited. and so labor day acted very much like a fourth of july or memorial day, whereas typically it would not. it would be the end of summer. and labor day acted like the only summer, so it was more promotional than you would have seen. it would be more promotional than what we would expect going forward. but those things happen from time to time. and we think that the pricing environment will continue to be very strong, very rational, and because of all the investments we're making in our brands, we feel that we have the opportunity to earn even more price going forward in the marketplace. and that would be absolutely our intention to do that. and i just want to add one thing. in terms of the nielsen data, yes, that's exactly the reflection. but do not underestimate. we took very healthy pricing and i see also in the quarter. and so, overall, that's how you get to the one price mix positive on sparkling. and so, do not let that point go unnoticed at the moment.
24;18;130;2;0.015384615384615385;i would say that first, we believe that our long-term growth model, with appropriate mix which we believe we can take and we can generate, it would definitely get us to our 2020 vision of, from a system revenue point of view, of doubling our business with the base of 2010. so that's the sort of trajectory, if you like, and we're on track in terms of moving ahead to doing, achieving our goal. the second piece is we'll always be looking for any kind of bolt-on acquisitions that may make sense, but that's the extent of what i would say that right now we would be looking at. bolt-on acquisitions and if there's an opportunity, we will look at it seriously.
24;19;4;0;0.0;sorry, say that again?
24;20;39;1;0.02564102564102564;i do not think materially. you know, if you look at our long-term growth of corridor of volume plus what we've been achieving, i think the balance is still there the same as it used to be.
24;21;554;12;0.021660649819494584;yes, i'll have ahmet just comment on china. then maybe gary can finish off the second part of the question. sure. thanks, wendy. you might remember that in our last call, we talked about the fact that we were evolving both our organization and our strategy in china. and what we see in the third quarter really encourages us that we had not only 9% growth in total, but also 8% growth in sparkling. and that's pretty much delivers on the expectation that we've said that we would expect sequential improvement from the first half results, in the second half of this year, and we expect that sequential improvement from the first half results to continue into 2014. to your question of pricing promotion, we did not have any significant marked pricing promotions in the marketplace. it was basically a combination of, a, beginning to implement parts of our new strategy in the marketplace, b, the same share a coke promotion as we're scaling up these wonderful global assets in all parts of the world. and then our new team beginning to gel together, connecting with our bottling system and really improving execution. so we are encouraged by those results and we expect to continue to, as i said, improve sequentially from the first half results. okay, gary. yes, wendy, relative to share repurchase, let me first, let me just start with a preface that do not particularly agree with you on saying our share price is relatively underperformed for the last two years. but absent that, a couple of thoughts on share repurchase. our view on share repurchase is that share repurchase is value neutral. it is not something that grows value. it does for the short-term holder. because maybe you can get a bump in the share price. but for the long-term holder, it is not something that is value-enhancing. it is much more like a cash-efficient dividend, which is the way we treat it in that our priorities for cash are number one, to reinvest in the business, to grow the business that would include bolt-on acquisitions, et cetera. number two would be dividends which we have increased for the last 51 years, 10% this year. and third, excess cash would be put into share repurchase and just because we do not need that cash in the business. so it's a return of cash to shareholders. but leveraging the balance sheet to do something that we would view as value-neutral, we do not think is the right thing to do so we continue to just perform exactly in line with the targets that we set at the beginning of the year. thanks. thank you gary, ahmet, steve, irial, and jackson. we delivered sound third-quarter results within an ongoing challenged macroeconomic environment. while we saw sequential improvement in the business, we remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on further advancing our growth trajectory. our 2020 vision and long-term strategies remain firmly intact. and together with our global bottling partners, we're investing in our brands and our capabilities to further strengthen our system and to drive sustainable growth and value. as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.
25;1;1464;34;0.023224043715846996;sure, bill. . this is muhtar. let me first just take a step back and just say that, in a way, we've had a speed bump. we know it would have come on our road to 2020. we dealt with commodities and in 2011 and 2012. volatility in weather has become a norm. uncertain economies -- internal, also execution issues caused us to under-perform versus our expectations in 2013. i'll start by saying that. we have looked at everything. we have looked at our people, priorities, marketing, selling, and innovation, and we have refreshed our plans with a simple but scaled up set of priorities on marketing our brands, system execution by our franchisees and bottling partners and company-owned bottlers, and on innovation of all kinds. business models like the one that we recently announced with green mountain, brands, equipment, packaging, the lot. our long-term outlook is our performance algorithm which we have and will deliver going forward. and 2014 will be a year of steady improvement as we get back up to speed. but make no mistake, our leadership team is confident, accountable. our system will market well. we will sell well and we are going to achieve our 2020 vision. now let me just take you through a quick tour of the world and i'll ask ahmet also to comment. starting with asia, china is going to sustain its growth, india in terms of its macroeconomic outlook, and we will continue to benefit from that. in india, there is elections coming up and usually when there are elections, there is a little bit of easing of fiscal discipline. that will play into a little bit of added disposable incomes. in southeast asia, certainly we've seen quite a lot of political turmoil, especially in thailand. that will -- as we go into 2014, my expectation is that, that will ease a little bit. indonesia, also there's an election coming up. but indonesia is certainly having some macroeconomic issues that will probably continue into 2014. philippines, we'll see a slightly improved outlook in the philippines versus 2013. in japan, obviously everyone is looking very closely at the new policies of prime minister abe's government. there's a new tax coming up. we'll see how that impacts but certainly we all feel -- that our operating in japan -- feel that there is some hope for a little bit of more inflation in the economy that will benefit also businesses like ours. although recently, the last economic numbers from japan were a little bit below expectations. africa, youngest continent, we're very well-positioned. we feel that we will continue to grow well in the years to come in the african continent and benefit from also improvements in governance across the whole continent. in eurasia, there's elections coming up in turkey. lots of again political issues in the middle east will continue. russia, all russians can be very proud of the olympics that are taking place. we will as we move forward -- and i was there in russia, looking at some of the great activations that we've had in our business -- and russia, our business will continue to grow in russia with all the investments that we're making with our bottling partners. europe is a continued tale of two cities. if you take the southern zone, the high unemployment and low growth is going to continue but it's not going to get worse. as far as northern europe, britain is certainly ahead of all the other economies in terms of the growth outlook. germany also is in that area. we will continue to benefit from the robustness of policies in those two economies and the rest of the continent is somewhat behind germany and england. in latin america, again, 2014 is going to be a year leading into an election in early 2015. we'll have also the benefit of the world cup and our biggest ever activation globally on the world cup. southern cone -- argentina, chile -- we should continue to see the benefit of all the programs we have in place and also continued inflationary environment in those two areas. mexico, president pena nieto's programs are taking effect, all the reforms. long-term, that is a benefit to our business, to the economy, to the people of mexico. again, as i said in my commentary, it's too early to say about the impact of the price increase we've had there. so i hope that gives you a good tour of the world. then finally, in terms of our flagship market in the united states, clearly the best right now, as far as we can see -- the best western developed economy in the world, we think we will see slightly improved mobility in the united states in 2014 versus 2013. we hope that, that will also mean a little bit of increased spending for consumer products as we go into 2014. so -- and again, we will benefit from all the robustness in our marketing programs and our increased expenditure and quality of marketing as we move into 2014 for our flagship market. ahmet, do you want to add some commentary? yes, i'll add a few things to really compare some of these issues that have existed even last year, how they are different now. so for example emerging market currencies, when the first news on discontinuation of tapering came out last year around may or june, there was a bit of a shock in emerging markets. we see that over the last seven or eight months, these emerging markets are finding ways to deal with it -- by no means it's certain, by no means it's perfect -- but it certainly feels a little bit more under control compared to when it first came up, and the interest rate and things like that have been baked into those expectations. so the message there is countries and our business, we are finding ways to deal with that new reality of less liquidity coming out of the united states. i would just add, muhtar, to your comment on europe north-south divide, that is very much true but we are beginning to see different shades of gray in the south as well. there are some encouraging signs in spain SEMICOLON less so in italy at this point in time, although there's a new prime minister there and we're hopeful with the new programs to be announced if they are. and eastern europe -- it continues to struggle in terms of consumer confidence and economics. so north continues to do well and south is even showing different performance now. the other point that, muhtar, you mentioned, is political uncertainty. it's another common theme to many of our emerging markets. they eventually could impact the economic realities, but again, so far, in countries like turkey and thailand, it's been fine. and let me, just, in the interest of giving time to other questions, let me just stop it here. sandy, do you want to add any commentary to north america? it's important to say in north america that we believe in the north american market SEMICOLON we believe in the demographics SEMICOLON we believe this is a growth market. we have grown in all but 2 quarters of the last 15 quarters in the united states. we believe we can do better and we're intent and resolutely focused on achieving that. sandy? thanks, muhtar. we have a great business in north america. our focus in accelerating the business is on our brands, on our customers, and on our capability. i'm really happy to be working with irial and paul and all of our us bottlers. irial finan and paul bring a tremendous amount of selling and executional energy that will help us build on our momentum. on my end, over the last 6 to 7 weeks, paul and i have met with our major customers, we've met with our bottlers, and we've gone through the brand plans in detail looking at opportunities to focus and strengthen them and to move resources to emphasize advertising and brand-building on our largest brands. with the plan in place, our focus as a system -- irial, paul, and i, and our bottlers -- is to improve all aspects of our execution whether it's marketing or sales or in the marketplace. we believe as a result of that, that we will improve steadily over time, and we share the confidence that muhtar expressed in the long-term health of north america. it's a great market, it will grow, and i think we can be confident about our long-term future there.
25;2;256;2;0.0078125;bryan, thanks, and let me see if i can go through all of those. let me start at the top. when you're the industry leader, you have to believe in rational pricing and we believe we should get pricing for our brands because our brands are worth it and we would expect to have positive price mix this year to go with the volume that we will have this year. when you look at commodities, they're fairly benign from what we're seeing for 2014 so not a big deal. now let's say currency, among the worst we've seen in years. there's not a whole lot you can do about it when all the emerging market currencies melt down as they did earlier at the end of december, early january. with that said, let me be very clear. ours is a growth business, is a business model that is built on growth, and we know that we can not save our way to prosperity. we will have productivity, but that productivity will be reinvested for growth. while we are reinvesting for growth in our marketing, we have -- our goals are also, in addition, while we're increasing the marketing, we will also have a goal and it is the goal for this year of hitting our long-term growth models this year. so we're going to significantly increase our marketing but at the same time the goal is we will hit long-term growth model this year. right. thank you.
25;3;278;5;0.017985611510791366;john, this is gary. thanks for the question. first, as muhtar said in the prepared remarks, it's too early to tell what's going to happen in mexico. we have planned around mexico of what we believe is the most likely case, but we have a portfolio of brands that are marketed and sold across 200 countries, and our job is to manage that portfolio. so unless something unforeseen should happen, the answer has to be yes. it includes what could happen in mexico. if that changes, we'll update you obviously, but we're going on what we believe would happened today. and just to add to gary's answer and to the second part of your question, john, i'll just tell you very simply that the coca-cola way is to grow our way to success. we invest for growth together with our bottling partners and we have the greatest system in the world. we have a tremendous amount of experience to say that good marketing, good selling works for our business. and it will work for our business. we have numerous cases to prove that. we're going to continue to build on our marketing in both quantity and quality. this is a global increase in marketing. in every country that we operate in, large or small, we know it works. when we invest in marketing, our global partners invest in feet-on-the-street, in more coolers, in more trucks, in more [lines], and that's what we see happening. that's what we will see, we believe, happening to our business as we restore steady momentum in through 2014 and beyond.
25;4;317;5;0.015772870662460567;judy, it's gary. let me take the first part of that question on the fourth-quarter operating profit declined was down 12% in the fourth quarter. by the way, i know the answer to this one specifically because i asked the same question some time back and got into the minute detail on it. 100% of that change is because it's in all in opex, or primarily all in opex and it's what we're cycling from 2012. there were some incentive compensation accrual reversals in the fourth quarter of 2012 that did not happen in 2013. that cycling caused a significant change in opex swing year-on-year in the fourth quarter only and it's what swung north america to that 12% operating income loss. so it's much more reasonable to actually look at north america, look at it for the full year, and you'll get a better picture of actual performance versus the fourth quarter. when you look at the full year, then you will see that is where we've got some challenges, as muhtar said, around volume and particularly in sparkling -- around diets and lights. but that's what we're specifically on. yes, just let me add to in terms of the outlook, and that is that, as i said, we are confident about and excited about, first, our performance our algorithm worldwide. but also in terms of steady improvement as we get back up to speed in the united states and that will -- when we start restoring the momentum in the united states, which we believe is going to happen, that will also bring the financial results that we will be happier with as we move into 2014 and beyond. it's going to take a while. this is not an immediate fix but we know that it's going to be a steady improvement.
25;5;62;2;0.03225806451612903;can not give you the specifics on the geographic mix, judy, but as we announced, it's about $1 billion by 2016. and it is a global number. again, there will be a good distribution. we will be again also looking and tracking through franchise leadership, resulting also system increase in investment in all the key markets. yes. see you friday. thanks.
25;6;309;7;0.022653721682847898;thanks, dara. sandy, you want to take the (multiple speakers) and then, irial, you want to comment? the key to the north america growth algorithm is investing in our brands and our feet-on-the-street. a key element to that is getting our pricing so that we can have the revenue to be able to reinvest in sustainable growth. where we've had issues over the years, in my experience, in north america, is when we did not get the price we needed, when our marketing execution was not what it need to be, and therefore the feet-on-the-street started to get reduced and ultimately it hurt sustainable growth. our plan going forward, and it's going to take some time, and we're focused on improving it, is to make sure that we get the price and that we execute the marketing well and feed the feet-on-the-street, which creates the virtuous cycle in the united states just like it does around the world. irial, do you want to add to that? the only comment i'd say -- muhtar already mentioned that we are an industry leader. and industry leaders have to set the tone in terms of price, in terms of how to market the brand in any given markets. actually less than 50 days in to my new involvement in north america, i'm really excited about the future. i'm excited about the enthusiasm, the passion of our people, our job -- mine, paul's, sandy's -- is really to make sure that excitement translates into performance and to results. as sandy said, it's not going to happen overnight. i feel we've already started on the journey, and over the next quarters and next couple of years, you will see very positive momentum in our market in north america.
25;7;258;7;0.027131782945736434;yes. nothing different than before. so no change. we're obviously very excited with our new opportunities for consumption as will be brought to us by the partnership with green mountain over time. the key is to fuel the power of partnerships. the coca-cola company and system is an incredible integration of power of partnerships in every respect. and therefore, this is yet another one. so think about -- if you look at household consumption, in particular the western markets, there's a tremendous opportunity to gain incremental consumption occasions for our brands through these kind of partnerships. this is what the green mountain partnership is all about. when you look at how beverages are consumed at home and when you look at trends in the next 10 years, people are going to spend more time at home. they're going to work more from home. home is going to be an even more important place for people, for consumers. and we need to be present there with different technologies, different packaging, different ways to serve our brands, and that's why this is important and partnerships like these are going to be important for us over time going forward. our thinking has not really evolved or changed in terms of bolt-on acquisitions. if we see opportunities, we will get them, like innocent, like [oshan] and so forth. and we will continue to seek new power partnerships -- to leverage new power partnerships also going into the remaining part of our 2020 vision for the next six years.
25;8;98;4;0.04081632653061224;first, ali, i disagree with you. we have a great portfolio of brands SEMICOLON we have a great system, the best consumer product system in the world SEMICOLON and i believe that our programs will work and have worked. we've significantly outperformed and grown since 2010. yes, we've had a speed bump and certainly that makes us even more focused and more resolute to continue on our road to 2020. we have -- i will share at cagny on friday, the real reasons why we believe in our future. and so that's all i would say.
25;9;274;11;0.040145985401459854;i understand. i understand it's easy for people to have very short memories. but we have the experience and we know what we are doing and we will continue to do what we believe and we are focused and we will execute the best and we will achieve our 2020 vision. that's what this is all about. so that's what i will say. and we have talked about pricing. you've heard my colleagues also talk about pricing. and we do not want to repeat ourselves. thank you, gary, ahmet, sandy, irial, and jackson. we've delivered sound full-year financial results. we're implementing the strategic actions that will enable us to restore momentum in 2014 and we see many reasons to believe that we can accelerate our growth over time, achieve our long-term growth model targets, and realize our 2020 vision. our global beverage industry is healthy. the trends that have historically fueled it continue to be strong, and our global systems' commitment and reach are unparalleled. this commitment has never wavered and the strategic decisions that we have made over recent years have not only enabled us to deliver solid financial results, they've also advanced our competitive position, enhanced our capabilities, and strengthened our resolve as a global system to achieve our 2020 vision. that is our promise to our investors, to our customers, to our consumers, and the daily objective of the more than 700,000 associates of the coca-cola system all around the world. as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.
26;1;6;0;0.0;thank you, bill. thank you, bill.
26;2;470;9;0.019148936170212766;thanks, bill. . first let me say again, that i am pleased to report that our growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. and in the midst of still -- continued volatility headwinds, achieving sequentially stronger 2% volume growth, that means delivering an incremental 100 million unit cases in the past 90 days or so. that means incrementally, every single day, an additional 27 million actual servings per each day. as the base grows, we are still very proud that we can continue to drive growth. this is a quarter that is where easter has shifted, where we were cycling 4% from prior year, whereas i said macro volatility continued, and where we had the harshest winter in northern hemisphere particularly in the us. we do not think this is a great result, but satisfying, as one step in the right direction to restore momentum. germany, us was flat. in the past quarter, we think, given where -- what we went through and what economies and consumer and climate. turkey was up 2%, japan was up 3%. france was up 4%, brazil was up 4%, india and russia was up 6%. china was up 12%. these are -- these show, and give us the proof points that our actions are working. and i think this is a quarter again where only a small fraction of our incremental marketing went -- was deployed. i would say probably around -- so 5% of our total incremental marketing for the year was deployed in this quarter. as we ramp up the quality and also quantity of our marketing, i believe that certainly we are going to drive better alignment. we have really good plans in place, fully aligned with our bottling partners. and i would be disappointed, as would be all my colleagues and associates, if we do not go back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for volume growth. but also importantly, we are driving not just volume growth, but we are driving immediate consumption growth. when you look -- which is really important for our business. when you look at -- say in this past quarter, of top five countries growing as -- china up 18% in ic growth. indonesia up 9% in ic growth. vietnam up 8%, brazil up 5%. these are really important numbers, because it is sustainable growth. it is profitable growth, and it is growth in transactions, which is directly married to the health of the brands, and the health of our portfolio. so from that perspective again, i want to just register cautious optimism that i feel we would be disappointed if we do not fall back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for the remainder of the year, in terms of the volume growth picture, and also the other key metrics that follow on from there.
26;3;2;0;0.0;thanks, bryan.
26;4;401;11;0.02743142144638404;bryan, . last question first on brazil, i think brazil was out the gate first, in terms of the fifa world cup activation, a lot of noise around that, a lot of activation in stores. and i think that certainly, we also see a little less malaise in terms of the macroeconomic environment. so and again, in terms of also the relationship between durables and nondurable consumer goods was a little bit more in favor for us. so we feel that is going to continue, and that brazil will have a better year. and i think the government is also aware of what they need to do, as they lead into one of the biggest events in their history, which is hosting a memorable event like the world cup. as far as mexico is concerned, i think sparkling volume for us was sort of in the mid single-digits decline for the first quarter. the important thing here is that, because of the strength of our brand, because of also the incredible richness of our packaged portfolio, and our occasion brand price pack channel architecture, the strength of that in mexico, we are seeing that we are gaining market share, versus both local competitors and our international competitor in mexico as well. and that -- and again, we -- it is too early days related to mexico. but i would say that we are again, executing with great precision and passion in mexico with our great bottling partners. and then, in terms of price mix, including a favorable geographic mix, other points came as the result of high inflation in local markets. and again, i will ask gary to comment related to the venezuela piece. yes, bryan, venezuela definitely contributed positively in the quarter to positive price mix. now with going forward, that will no longer really be the case, because we have adjusted the -- as of the end of the quarter, we have adjusted the exchange rate and we will be using the [vef]10.8 exchange rate going forward for most of the revenues, a large part of the revenues in venezuela. so that will come down. but that impact is included in the latest currency forecast that i gave you. so again, some of the other currencies actually have improved from what we talked about in the february call, that offset now by venezuela. so still at the same 7% impact.
26;5;65;1;0.015384615384615385;oh, yes. (multiple speakers). definitely positive price mix going in there. and i think the other thing to point out, and muhtar said it, i said it. but i think it is really important as you look at this quarter how we drove value share ahead of volume share. so we are definitely focused on rational pricing across the world, and getting -- earning price. thanks.
26;6;2;0;0.0;thanks, john.
26;7;237;2;0.008438818565400843;yes. well, i will try john, and we will see how this goes. but basically, they are -- let's go to marketing first, and let's talk about it in two different ways. one is, how much of the marketing is actually in the market. and that is what muhtar was referring to, how much is -- of the marketing is actually hitting the consumer, and a lot of our incremental spend actually has not hit the consumer yet. it will -- it is much more weighted, starting in the second quarter going through q4. a lot of the first quarter really focused on getting the quality of our marketing up, and that sort of thing. that is different from the way we account for marketing, and marketing as you referenced is on the sales curve. so on the sales curve, that incremental marketing is included in what we expensed in the first quarter. now, then we get into the marketing that we are cycling quarter by quarter from last year. and so, it was an increase in marketing. in the first quarter, the increase will significantly grow during the year based on what we are cycling. that is part of why i said, that 4 points of operating leverage will go to even to slightly positive, and we are also benefiting from some other timing in the first quarter in just some of the opex expenses as well.
26;8;341;7;0.020527859237536656;yes. i would say the mood is positive, in terms of their willingness to invest, their appetite for new territories. i have always -- you have heard me say this before in terms of litmus test for the health of the business. there is a lot of appetite for growing in -- horizontally in territory, and trying to get -- expand. and i think in terms of the quality of our marketing, in terms of the quantity of our marketing, i feel that based on all the bottlers that i have [priced] in this past quarter, i feel good. i feel positive about the sentiment, both here in the united states, as we start our path to franchising, and as we look at how we expand and how we hasten the pace of franchising, but also across the world. i have recently have been with many bottling leaders, and talked to many of them. we have a global system meeting next month. also, about 50 of the top bottlers get together with their ceos and chairmen, and we are there to further align our plans for 2015 and beyond. but i feel good related to the plans in place, related to everyone's desire to execute better and to invest more into the future. and again, based on the investments that have gone into the marketplace, in the third and fourth quarter of last year. i feel -- that is why i feel confident that you are going to see us back into the corridor of the 3% to 4% long-term growth algorithm for the balance of the year, as we keep restoring momentum. so that is what i would say. do we have some pockets of challenges? you mentioned coca-cola amatil. i feel, again, very cautiously optimistic as alison watkins assumes her new role there, and we are working very closely with her and her team. and again, we are very much aligned as to how we move forward with sab miller and their management team related to their nonalcoholic beverage business.
26;9;5;0;0.0;thank you, judy. thank you.
26;10;273;5;0.018315018315018316;thanks, judy. i will ask ahmet to give you a response onto your question. ahmet? yes, thanks, judy. yes, the results obviously for europe for the first quarter was less than what we would have desired, with the minus 4%. a lot of things came into play with that. you mentioned that easter obviously, that was definitely a factor. and muhtar has mentioned the transition into a new future consumption pack in gb. i would add to that, that there was sort of a pricing activity in the marketplace on future consumption packs that had also had some impact. and we are in very close discussion and alignment with our bottlers to make sure that we actually sort of respond in a way that we maintain rational pricing in the marketplace, but also balance volume growth and value growth at the same time. so that was one. you mentioned southern europe. the slight improvement that everybody sees in iberia and spain, that we see as well. our numbers had a bit of noise in it, with regards to the strike in our iberian bottling partners that you all have heard about before. we have had great mitigation plans in place and executed them. and the negotiations -- or sorry, the restructuring is expected to end in may, and we continue to see improvements in our iberian business as well. so we expect, as we move into quarter 2, remove the effect of easter, fully implement our obppc in gb and continue to finish our restructuring in spain, we expect to see improvements in europe over the next quarter and the rest of the year.
26;11;484;11;0.022727272727272728;yes, judy, this is muhtar. let me frame again, just a couple important takeaways. for britain, rational pricing was really the theme for us in q1. and the very -- the strength of our marketing program, the strength of our commercial program leads us to believe that we will see improvement as we go into q2 and q3 and q4 in britain. that is the takeaway, i would say. again, the same phrase and motto for our us business, rational pricing. that is the takeaway. and we had 2% to 3% price mix in our sparkling portfolio in the us, and you will see that continuing. and i will ask sandy to and irial to reflect on further details on that for the year. thanks, muhtar. pricing, we expect pricing for the full year in sparkling to actually improve from the first quarter. our plans are in place with our customers. the market is rational. our focus on immediate consumption growth will drive mix, and our rate should continue to be healthy, and even improve as we move through the second quarter and into the third quarter where we are lapping some promotional activity. so that is point one, point two is, on stills, the case pack water business continues to grow, so it pulls down mix. we see opportunities, however, on a targeted basis in our bottle can stills to improve pricing, and we will take action to do that. paul, irial and i see opportunities on a category by category basis. and then finally, in our chilled juice business, we have just fielded a significant price increase to respond to the commodity issues with our orange juice in florida, and that is taking root. and our juice business continues to be advantaged from a share perspective. and i think all of that wraps up, from a pricing standpoint to a much more favorable profit outlook for the full-year. i mean, we saw some timing related issues, and obviously we have talked about having 1 less selling day in the first quarter. but all of that is going to come to do with our price and volume plan for the year to produce profit growth for the full year. irial? yes. the only add i would give is, we are about building a long-term sustainable profitable business in the us. and to do that, we must have a balance of pricing and volume growth. and pricing is a really critical part of that, and we will in this year end up with sparkling in the 2% to 3% range in pricing, or price mix, i should say. and that is really it, and that is what we are focused on. that is what sandy, and the team, paul and the team, all of us together are focused on delivering that -- delivering a healthy business that is going back to growth as well.
26;12;501;16;0.031936127744510975;yes. michael, this is muhtar i will say, just a couple of top line, and then ask again, ahmet to contribute. but i will repeat what i said about ic, particularly pleasing was china, ic was up 18%. indonesia, ic was up 9%, vietnam up 8%. these are really important for us when -- as we drive profitable growth in our business. and again, our newly architected packaging portfolio in china is really working with the smaller packs and the new price points. and i think also, the new team certainly is really delivering what we expect of them, as well as our bottlers with renewed focus. both the bottling investments group but also swire as well as cofco are really doing a good job in the first quarter. and i think a lot of really good investments and activity and commercial leadership is in place to continue to drive that momentum, both in the stills as well as in the sparkling portfolio in china. and so, again ahmet, if you want to just -- (multiple speakers). yes. thanks, muhtar. yes, i think, michael, you have listed a lot of reasons. but my headline would be, it is all of the above. but let me color it a little bit. certainly, the new team and the new strategy that we covered with you last year is really coming together nicely, and we are happy with the quality of the growth. sparkling is growing. juices are growing and those are the categories that we have told you that we were betting on for our growth in china. you might see us -- growth in waters. that is an important category. but we just had some recent launches into a [rmb2] water, which improves the profitability of that. very, very early days, and it is doing well. also, we are quite encouraged with, again very early results on some of our innovations with schweppes and plus. and just a couple weeks out, the plans is our isotonic. so we are getting that good mix of sparkling juices and innovation that is beginning to work for us. i would just caution us though, you did mention the easier cycle rates from last year. that is definitely the case, and 12% growth we are very happy with. but we would expect to see growth in china, continued growth in china, probably in the range of mid to high single-digits that we could expect over time. so that is basically -- i think covers everything. and just one other point i would highlight, michael, is japan, very pleasing that it grew 3%, 3% in sparkling and stills grew 4% in japan in the quarter. and again, despite the longest monsoon that i have ever experienced in terms of seasons and how long it took, india grew 6% and should do much better going forward. so and again, i am certainly very proud that this is the 31st consecutive quarter of growth in india for us, including continued share gains.
26;13;103;4;0.038834951456310676;yes, and again, michael, that is very important market for us, and we have been focused on aligning with our bottling partner, amatil, there on a new plan. or let's say, an evolved plan as was the case in china with the revised obpcc investments in sparkling and still beverages. there has been a recent change in management in -- on the ground. and all of that again, we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we are making in indonesia, are beginning to deliver good results. and certainly, that market has a -- has so much more opportunity to grow in the coming years.
26;14;2;0;0.0;thank you.
26;15;285;11;0.03859649122807018;now -- no changes as far as my perspective is concerned. and i can confirm that both our entire team, as well as our bottling partners feel the same way as a system. we are blessed to be in a great business, both in the sparkling area, as well as in the stills. we continue to innovate. i believe that we have a great future, where so many hundreds of millions of people in so many large markets have not tasted a coca-cola in the last month, or in the last six months, or in the last year. we have tremendous opportunity going forward. and i believe that innovation, packaging, equipment and great marketing will continue to grow our business going forward, both in sparkling and in stills. and i feel confident that we will go back into the corridors of our long-term growth algorithm this year and years to follow. and with new innovations, like creating new paths to consumption, creating new consumption occasions like the keurig green mountain innovation, like freestyle that is driving, we know everywhere, every time, it is actually installed in an outlet, it drives traffic, it drives incidence, it drives increased sales, and it drives excitement for the consumer. and at the same time, our contour packages, you will see us being focused much more on the contour. next year is the 100th anniversary of the contour bottle, the iconic contour bottle. you will see a lot of activity around that also. so we feel we have a lot of work to do. but we feel that, is not that a great place, where you have a lot of work to do, and you believe in your future.
26;16;222;5;0.02252252252252252;i think they will -- i am certain innovation is going to be impactful, and i can not give you any more details on timing. yes. sure. so just thank you again, gary, kathy, ahmet, sandy, irial, jackson, we are just once again, firmly committed to advancing our growth trajectory in 2014. our strategic priorities are yielding tangible and measurable results, and they are consistent with our long-term goals, and our overarching business strategy. increased marketing investments and a focus, a relentless focus on execution underscore the confidence we have in our systems alignment, as we seek to execute these strategies, while we further strengthen the foundation for profitable and sustainable long-term growth. our 2020 vision calls for a well-balanced growth, that is growth in sparkling beverages, and also growth in still beverages across more than 200 markets, countries, and in revenues and margins. and thanks to this balanced growth in both portfolio, as well as geographic mix, we see a path that leads to global volume, revenue and profit growth in line with our long-term targets. our focus is unwavering, and our execution of our five strategic priorities is going to enable us to restore momentum for growth to our business. thank you for your time this morning, and for your continued interest and trust in our company.
27;1;536;25;0.04664179104477612;thanks, judy. again, just to quickly go through the quarter, as you said, volume was up 3%, sparkling volume really importantly was up 2%, and brand coca-cola up globally in north america. those are really three important points. also, another quarter of value market share gains, i think more than 25 consecutive -- 28 to be exact -- consecutive quarters of gaining value share. you see us having at, with our system, very clear focus on priorities. we had our entire global bottling system get together with us a couple -- a few months ago, and again a recommitment to the focus on our priorities. sequential improvement in a lot of large markets, particularly europe, france, germany, great britain, italy, spain. and good results, very strong results out of eurasia and africa and improving in nigeria, south africa, turkey, improvement again if you take asia-pacific. again very strong quarter in china as well as in india, double-digit growth in india, thailand again saw --. so if you take all of those margins that are improving, gross margin has improved in the quarter compared to the prior year. clear path on north america franchising. strong belief that what we're doing is working in our system, is really important. good bottler alignment. yes, there are a few exceptions, but there always have been and will be, and more work to be done. i am the first to say we operate in a very volatile global environment, both politically and economically. china is slowing down is impacting many commodity exporting countries and from africa to latin america. but overall, what we're doing is working: more marketing through productivity gains, better marketing. we mentioned share a coke program in over 80 markets, tremendous leverage on our world cup program in more than 170 markets with probably the biggest activation that we have ever had. and all this will not generally have an impact on the quarter that you spend in. it comes in after with better incidence, better brand loyalty, better purchasing time that we're all seeing. what is happening in north america in terms of sparkling price mix also, you can see that we have a very disciplined approach both in the united states and globally where we have been able to achieve a 2% price mix on a global basis. and yes, there was easter shift, but at the same time, our gallon shipments were below our unit case volume for the quarter. and if you say that would be a -- neutralize the benefit that we may have got from easter, then i think overall we feel pretty confident with, again, the caveat that we need to do a lot more work and continue to do a lot more work, more focus, better execution. but the five priorities are working, and early shoots, green shoots. and we expect that the balance of the year, as i mentioned in my script, that we should be able to fall within the corridor of the long-term growth targets. and again, there may be issues along the way, bumps along the way. but the most important thing is that we are resolutely focused on continuing to build momentum here.
27;2;413;11;0.026634382566585957;i will say a few things and pass it over to sandy, but all i will say is take note of the fact that a very big portion, percentage, 60% to be exact, of the growth came from smaller packages. that is obviously an enhancement of the mix driving revenue, but also rate. so, i will ask sandy and then maybe irial if he has any commentary on north america, but we are operating with tremendous diligence and the discipline in the marketplace. and success for us is a combination of both the growth that we have on the volume, but importantly also growth in transactions which is a really good litmus test of the success of the business that is coming more into play each day as we progress. sandy? thanks, muhtar SEMICOLON hello, judy. we said at the beginning of the year that our focus in north america was going to be a disciplined combination of volume and price and that we would see that as a strategic priority. and the second quarter really reflects that SEMICOLON 3% price mix on sparkling while achieving volume growth on coke. and muhtar mentioned the importance of smaller packages in driving that outcome. it is also important in driving growth because consumers want more smaller packages, and we've been working on developing that as a part of our overall strategy. so lots of discipline. as we look ahead, we are lapping some very promotional activity in the third quarter of last year, and our discipline will remain. and the bottlers in the company around the country are focusing on marketing and selling our way through and maintaining an extraordinary amount of discipline on pricing, and we are optimistic that we will be able to hold that strategy. yes, it is irial. all i can add is really repeat what sandy said, and i have said in the last three calls now, which is we really are focused on building a long-term sustainable business. that is mixing pricing and volume and transactions in a very balanced way and coming up with a great result for our company. and we will do that, and we continue to do it. yes, the only thing i would add here also, judy, is that i think we see a path forward to being able to build more romance with the brand through smaller packages. and that is really an important element in what is also being discussed.
27;3;111;0;0.0;yes, kathy? hi john, and thanks for the question. the venezuela impact, yes, that is a two penny drag on a comparable eps, as well as reported eps. so if you look at venezuela, you take it in two pieces SEMICOLON there is currency impact as well as impact of the provision. the provision is less bolivar nominated revenue because of capital margins, and it is gone straight to the bottom line. and then the fx is, the impact is because, as well, we do not have as much bolivar-denominated revenue in income. so you could split those two pieces, and yes, it is comparable, as well as as reported.
27;4;235;10;0.0425531914893617;so i would split the question into two, and ahmet will help answer with it, but the margins in latin america have been impacted this quarter by the venezuela provision. and then when you look at ongoing buying growth in contribution into the company, i will let ahmet -- john, a couple of points. the rest of latin america, the margin and the growth in profitability overall is in a good direction. no important issues there. also keep in mind that we've been able to realize positive price mix in high-margin places like europe, and we have been able to grow in japan, so we are able to balance across the international territory to have positive price mix and margins. john, just to add, i think yes, you are right in saying that latin america has slowed down to where it traditionally has been. and we have seen these cyclical slowdowns in latin america. and as some parts will get better, i think, starting towards the end of the year, we also see some other volatility, continued volatility in like argentina and other markets. but overall, i think for most of what we are cycling as well, we expect major markets in latin america to have some sequential improvement in the second half of this year. and then overall longer-term, we feel very confident also about what is lying ahead in latin america.
27;5;111;2;0.018018018018018018;okay, hi brian, thanks for your question. our outlook for leverage in the currency neutral basis remains flat to slightly positive. when you think about gross margins, so gross margins have improved for the second quarter and year-to-date. and when we look at -- when we look at our margins for the back half of the year, we delivered sound financial results, and we anticipate that we will continue to deliver sound financial results for the rest of the quarter -- for the back half of the year. and we do anticipate that margins will continue to in the same way they have been in the first half of the year.
27;6;160;0;0.0;yes, we are continuing to invest behind our brands. so yes, that is part of the leverage story. but that is causing the north america from negative -- slight negative leverage in north america because we are spending behind our brand. so, we are getting pricing and we are committed to rational pricing, so we're getting pricing which is helping us with the margins the gross margin, but we are continuing to invest behind our brands. just add to that, bryan, if you look at the second quarter compared to the first quarter, marketing is substantially higher in the second quarter than it is in the first quarter, and particularly towards the back end of the second quarter, substantially higher. so, that explains some of the things again, what kathy was saying, but also our productivity is on target. it has been on target for the first half of the year and will be on target for the second half.
27;7;372;9;0.024193548387096774;yes michael, it is muhtar here, and i will ask ahmet to provide additional commentary. think of brazil as having a very tough macro environment in the first half. so if you look at the entire consumer disposable and non-disposable consumer goods sectors, we are under tremendous duress in the first half of the year, particularly leading up to -- particularly -- more so in the second quarter. think of it this way -- had it not been, the result would not have been what it would've been had we not done all that activity. so from that perspective, i think we see brand getting stronger, incidents and purchase intent getting stronger in brazil as a result of all the activity, and i think that should benefit us going forward in brazil. so certainly the macro environment in brazil, as you can read, as we can all see, has been very challenging. and so given that backdrop, i think, our results -- we're content with where we are, and we believe that what we have done will benefit us in the second half and going forward. in terms of mexico, i think both times prices were adjusted, they included a certain portion for also inflation, so take it as that. but again, i will ask ahmet to provide any further commentary for both brazil and mexico. thanks muhtar. on brazil, the only thing i would add michael is that we had a pricing packaging architecture which allows us to have different tax both for immediate and future consumption at different price points, and we are executing those with great discipline. and that in fact is helping us navigate this challenging external environment. and we expect that to continue to bear fruits in the third and fourth quarters along with the strong marketing programs we have. with respect to mexico, the only other thing i would add is that we do have a not just passing the tax and the inflation, but a consumer-driven pricing approach which has been very carefully calculated, and the elasticity that we have calculated in reality are happening better than that we have expected. so in other words, our mexican business is showing more resilience in this area.
27;8;114;5;0.043859649122807015;i think success for us is certainly continuing our value share gains. you can not obviously -- only value share gains without volume is not sustainable over the long term, but we have a very disciplined approach just like in north america, also for our international business related to more smaller packaging. so the mix will benefit us, but also very importantly it is critical for us to achieve price mix on a global scale. different geographies will again price differently into the picture. we have such disparate pricing per case depending on the geography we're talking about, so geographic mix is an important piece of this, as is package mix, as is rate.
27;9;87;1;0.011494252873563218;i will just say that once again, smaller size packs contributed significantly to, say, brand coca-cola volume and revenue growth into q2 and year-to-date as a matter fact. so, if you take over 60% of the growth in brand coca-cola in q2 was driven by double-digit growth in our mini can and 16-ounce immediate consumption packages, i think that is how i would like to leave you with -- that is what i would like to leave you with as an opportunity.
27;10;228;13;0.05701754385964912;yes i will take the last first. the strategy is driven by what consumers want, and that is not just a phenomenon for the united states but smaller packages are a key focus. so that helps the mix. that helps the revenue. that helps also the price mix. then, couple that with a very disciplined approach towards also having the right balance between value and volume share gains. and so it is really important. in terms of concentration of volume growth, i think the important thing is for you to focus on the improvements from quarter to quarter. if you take key geographies like europe, france had an improvement, germany had an improvement, great britain had a significant improvement. italy had a significant improvement, spain had a significant improvement, and europe overall had a huge improvement when you look at total. and again, this is just pure simply for volume, and if you look at pricing earnings, you will get also a similar picture. so i think focus on the sequential improvements. focus on us delivering on our focused priorities. and so what i see is that we will strive, and diligently strive to continue with sequential improvement, building momentum as we go forward. and i also mentioned as an answer to a previous question that i thought that in latin america, we would also see sequential improvement.
27;11;37;0;0.0;well we announced significant cost cuts over the last four or five years, different programs. and as i mentioned earlier, again we are on target with our productivity. and that productivity is being reinvested to drive growth.
27;12;390;16;0.041025641025641026;i will talk about a couple of levers, and then ask irial to join me. the growth and profitability in north america, the major opportunity exists in pricing and the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the system. we talked about price as a lever and an area of discipline and focused, and price is achieved through rate as you know, and also mix. and a whole lot of innovation is going on inside of packaging to give consumers what they want and to earn a return as a result of that. couple that with our overall system architecture work, which muhtar described earlier which is on track as we overhaul it, product supply, as we overhaul customer management and shared services. and the refranchising progress which is on track with our bottlers, will create a system that is on one hand more effective and grows faster and on another level is more efficient at generating better margins. but at the end of the day, that combination needs to be built on accelerating growth. and the focus of the near-term has been to reinvest the proceeds into marketing to rebuild brand momentum and brand momentum at price point. we're optimistic about the progress, but we have a lot more work to do. yes, the only add i would give is [we're in] to the bottling houses, we remain absolutely committed to deliver one of our core priorities, which is excellence and execution in the marketplace. and as every day goes by, i get more comfortable that we are starting to do things better every day, every time we go to an outlet. and fundamentally that is the other piece that gives us the capability to get extra price and mix in the marketplace, and we will continue to do that. and it is a journey. it is not turning the light switch on. it happens day by day, weak by weak, month by month. i feel pretty good that over the next number of years, our capability in the marketplace, married with great marketing, is going to deliver the price mix we all desire. and that is why the discipline in remaining focused on price mix married with transaction growth and married with volume is why we feel confident about the north american business over the long-term.
27;13;95;1;0.010526315789473684;yes bill, i think in the uk most of that loss was in q1. if you look at q2, we have had sequential improvement in the uk. and we expect that going forward in both mexico and in brazil that more minor losses to the b brands and local players will reverse themselves in the course of the year. and we already see that happening in both markets. i think that was the difficult operating environment in brazil in terms of also us having discipline in our pricing, and the same goes for also mexico.
27;14;3;0;0.0;and very transitory.
27;15;147;4;0.027210884353741496;yes, two things. spending increased as we moved through the quarter, and there was much more spending at the end of the quarter than there was at the beginning of the quarter. and therefore you would expect that not all of that benefit is going to flow, obviously, into the quarter. and this is again about generating long-term sustainable momentum, which we believe is happening. again i want to remind everyone that i am pleased with these results in a difficult operating environment. and to get growth back into sparkling is a significant achievement, to get growth back into coca-cola in the world globally and in the united states is a significant achievement, and we will continue to focus on where we need to be quarter after quarter, one quarter at a time. i just want to say that i believe our approach is working.
27;16;487;10;0.02053388090349076;yes, kevin. obviously, i can not walk you through a wish list SEMICOLON that would be too much information to the whole market and everyone that plays in the market. but i would say our portfolio is really very rich, as you saw as from our $17 billion brand and so many more in the pipeline. and again, our sparkling brands have really performed well on a global basis. sprite and fanta and schweppes in addition to coca-cola. so, all of that tells me that what we're doing in different brands and creating more incidents, more transactions is working. and you heard the numbers that i mentioned in tea both in the us and globally, in premium waters, in juice and juice drinks, in sports drinks, all of that. we are pleased with a much richer portfolio than we had, say, three years ago. and that portfolio is again yielding very good results, particularly, also, simply in the juice category, [dasani], innocent, all those different brands. del valle across the world yielding very good results, and also in china too, and southeast asia with new innovations that are really working well for us in both the fusion of dairy and juice, as well as pulpy drinks and also juice and juice drinks. and on the second part of your question, yes, i believe the company has always been very focused on driving long-term sustainable growth. and we have done that in a very consistent and disciplined way. we are very focused on reinvesting in the business and to accelerate growth and create value. i believe we focus on making sure we have share repurchase and we do give a healthy dividend back, but we will continue basically like we've been going with focusing on driving long-term growth. thank you kathy, ahmet, sandy, irial and jackson. the performance year to date, progress against each of our strategic priorities and the positive signs that we are seeing in many global markets all illustrate our view that the 2020 vision and strategic plans are solid. proof points are out there. 3% growth in the quarter, global price mix of 2%, increased global media spending reflecting our confidence in building on the strength of our brands and also in our ability to engage our consumers and customers effectively, and global year-to-date value share growth in our categories. and so we are winning in the vibrant beverage industry and also coupled with sound financial performance during the first half of the year. so we're making steady progress. and we are where we are expected to be at this stage in the year. i look forward to providing all of you with additional updates as we continue to restore our global momentum in the months ahead. thank you for your time this morning and for your continued interest and trust in the coca-cola company.
28;1;304;2;0.006578947368421052;yes. bryan, , again, this is muhtar. i think the most important is that our eps target remains high single-digits and our target for profit before tax is still 6% to 8%. beginning in 2015, revenue growth will be added as a metric in the company's incentive plans as well. so we're obviously looking at a metric, really, where the target remains 6% to 8% and moving the target to pbt really brings net interest and equity income into consideration. if you look back at the last three years, there really has not been a leverage between oi and pbt, meaningfully so. it would not have really made a difference. having said that, it does go back to what we said about broadening our long-term net revenue target to mid-single digits. we think that there's opportunity to grow equity income as we advance our existing partnerships, as well as explore similar models in the future. using pbt instead of oi should make operations, in a way, agnostic in terms of evaluating alternatives to extract value in a certain given category SEMICOLON for example, what you mentioned also, which is partnership model versus concentrate model. so i think it's a better broadened way of ensuring that we can deliver long-term sustainable value to our shareowners. and i'll pass it on to kathy if she wants to add anything. i'd just also say, bryan, remember we anticipate and we've been saying that with the increases in interest rates, we will have interest expense versus interest income that we've been generating. so we do not anticipate interest providing leverage below the line going forward. so the bottom line is we can not make the 6% to 8% pbt without a significant amount coming from operating income.
28;2;9;0;0.0;no. not at all. no suggestion in any respect.
28;3;344;5;0.014534883720930232;hi, ian. this is muhtar. . firstly, let me just give you some context around the base. if you take, firstly, that's why we put out two numbers out there, $2 billion by 2017 and $3 billion by 2019, in order to ensure that everyone sees that this is not back end-loaded, it's just a number that really will be generated and the run rate will be flowing through into our system and then we will invest some and use some for margin enhancement. we did say that it will take some time to achieve. 2015 is a critical year where we really -- it's the most important year for us to make the changes that i mentioned to you in terms of a leaner, better operating model and therefore, i think that year should be seen as a year in transition. the base, really, when you look at our company, you see about $5.5 billion in total in marketing, about $4 billion in opex, and really, of the $3 billion, about $1.5 billion will come out of that base of around $9.5 billion to $10 billion and then the other $1.5 billion of the $3 billion will come out of the about $25 billion cogs base. it's important to understand for everyone that we will not be taking down the second number, $1.5 billion, when we refranchise with our aggressive refranchising program, particularly for the united states, between now and 2017. so that number will stay that way and then the bottlers will get additional opportunities for cogs synergies as the territories get refranchised on top of the $3 billion. so i hope that gives you some flavor and explanation into and answers some of your questions. kathy, go ahead. ian, if i could just add, on the initial $1 billion program, $400 million was in 2014 and we are on track. so it continues into 2015 with the rest of the productivity giving us the flexibility to achieve our targets over the long-term.
28;4;57;2;0.03508771929824561;yes, i think given the macroeconomic volatility out there and given the fact that marketing investments are taking some time to flowback in terms of benefit, i'd just say that's the best we see right now and we will come back with a more robust and more detailed discussion on 2015 in our december call.
28;5;359;13;0.036211699164345405;yes, ali. i think what we're talking about is a balanced approach that will bring us back to our long-term growth trajectory in terms of our financial performance. that is a combination of both growth, more realistic and better sustainable growth on the top line, as well as margin enhancements. so as we said before, this additional program of productivity will yield, will generate two things: we believe clearly better growth, as well as better margin enhancements. the important thing here is that we will have a much better geographic segmented analysis of countries where, if you take the developed countries, we will be driving profitable growth through innovation and productivity SEMICOLON for example, with countries like spain, korea, great britain, japan, us, france, and so forth. and then in terms of the developing countries, they will have a slightly different role maximizing value through segmentation and ensuring that we continue to build consumer loyalty markets like latin america, turkey, poland, nigeria. and in emerging markets like china, india, indonesia, thailand, and so forth, we'll be maximizing more skewed on the volume side and investing for accelerated growth. that is why we believe we need to continue to invest and the world is a very big place. it's not just the countries that we live in and we know. it's a very wide place out there and there is significant opportunities to continue to generate growth, while at the same time -- and we believe that there is a very good line of sight of how we invest and how we get return from that investment, very disciplined and very important transparent line of sight. that's the way we look at the segmentation approach and therefore, revenue, which is the target of what we've indicated to you will be a composition of volume and price and so we're not throwing volume out of the door. it's a very balanced approach towards how we will generate revenue, how that revenue will flow into bottom line, both through the additional revenue growth achieved, as well as through enhancements in terms of the margin.
28;6;125;0;0.0;yes. i think we're not ready to share that detail with you right now. however, i think as we go along, we'll give you more insights. but certainly, it will not all be invested and it will not all flow into the bottom line, but i think we see a clear balance there as we go forward. and i think there's a different role -- obviously, there's a different role of how you should think about the $1.5 billion that is coming out of the base of total marketing and opex and also the $1.5 billion that is coming out of the cogs and i think both of them have slightly different roles in how they will be played out.
28;7;192;1;0.005208333333333333;i think you should think of the entire company as evolving and changing. but as i said, dara, i think the important thing is roles and responsibilities on a geographic basis with complete clarity of roles. so if you take the markets like -- the more developed markets of korea and spain and great britain and so forth, japan and united states, canada, more focused on the balance of revenue. what will drive the revenue? slightly skewed in favor of price versus volume. what will happen in the developing markets, more like latin america and some eastern european markets, and so forth, turkey, much more straight line, right in the middle balance of how that revenue number is going to be generated, that revenue growth target is going to be generated. then you take the lower per capita, more emerging markets that i mentioned, of the indonesias and indias and chinas of this world and southeast asia as skewed more towards volume. but that does not mean that there's not a pricing metric and that does not mean there's no incentives based on revenue. it's just how they're skewed.
28;8;567;8;0.014109347442680775;i'll ask sandy to comment on that north america number. sandy and irial are here and i'll ask sandy to first comment on that. yes, dara, our view of the pricing strategy in the us is being very consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year. very focused on making sure that we get our price, that we balance that with a package strategy that's focused on our premium packs and our smaller packs, which consumers want, and continue to grow double digits. we're pleased, as you can see in the nielsen data and the marketplace, the consumer's responding with accelerating sales growth. actual volume was slightly better than we expected and clearly the volume on the premium packs that are the focus of our brand building agenda and supported by our advertising are driving the train. we're just at the beginning, though. i think north america's ability to play a primary revenue growth role in the company with this disciplined balanced strategy is in the early stages and we see a rational environment and we see a good competitive environment in which the category sales performance is accelerating and we're optimistic about the future. irial, do you want to add to that? yes, i'd just remind all of us, in the first quarter, we said we were going to have a very disciplined approach to pricing in north america and the last three quarters we've demonstrated that and the intention is to keep doing it. we feel good about it. we feel we're going the right direction and feel very confident as we actually head into the future on pricing in north america. yes. maybe i'll ask ahmet to comment also on the same subject as it pertains to europe and as it pertains to latin america and some other markets. ahmet? thanks, muhtar. as we talk about the revenue focus, we are also focusing on balanced revenue growth in coke international. maybe a couple of examples i could share is in mexico for example, where you see 2% growth in volumes for the quarter and more or less flat volumes, we're actually seeing fairly healthy price mix of about low to mid-single digits and our revenue growth reflects that as well. likewise in brazil, we're also seeing mid-single digit revenue growth, even though our volumes are up only 1%. we are quite cognizant of balancing our revenue growth with appropriate pricing realization and volume at the same time. do you want to say anything about europe? and in europe, obviously we are not pleased with our volume performance of negative 5%, but the challenging macros are bringing with it a fairly aggressive pricing environment in the marketplace. we are always trying to balance our pricing with volume. in this quarter, i would say that we were a lot more in favor of pricing where we have realized 3 points of price mix in europe, which resulted in a revenue decline of 2%, while our volumes were 5%. having said that, this is a journey and an ongoing balancing act. we would be focusing on balancing that a little bit better so that our share performance continues to be strong, which it has been for the last four years, and we are on that journey in europe.
28;9;443;8;0.01805869074492099;i think, bill, firstly, it's fair to say that we are in a challenged disposable income growth environment. that's no question. the consumer is challenged everywhere around the world. it's not just related to the western developed markets of europe and japan and united states and canada, but it's also related to emerging markets. there's a lot of volatility in the world when you look at in the currencies, when you look at interest rates, when you look at the growth rates, and when you actually factor in all the different geopolitical issues around the world. there just is a lot of apprehension. less people traveling because of disease, because of scares, because of other things, mobility is down and traffic is down and that all impacts, particularly, our immediate consumption business. so we've got to find newer, better ways to ensure that our products, our brands, our 3,000 products, 550 brands can meet up with consumers on different occasions, on better occasions, on newer occasions, and on more innovative ways to get our products in front of our consumers. certainly, we recognize that, that is a challenging environment. we operate in that environment, but we have still one of the most dynamic consumer goods businesses in the world. we believe that it can still, over time, grow at the rate that we have just outlined to you in terms of revenue growth. is that going to happen overnight? no. can we get there? absolutely, yes. then we have other elements to deal with in terms of trends. so we recognize that we have to do more work on diets and lights, for example. we continue to innovate. we continue to launch new products which have different sweeteners and different sweetener bases. that will continue in an expanded mode: more innovation, more packaging, and newer ways for consumers to connect. next year is the 100th year of the contour and we certainly will be expanding our ic focus -- our immediate consumption focus in the market, which is a really important way to build habit and build trends and build [team incidents] and then improve our marketing and improve our commercial strategies with our bottlers, which we keep working at. so that's where we are. it is a very challenging environment anywhere you go around the world. it's not different. everyone is apprehensive, whether it's governments, whether it's ngos, whether it's businesses, local businesses and international businesses. i do not see that improving overnight, but i think it's the new normal. in that new normal, we need to generate better growth.
28;10;28;0;0.0;no. no specific read through. i would just say that given where we are right now, this is the guidance we thought we should provide at this time.
28;11;12;0;0.0;we did give a different outlook on currency, which does impact cash.
28;12;207;4;0.01932367149758454;it's irial. on the supply chain in north america, basically this is a continuation of what started a few years ago and it's made up of many different aspects, which we'll share in due course, as kathy has already said and muhtar. but the key is that we're looking at becoming more effective and more efficient. we have a very substantial supply chain footprint and we believe and have the plans to make sure we become truly efficient and that means by streamlining in many different ways. simple illustrations are things like the bottle life weighting, which is pretty well carried out across the world today, whether it's mechanizing at different parts of our supply-chain, whether it's our footprint, our supply chain and so forth. so many different aspects, but very clear plans behind it and a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the synergies that we've set out. on that, once again, i wanted to reiterate the point that i made earlier, this is muhtar, that of the $2 billion by 2017 and the $3 billion by 2019, the incremental synergy program, that is not going down as we substantially refranchise our business in north america.
28;13;424;13;0.030660377358490566;judy, this is muhtar. . yes, we are streamlining and simplifying our operating model for better speed, better decision-making and enhanced, also, local market focus that will help us to drive better growth. this work is moving forward aggressively. it's global. it involves a center and involves the entire company and we expect to refocus the role for our corporate center and further scale our back-office to support our processes and also policies on a global basis to get more synergies there and better service to our business units that operate around the world that basically make up the coca-cola company. this will enable those operations to fully focus intently on demand creation in their market. so this is really important. it's a delayered organization. it is a simplified organization. it's less touch points, it's faster decision-making and that will take place, starting with the beginning of the year and you'll hear more about that in the coming weeks. so that's important. i think it's important, if i just take back a minute and just to say again, this is certainly a difficult operating environment and that is clear. no question about that. but today, we're announcing, i believe, definitive actions as a team to address that environment and improve our execution. the $3 billion in synergy enhancements are an added layer and an added layer of segmented analysis on top of the $3 billion in metrics on a market-by-market basis is clear evidence, i think, of us taking action to control, in a way, what we can control. i'm so pleased that we have a team that has basically worked together for a long time and we know what it takes to win. today, we are taking essentially additional steps to get us back on track over the longer term and we will do whatever we have to do to get there to get us to that bridge. we know it can be done and we know we will do it. i think the synergy program will help, the new operating model will help, the enhanced execution will help, the better marketing will help, and the improved commercial strategy will help along those lines. is the operating environment tough? it is tough. but we are fortunate to be in a business that is one of the most dynamic businesses in the world SEMICOLON the nonalcoholic, ready to drink business. and so that's what i would leave you with.
28;14;241;7;0.029045643153526972;thanks, judy. we do not like to talk about weather too much in this, but i would say there was probably not so favorable weather. you mentioned the macros. let me start with china. you could see from the numbers in china that total food and beverage industry, nartd industry is actually under pressure and the growth rates are coming down. but i'm very pleased with our performance in china because now we see a lot of traction on sparkling beverages, which actually grew in the quarter. trademark coke was up 4% in china, which shows that the strategy that we have shared with you all, beginning of the middle of last year, of segmented focus of our beverages in china is actually working. we're very pleased with our new launches of the isotonics. that's doing very well. very pleased with our innovations in sparkling with things like schweppes c'plus. so for china, i'm very pleased with the results and we're gaining share and our initiatives are working for us. when it comes to europe, i have shared with you all a little earlier, it is more a matter of balancing our price realization and volume a little bit more in the favor of volume and share, still realizing good price mix. i would say other than that, europe performance was mostly to do with the macros and you've mentioned weather. i will not.
28;15;225;4;0.017777777777777778;john, this is muhtar. when you look at the current revenue figure that we've put out there, if you take the midpoint of that, it's only 50 basis points different than what was out there before earlier. so i do not see that as a major difference in terms of the category, in terms of the cyclical long-term macroeconomic. i think we see tremendous opportunity in this segment, in this very dynamic consumer goods industry. so i see that's not any major shift. we've been pleased with productivity in terms of what we've done to date. macros have not improved and so we have to do what we need to do in order to ensure that we can cross the bridge and get to better both top line growth, as well as bottom line delivery of performance and that's what you see us doing right now. in the past, you would have cycles in macro, you would have a year or two years of down and then coming back up and now it's constant volatility and actually increased volatility every day around the world and increased apprehension by the consumer. so we have to do more. we have to ensure that we create the flexibility to deliver our results and that's what you see us doing.
28;16;109;1;0.009174311926605505;kathy, you want to add anything in terms of investment, in terms of the efficiency, what john talked about? sure, muhtar. first of all, going back to the first question around the net revenue, the two things that are primarily driving the change would be the value growth that we see coming from emerging markets, as well as the more volatile nature of the emerging markets and then recognition that our partnership models will drive value for the business that will impact equity income. so i just wanted to add that particular point. then on the productivity -- sorry, i do not remember the productivity question. what was the question?
28;17;167;4;0.023952095808383235;yes. there actually is, john. what we have done in the past is we've said that productivity, the original $1 billion is made up of both opex as well as reallocation of marketing to ensure that marketing is more effective and more efficient in terms of its delivery of results. so that is an ongoing program that we have in terms of how we will continue to reallocate marketing to drive better value and better return. that is there. that is ongoing. however, of course, the scale of what we're doing in terms of opex flexibility is going to be much, much bigger here, but the vast majority of the additional savings program is hard savings in productivity. the vast majority is hard savings as opposed to reallocation. we will ensure that the amount of money that's invested has a return. that's a different answer, but we will make -- it is actually, i'd say, the vast majority, in fact, is hard savings.
28;18;49;0;0.0;when all is said and done i'd say probably, mark, it will be about mid-single digits in 2014. i think we'll give you, again, in december, we'll come back and give you more flavor about how we're thinking of that in 2015 and beyond.
28;19;5;0;0.0;i would not assume that.
28;20;82;0;0.0;look, i said the vast majority is hard savings in productivity programs and that is composed, as i mentioned earlier in answering another question, that is composed of a base of about $9.5 billion, $10 billion comprised of marketing and opex and then another base, which is driving about a $1.5 billion by 2019. the other half, $1.5 billion by 2019, is driven by cogs savings. but these are hard savings, not in terms of just soft or reallocations.
28;21;654;21;0.03211009174311927;this is muhtar. first i think, based on the collective judgment of myself and my team, as i said to you, this is an acknowledgment of a continuing difficult operating environment and controlling and taking action to control what we can control. that will mean two things: create flexibility through the synergies and also ensure that we can enhance our margins and build a credible and sustainable revenue growth on the top line. that is the key here, which at this industry, lends us to believe and clearly, the history has shown that this industry is the most dynamic and it continues to be. therefore, we believe that when we segment our markets in the way we have segmented them, continue to ensure that we have the right metrics in place and the right incentives in place, that we will perform better. we're almost finished with this year and we're going to be embarking upon implementing this now so that we can start the year running. we will give you a very clear dashboard in december where you can -- with three or four things to follow you can judge our progress -- judge our progress as to how we're implementing and generating the results out of this program. that, to me, i think, is going to be key, following our progress and we will follow it and you will be able to follow it. we'll give you that dashboard so that you can ensure that every quarter we can have a discussion on the key four or five elements of success on how we implement the new operating model, how we implement better marketing, how we implement better commercial strategies, and how that's impacting the top line and what impact that's having on margins. as far as the north america franchising, i'll ask sandy to comment on that. but, again, it's a clear timeline. first, by 2017 and then what we will have left is about one-third and then what we do with the rest is latest by 2020, again, finding the right home. sandy? sure, steve, on north america refranchising, i go back to the objectives of the effort, which is to restructure a system that was in place for over 100 years to get it in better position for growth with better focused customer management, more efficient product supply, and back services and to refranchised to the best coca-cola bottlers in the united states under a new franchise agreement that is fit for purpose of growth. we are very optimistic about our ability to deliver that kind of growth profile and to do that in a way that makes our business more economic and makes our system more economic going forward. so as we point to the december discussion that kathy's going to lead, we'll have a number of the details that will help you model this going forward. but our strategic mission has not changed and our optimism for success in doing this with our bottlers is as high as ever. thank you, kathy, ahmet, sandy, irial, and tim. despite gaining global value share, our year-to-date performance is not where it needs to be. the scope and pace of our actions have to increase and we're moving very quickly to streamline our operations and further align our incentives to drive revenue growth while simultaneously driving costs out of our business through an aggressive plan. while the short-term macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we are confident in our ability to return to sustainable growth as the long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising. our brands and our global system are unparalleled and we are all fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company. as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.
29;1;366;11;0.030054644808743168;first, just at a very high level, 10,000 feet, 2015, we expect the macro environment to even become a little more volatile versus 2013 and 2014, as the microeconomic vagaries get worse in certain parts of the world. rate of interest, currency, certainly, will add to the volatility. growth gap will -- in some part versus other parts -- are going to grow. take, for example, the united states and great britain, two large western economies, starting the year 2015 strong, whereas the eurozone, japan, and most of the emerging world starting the year slower. so there is this gap and some catching up to do. we're gaining share across the world in sparkling juices, important categories. the industry -- we see some evidence that there's some things that are working for us, but we need to be cautious and take it quarter-by-quarter. that's really important. as far as latin america is concerned, colombia seems to continue to do really well as an economy. there's some more lifting to do in mexico and brazil and south cone, but i was recently in latin america, and our business there continues to -- we have a fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short- and long-term growth and we continue to gain share. we have a very strong package product channel segmentation and architecture in pricing, competitive, but at the same time, great revenue growth management strategies working there. europe, as per the last quarter, quarter four, which we are just reporting on, the southern european countries continue to be challenged. germany, our business was very much in the positive. northern europe was a better environment for us than the south and eastern europe is again challenged by some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the east. so that's how we would see them. asia, we're still very bullish, and africa. you see the actions we've taken related to reorganizing our bottling structure to even better suit the growth potential and the opportunities, there, in both indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, as well as the very dynamic 1 billion-plus consumers in africa.
29;2;540;13;0.024074074074074074;yes. when you look at lrb or nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, bryan, what you would see, probably, is maybe 100 basis points less growth versus the previous years, but, it's again, anybody's guess as to how quickly some of these economies are going to come back. we have definitely those contingencies built in. maybe i can refer to ahmet to give you a few more snapshots of the world in terms of micro and macro picture? ahmet? thanks, muhtar. bryan, the only thing i would add to muhtar's characterization is that volatility comes on top of a slowdown, but what's working for us, is that we are getting more and more traction on our plans and programs working with our bottlers. i was in about four or five different countries over the last couple of weeks. even though we witness economic volatility or uncertainty, even in even in northern europe, yes there is quantitative easing, yes, there is lower oil prices, but it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from that. but even within that, our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investments and our alignment with our bottling system, is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the guidance that has been provided. there are a couple of bright spots, too. i was in india, probably one country where there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic development. as you know, we have an incredible momentum in india over the last seven or eight years, especially last year. our plans continue to build on each other from year-to-year. i was in brazil. again, a similar story. after the elections, there was some cautious optimism and that caution side of that continues. there's still a bit of optimism, but we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment. as you know, brazil had a mid-single-digit growth over the end of the quarter. yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year, but we've also had very strong share gains in brazil. so i would say that is our story. there is volatility on top of a slowdown, but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bumpers. bryan, last thing i would add to what ahmet and what i had said earlier, to your question about does it make sense to invest in media and marketing, and the answer is, absolutely, yes. when we are able to target our investments in media and the way we are doing it, segmenting them by the different countries and the different regions of the world and improving not just the quantity but also the quality of the media, that's one of the main important factors that we see driving a better revenue number, a better price mix number. so the two are really connected and that's what i really want to -- gaining share, improving on the top line through all the actions we're taking, of which targeted media, increased and improved quality media, is one of those.
29;3;302;5;0.016556291390728478;i'll let irial answer that question, and then also, sandy will add flavor to that, too. , judy. the most important thing is, four quarters ago, sandy and i spoke on the topic and we reiterated our belief in having balanced price mix volume growth in north america. we've delivered on that in every quarter this year and our plan is to deliver again next year in the same way. in terms of your question on mix and headline price, it's a balance approach. yes, in the fourth quarter last year, we were trending some lower numbers where we had some promotional activity, but when you look over the half-year, as muhtar said, we grew pricing 4%. so we feel very good about the actions we are taking. we're feeling very good about how the trade is reacting and more importantly, we are feeling very good that our marketing and our execution are coming together in a way that really adds incremental value to our system. i will maybe ask sandy to add to that. sandy? , judy. as irial said, it's a consistent strategy. the strategy is [born] of where the consumer wants us to go. the consumer is buying smaller special packages of our sparkling beverage brands and accelerating that purchase and we're seeing the kind of mix benefit from that, that you describe. but that couples with a disciplined approach to rate and volume. because in the end, what we're trying to do is expand the value and usefulness of our brands and create value for our customers. through the consistent execution of that strategy, we are seeing, in 2014, a solid year, but a year of improving performance through the year, and we will continue to pursue that disciplined strategy in 2015.
29;4;74;2;0.02702702702702703;okay, judy. our commodities environment for 2015, commodities we expect really to be benign for us, right? there are some that are absolutely favorable, but then we have other challenges, and depending on -- not a north america, but outside of north america, we also have impact of secondary exchange embedded into our commodities. so we really anticipate it being more of a benign commodity environment for us versus having any significant benefit from it.
29;5;285;5;0.017543859649122806;we're all going to watch what's happening with quantitative easing, john, in europe, 18 months of the planned amount, eur60 billion a month kicking in, whether that will have an impact or not, we will watch and see. stability is the keyword for europe, as we go into 2015, so not getting much worse, and in some areas, continued volatility. south europe is going to continue certainly to be challenged, so i do not think there's going to be suddenly a lifting of the cloud for the consumers in the southern belt of europe. german -- the current exchange rates will help exporting countries, for sure. how soon will that trickle in related to germany, related to other export markets from europe? but that's a positive. quantitative easing is a positive. the notion that most consumers now are used to this environment and feel that it is not going to get much worse SEMICOLON it may get a little better because of the qe. so we'll have to see. but we think that it will continue to be challenged, and then you've got, of course, the whole political environment to, basically, weave into the equation. that political environment is something that is an unknown for us all. that's how i would see. as far as growth, yes, there will be pockets of growth in europe and there will be continued pockets of challenges. what we see -- we have very strong plans in place with our bottling partners for growth in europe and we will see how -- we have all kinds of contingencies built into the plan in europe, also, and we're going to take it quarter-by-quarter.
29;6;58;1;0.017241379310344827;sure, john. for 2016, we are also hedged on our major currencies at this point, and also have some on other currencies, as well. so we will manage the impact and we are at pretty good rates at this point with our hedging, so basically we do not think that there is a relative issue at this point.
29;7;379;6;0.0158311345646438;steve, this is muhtar. again. as far as the rate versus mix, it's basically completely dependent on the country and the environment and the region. there's no trend globally. this is, on average, this much rate and this much -- it all depends on our price/pack channel architecture, our position in our market, the strength of our brand, how effective is our marketing driving the results that we need, which is all work in progress. so it all depends, and i will let sandy comment on the united states on that, but it's very much dependent on the region and dependent on the country and dependent on the circumstances. that's really what i would say. sandy, you want to just address the united states part of that question? sure. our strategy in the us is, again, as irial said, very consistent. we view there to be a significant upside pricing opportunity in the sparkling beverage category. we are driving that with significant investments in brand building and execution of a bright package architecture that will expand margins for our system and also for our customers. that involves a very healthy rate program. but at the same time, we are executing with a tremendous amount of energy, multiple proprietary and other small packages that the consumer is buying at accelerating rates. for example, mini cans increased by 15% in the fourth quarter and that's us following the consumer to smaller package sizes of the brands they love. that combination of rate and mix is creating a good balance with volumes to a healthy top-line growth picture. steve, just on your question on productivity, i would say to you that the reorg and how we are flattening the organization and the number of announced cuts were all part of the program, totally part of the program, so, there's nothing that has it's just been executed. that's all. we stand by what kathy said in the modeling call in december. we are on track with the $500 million-plus piece of the productivity program for 2015 and we are on track with that. but just to emphasize, all of what you see, what you hear, what you read, was part of the program.
29;8;128;0;0.0;just quickly on the last piece of your question, it was part of the initial $2 billion. then, as far as the rate increases, i'll defer to ahmet if you want to just refer to that part of the question. on markets like eag, we price in line with inflation. we may be slightly below inflation, slightly ahead of time. you should expect to see consistent rate increase more or less in that range. fourth quarter for eag was a bit of an anomaly. there was a geographic mix impact that was driven by cycling of [jobend] shipments, so if you look at full-year price mix realization at eag, it's a healthy 4 point, so, i would not look at q4 to draw any conclusions.
29;9;134;2;0.014925373134328358;ali, just on a broad-based answer to your question, it's really critical that we balance the needs in the marketplace and the need for us to be healthy in the marketplace on a both medium- and long-term basis. that's why we hold accountable all our business unit presidents for local currency. we're very happy with our progress so far, with what we are doing with our productivity initiatives and what the current results are for those productivity initiatives, so far. early days. but we certainly are looking to do more where it makes sense. but one thing you will not see us is taking, basically, actions in the marketplace that weakens our position for the medium and long term. that's the critical piece that i want to stress.
29;10;162;5;0.030864197530864196;we work with all the different levers that are available to us, how our better marketing, more marketing is working, driving results, how the investments are working, that we're putting in the marketplace with our bottling partners, our basic brand strength in the marketplace. all of those things. essentially, in terms of commodities, again, that's something that is very volatile in the world that we live in. four or five months ago, if someone said we'd be looking at current price of oil, no one would have believed is. so everything is changing very rapidly and we are remaining flexible and what we can achieve to the best of our ability, both in pricing, both in terms of investing for the future, as well as making sure that our investments are targeted and our segmentation works. there is not one solution. the segmentation is really driving better results than we have anticipated when we put that program into place.
29;11;9;0;0.0;i will just leave it at what i said.
29;12;25;0;0.0;based on our 4-4-5 calendar, the six additional days get pushed into the first quarter, but they come out in the fourth quarter.
29;13;41;0;0.0;that's all local currency. so it is what it is. what we talk about is all pricing in terms of the local currency we take. whether we measure that in sicad 1 or 2, it will be the same number.
29;14;78;0;0.0;for next year, the impact of fair pricing law will continue in venezuela. that is what actually impacts our revenue in venezuela. it caps our ability to take revenue. that does continue. obviously, it starts over in 2015, but it will not be a structural item because we cycle it as of the second quarter. so, then, yes, we also do have an impact to our revenues from a different exchange rate and that would be considered currency.
29;15;146;1;0.00684931506849315;bill, this is ahmet. i will try to address that. one big thing was the timing of the chinese new year, but i would not conclude my comments without saying that the market in china, especially the food and beverage market, has been weakest in the last 10 years. but i would also say that we've been consistently applying our strategy that we have covered with you guys a number of times before and resulting in fairly significant share gains in china. as you know, in japan in the middle of last year, there was an increase in taxes and we're continuing to see the effect of that, but, still delivering almost close to flat but not that close. it's minus [1%]. but the biggest item there was the timing of the chinese new year, as well as continued industry headwinds in china.
29;16;37;1;0.02702702702702703;the corporate unallocated line. yes, that is one place where you will be able to see the restructuring come through, but as muhtar said, we are on track and with everything that we have announced to date.
30;1;1;0;0.0; , brian.
30;2;423;8;0.018912529550827423;bryan, it is muhtar here. again. in north america, i will start with north america, i'd say that the outlook appears to be trending a little positive, raising hopes that potential wage growth and lower fuel prices could translate into consumer spending. in latin america, mexico is, the best way i would say is, relatively stable and continues to track closer to the united states, because they're so closely linked. brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expected. i'd say that. venezuela continues to increase as a concern given the growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the marketplace. and argentina just continues to be challenging. and colombia is again a star in latin america in terms of performance and macro conditions. in europe, i think there are also some green shoots on the back of monetary easing, but it's early days. that just started. deflation still remains a concern this year, and overall, consumer spending in europe i would say is still sluggish, as it will take time for i think monetary easing to flow to the consumer pocket and translate into increased consumer spending, and then risk to recovery [remains] a still volatile environment. then of course you have the possible greece exit issues lingering on. in eurasia and africa, russia continues to see significant challenges, the russian consumer, and we expect it to continue to remain challenging throughout the year this year. sub-sahara africa is a strong bright spot, and we are seeing that in our results. and then middle east, we have got some pockets where it's defying the geopolitical environment, but overall, obviously increased geopolitical risks there. then in asia and pacific china continues, the disposable incomes, consumer spending, cse in china continues to decelerate. we saw that happening in q1, versus the stated gdp of 7%. japan remains sluggish, i would say similar to europe, although we are starting to see some green shoots in the economy. and finally in asia-pacific, india continues to be a bright spot i would say inside the bric end markets, the four bric markets. that's a walk-through. then the commodity environment, again, talking about what we can control and what we can not, remains fairly benign, compared to previous years, stable and benign. given that value growth for us is highly correlated to pce growth, i hope i have been able to give you a quick walk-through of what is good and what is not so good and what is more stable.
30;3;68;1;0.014705882352941176;brian, as muhtar just said, commodities for us will be benign this year. in this quarter, and the first half we're cycling higher prices, in the first half of last year. and thinking about something like oil, oil does not really impact us. for our commodities, we are hedged. we basically are not going to see specific benefit there, and they are going to be basically benign.
30;4;564;8;0.014184397163120567;okay, john, i will take the first part of that question. the gallons and the cases definitely, when you make the adjustment for days, gallons are behind cases, and that will moderate. that will be based on, as you just said, what we see in the first quarter is the higher revenue for cse, and so we did benefit from positive geographic mix in our price mix. that will moderate. we will start to see when it catches up more of the geographies that provide the lower revenue for cse coming through, which will then give us the negative geographic mix coming through as well in the balance of year. i think the second part of your question, on the outlook of pricing, sandy, do you want to talk about at all the north american pricing specifically? sure, kathy. , john. the north america pricing situation is really the continuation of the strategy that we have been talking about for the last year and a half. irial and i talked about this i think six calls ago that we were going to focus our business on the sustaining strategy of disciplined price and volume mix to maximize revenue, with an emphasis on price as a driver in the us business. that is exactly what we have been doing, and what we continue to plan to do with a lot of discipline and focus. as you look at the first quarter, if you look at each business by themselves, we met our pricing objectives in the first quarter. we saw a little bit faster growth in our fountain business, which created a little bit of negative business mix, but net-net, the year started according to plan. we see the outlook as being rational, and our strategy remains very consistent. ahmet, you want to talk about europe? thanks, sandy. hi, john. just a couple of comments in general and then europe, we are following exactly the same strategy of managing our product mix and price versus volume around markets international. in fact, we are getting some pretty good results in many of our big markets. specifically in europe, one must remember that last year, we have had some fairly aggressive pricing, which resulted in our view somewhat of an imbalanced progression of our business, where we have lost some market share, but got great pricing. we were saying before that we would be moderating that somewhat this year, so that we have a more balanced growth of volume and revenue. what you saw in the first quarter is a result of that moderation, but we do believe that we would be achieving reasonable price mix in europe in the course of this year. john, this is muhtar. i will just add one other point, which is related to what i already mentioned, that we are reorganizing and have reorganized our marketing around the different clusters of developed, emerging, and developing markets. i think that is also working, beginning to yield some early results, and i think our new marketing leadership is very committed and very much part of this new reorganization of our marketing around the clusters. i can say very clearly that marketing is playing an important role in how we are generating enhanced revenue in our business. that is really an important takeaway, i think. thanks. i feel good. it is just my voice.
30;5;193;6;0.031088082901554404;the price mix obviously is 3 points, as i just spoke about. we did benefit from positive geographic mix in the first quarter. as we will get as concentrate shipments and timing starts to catch up, we will have the impact of a negative geographic mix which for us is not a surprise, in that it is normal run rate for several of our geographies. we did get the pricing in the quarter and the benefit. then the other side of that would be the costs, and when you adjust for structural, and you adjust for currencies, cost of goods is really in line with concentrate shipments. then the other issue would then just be commodities, and then as we said the commodities are basically going to be benign for us, and in the quarter, we are cycling higher costs from last year. that was a slight benefit. for the most part, i'm looking into the rest of the year, commodities are going to be benign. it is really basically the pricing that we got this quarter, offset by the costs that were better than prior year because we cycled better costs.
30;6;105;2;0.01904761904761905;i also would add one other thing in addition, in north america specifically, we had better business mix, which basically was around our food service business. for the first quarter, in a transition year, we are obviously very pleased with our results. and i would say that i would expect pricing to moderate for the back half of the year, and to continue with -- the cost of goods sold continue to be in line with the concentrate shipments. we were basically given the quarter in line with our expectations and we expect to be in line with our full-year expectations that we have provided.
30;7;457;9;0.019693654266958426;steve, the comments i would make about overall pricing are, to reiterate what i said earlier, which is that on a business by business basis, our pricing results in the first quarter were solid. you saw in nielsen, very strong price growth. some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving with our customers. some of it was lapping some really aggressive promotional activity that happened in the end of february and early march, and some of it was our customers making more money in the category. the net effect of it was a really good start to the year, in line with our plan. if you cross our business over into our chilled minute maid business, we saw price realization there. we launched some new items that drove some incremental revenue. then as i mentioned, the fountain business was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year, which creates a business mix drag overall. what i would say from a profitability standpoint is that the combination of rate and mix was in line with our expectations, but i would also point out that as we get into the second half of the year, you are going to see more difficult pricing comparisons. we will continue our strategy of rigorous and disciplined and focused price volume management, but we will be lapping ourselves, and we'll be continuing to do so, but against a little bit tougher comparison. net-net, off to the start we had hoped to. irial, any additional dimension? (inaudible) repeating what you said, but i'd go back, and i've said this for six calls. we are being very disciplined and rational about our pricing. what we achieved in the first quarter is pretty well in line. sandy's mentioned there's maybe some channel mix impacts in there, but generally speaking, very much in line. we intend to stay disciplined, and i'd used the word [nearly] be boring in terms of how we approach the business. we want to remain disciplined and focus on doing the right things for the business. we believe we are on a good track. we intend to stay on that track, and i think as each quarter goes by, you will see positive momentum in the business. can i just add one more thing? what irial just said then creates the environment for our small packages to grow. the consumer is moving strongly to small packages, and we are continuing to see low- to mid-teens growth in those packages, and all of which is supported by the impact of a step-up in marketing, which gives the whole thing more sustainability, as we work through the more challenging comps.
30;8;177;5;0.02824858757062147;the expected margin improvement over the balance of the year, as sandy just said, so we got good pricing in the quarter. irial said we are very focused on continuing to rationally price. we have higher comps in the back half of the year for pricing that we have to cycle. as far as the refranchising is concerned, i would not expect to see much benefit at this point from the sub-bottling payments. and as you know, if you look at it from an (inaudible) perspective, we structurally adjust those. we pulled them out. we pulled the benefits, so would we put it back on an apples-to-apples basis year-over-year. there is not a big difference at operating versus pbt in our north american operations at this point. for the margin expansion, that is basically really good pricing. as we get really good pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, they are very focused on pricing. that will continue, but we are cycling higher prices in the back half of this year.
30;9;1;0;0.0; , bill.
30;10;217;8;0.03686635944700461;bill, on diet coke, i would describe diet coke still as a work in progress. we have done a number of things on the basics of marketing, graphics, advertising, packaging. we have some very advanced big data driven customer relationship programs going on, with consumers who love diet coke. we are seeing some improvement in the year-over-year revenue, but we are still very much focused on that as a work in progress and expect to. but i would say this. the team and i, and our whole system, believe that in fact we will return diet coke to growth in the long term, but recent improvement, but still work in progress. on refranchising, the refranchising is going according to plan. it is, as we said before, a massive project. we are putting the entire system in on a common erp system, and refranchising the territories one sales center at a time, to make sure that the capability that we build continues to grow, and that our customers are well served in the process. we are pleased with the progress. we have a plan in place that we expect to meet or beat, and we are always looking for opportunities to accelerate it, but not at the expense of really high quality customer service and capability.
30;11;211;7;0.03317535545023697;ali, this is muhtar. first, if it was not for the savings, we would not be able to do what you see us doing in terms of generating that increased marketing, generating all the other things that basically are part of our five point strategy of focusing on revenue, focusing on productivity, focusing on better and more marketing, rewiring the organization for better impact, and focusing on our core, which is the franchising that we talked about. i would just say to you, had it not been for the productivity, we certainly would not be able to enable our organization to generate the kind of momentum that you see beginning to come back in. that is clear. there is no question about that. this is not a four or five sequential compartments. these are a very integrated approach to how we bring more momentum into our business, and everything that i mentioned is happening at the same time, more better [wired] organization, better marketing, marketing that works around clusters, more effective marketing, linked to social media, as well as into a better cost per grp, all of that funded by incremental productivity. i think that is how you need to see our entire different buckets of our strategy coming to life.
30;12;389;6;0.015424164524421594;first, i will just say that i agree with you, that those bottlers are doing really well. germany is certainly a star in europe. southeast asia bottlers are doing well, particularly vietnam, the big one that we are running. i think it is important to keep in mind for you that germany was not in a position to be re-franchised until after 2012, because the consolidation was still taking place. it is really been ready for the last, i feel like 18, 24 months. it has been the real bright spot in europe the last couple of years. it is profitable. we need to ensure that we find the right home and the right structure and the right value. and so i could be clear with you that germany is not a strategic long-term holding, and the right home will be found. none of our, if you like, [big] operations are in a way long-term strategic holds. that is what i would say about your question. irial, you want to add anything to that? the only add i would give is the three markets you mentioned actually are not in a hospital ward. to muhtar's point, actually they are all performing very well now. we have been very transparent about re-franchising. i've said this many times at conferences that we would re-franchise at the right time. germany, we've clearly said is ready for re-franchising. in the meantime, it continues to perform exceptionally well. we have a fantastic group of associates and management in germany, and feel very good about it. i have also said we expect to get a fair price. not get overpaid, but get a fair price for territory because we owe that to our shareholders. we take it from there. just to build on what irial said, we are looking for three things in terms of the right partner, description of the right partner: one, proven management team SEMICOLON two, strong financial capabilities SEMICOLON and three, willing to invest in the business and grow the business. those are the three things. i am confident that we will reach that goal. finally, on your question regarding head count reduction, i think you have heard about our previously announced plan, and we are sticking to that plan, simply said.
30;13;71;0;0.0;ian, it is muhtar. it fits right into the strategy of what we said is bolt-on acquisitions where they make sense, and we will look at them, and where we believe that they fit into our portfolio, where they actually add value. we can generate value for our bottling partners through that acquisition, and it fits right in there, and so that is all i would say about that, ian.
30;14;85;0;0.0;our equity income is impacted by currency. we actually do not pull out all of the currency that impacts that because if you think about some of our locations, they have, their geography, they have many geographies. when we report, we take the main currency, and translate that into us dollars. that means that there is still often a lot of currency impact in those numbers. i would read into it that it is a very, very difficult currency environment out there at the moment.
30;15;15;0;0.0;no, there is nothing one-off that i'm aware of in the equity holdings.
30;16;0;0;NA; .
30;17;84;2;0.023809523809523808;i guess, bill, the way i'd think about it is if you take our unit case sales of one and use that as a surrogate, because that does not have the extra days in it, and you take pricing of three, (inaudible) pricing, and then i would say that did benefit from positive geographic mix. that will moderate over the back half of the year, so i guess i would think of it using this price mix and average unit sales, unit cases.
30;18;45;0;0.0;the operating expenses, i would say no, there was nothing specific in operating expenses that was helped by the 6 days. then the sales and distribution expenses are impacted by the 6 days so they wash out, and i would say there is nothing there.
30;19;105;1;0.009523809523809525;again, i hate to keep repeating myself, but then we did benefit from the size of the geographic mix, so i think the only thing i would say in terms of it will moderate in the back half of the year. we will get more of our normal run rate of negative geographic mix from concentrate shipments. then sandy talked about the impact of the business mix with the food service business in north america. i think those are the things that basically would say that that number will moderate over the back half of the year, as we are still in a transition year.
30;20;41;0;0.0;yes, there is no issue there. we always expected it to close in the first quarter. then basically just the regulatory process that we have to go through that is delaying the close. we fully anticipate that it will close. certainly.
30;21;0;0;NA; .
30;22;94;2;0.02127659574468085;hi, judy. on the structural, the structural is impacted by the timing of the monster transaction. then any time we accelerate into the re-franchising, that is also going to impact our numbers. that is why we gave you different structural guidance. then on the re-measurement gain, yes, that is basically, where we re-measured that euro debt, that impacted currency positively, and so that is what changed the outlook for currency over the back half of the year, and also the impact of venezuela and change, using the simadi rate going forward.
30;23;84;0;0.0;the distribution is starting to transition. it has not fully transitioned. that transition will take place over the year, and so at various times, that is not something that is really under our control. that is really under monster's control, as they transition that. we put an estimate of how we think it is going to transition, so it is not something that is already into our numbers. that is what is slowing up, slower than expected. we expected it to start earlier.
31;1;710;27;0.038028169014084505; , john. it's muhtar here. i'll just say a few top line remarks about it, and then also ask both sandy and ahmet to give some more specific details on their -- in specific markets. i'd say overall, pleased with our initial results. but as we've previously discussed and as i have just recently said, it takes some time, anywhere from 12 to 18 months to realize the full value in terms of a return on those investments. we've found that disciplined quality marketing investments drive growth better than any other strategy or action. we're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the incremental media investment, and also have improved the quality of marketing in our case. the marketing investments in north america is a great point. which is a real contributing factor in the strong performance in the quarter, continued strong performance in north america. and the performance is getting better, with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% price mix. that price mix, and that volume and that, therefore, growth in organic revenue would not have been achieved clearly without the infusion of that marketing and the quality and the quantity. in china, also seeing positive trends, strong marketing activation, as i mentioned in my remarks. sparkling growing at 7%, (inaudible) coke growing at double digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain -- continue to gain significant share in that market. and additionally, we're seeing accelerated trends in our value sharing gains where you compare them against our trends a year ago. so with that said, clear that it'll take some time for the full benefit on a quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up. also challenging consumer environments and macro environments. and so those are really what i would say. and in terms of our results, you see year to date, our marketing investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. so i think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confident that we can -- that we will continue to see more positive results. with that, let me turn now for some more specifics to sandy and then to ahmet for international example. thanks, muhtar. and , john. the core driver of our business across the world over time is the quality and quantity of our advertising, and the related execution and activation by our bottlers. and in the us over the past 18 months, we've vigorously pursued that strategy, increasing our advertising spend significantly. and you're seeing the payoff in the top line results that muhtar just went through. but underneath that, a metric that you can watch also is just the price elasticity of our brands, and how volume reacts to price over time. and it's a good metric of the payoff of advertising, along with the efforts of our bottlers in the marketplace. as we look ahead, we see advertising as an important proactive item to grow the business. but as you start to see in north america over the past few quarters, we're now leveraging the p&l so that the infusion of advertising is coming from the accelerated top line growth and expense efficiency across the total business. so net-net, it's part of our outgoing algorithm, and an important part of the way we intend to drive growth going forward. ahmet? thanks, sandy. hey, john. we have a very similar story in coke international. the bottlers and our teams have strong conviction about how better and more advertising drives top line. the example that muhtar quoted, there's more depth to that. i would add developed markets such as germany and spain to that list. i would add a developing market such as mexico to that list. i would add an emerging market such as nigeria, as good examples. and there are other examples where we increased media, and we improved the quality of that communication, revenue results improved. having said that, the history of this increase is less than a year for most coke international markets. i would caution that it is early days, but definitely we're seeing the positive examples of this action.
31;2;239;0;0.0;sure, steve. on the share buybacks, basically, we've given the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, so we're still in that range. we looked at where we were for the first half of the year, and then we looked at cash, particularly because of the currency getting worse in the back half, and just tightened the range. so basically, we're still in that range and that corridor. we just tightened the range. and then on the second question on productivity. we have basically stated that we are about $500 million for the year -- we are on track. the working capital has allowed us to basically focus on share repurchase, even with the significant currency headwind. so on our productivity initiatives, we are on track. we did not give specific initiatives that we were working on for this year. you know about the people initiatives that we had, and we said we're going to be on target with the $500 million for this year. they're still coming from the three areas, so we're still actively working on reducing our cost of goods sold and moving d&e from more promotional activities into media spend. so we are basically on track. i do not how -- i can not give you any other specifics other than, we are basically on track for the $500 million that we anticipated that we would have for this year.
31;3;286;4;0.013986013986013986;i do not know that i can quantify how they come throughout the year. part of it was dependent upon when we started to see movement with some of the people. and we've not gotten -- for instance, europe had to focus on the working -- had to work with the work council, so their initiative was people really just starting, although everybody is aware the movement of people is just starting. so part of that will be coming out now that they've been able to focus on their moving people initiative. but i do not know that i can quantify the how and when it all comes through, because we focus on dealing with the work first. and we deal with the work first, and then a lot of the other impact will rail making sure that we deal with -- that the organization is appropriately set up for success going forward. which included focusing on the global organization, and restructuring how we worked with the global organization. so all i can say is, we're on target with everything that we've done. just adding to what kathy mentioned, steve. i'd say that also in terms of simplifying our organization, wiring our business units closer and more directly to the functional centers in our company, that has largely taken place. we have essentially eliminated a functional layer in the company, allowing us to make faster and quicker decisions -- and more effective decision making in the company. that is already largely in place. and i think lots of continued work streams going on in cogs that will continue to benefit, and help us to deliver more than the $500 million in savings for the year.
31;4;267;2;0.00749063670411985;first, mark, . on the asia pac, i think it pretty much came in line with what we were expecting and it's related to timing. it's related to how you look at it on a year-to-date basis. and i'll have ahmet comment on that once i finish. i'll just say a few things about the second question. in terms of scale m&a and bolt-on m&a, i think you need to think we will be again looking at bolt-on targets that fit our strategic portfolio. that's the way you should think about our continued interest in any m&a and how we target m&a. just the same way as you've seen us look at it in the last three, four, five years, how we look -- how the acquisitions that we made in terms of innocent, in terms of honesty, in terms of [zeco], in terms of other bolt-on. and then more recently, the announcement from china that we had. so essentially, bolt-on acquisitions that complement our current portfolio and that give us the ability to also scale it up from a geographic scale goes up from a geographic point of view. just like you saw us launch smartwater in other new european markets more recently. that's a good example of how the scale up continues. and how we've converted -- how we've turned smartwater into one of the leading premium waters in the world, both here in the united states and now in some other new markets. ahmet, comments on asia pacific?
31;5;173;1;0.005780346820809248;it excludes anything. but i'm saying our focus would be -- i think you should assume that it would continue in that area. if there's something that obviously -- the future, none of us know what the future holds. we could never be -- we're always guided by the past. the future is something, and there may come some opportunities that we'll look at. but right now, what i will say to you is, base it on what i've said as the past few years being an indication of the future. mark, just to add on to the price mix on asia pacific, the minus [6%] was not a surprise to us. it was expected, and there was a lot of timing between the first and second quarters. if you look at first half price mix for asia pacific, we're in negative [2%]. which is very much in line with what has been happening in asia pacific due to geographic mix and other channel mix issues. so no surprises there.
31;6;357;12;0.03361344537815126;thanks. i'd say, look, i think north america delivered strong second quarter revenue profit value share performance driven by better increased marketing, better marketing, and a disciplined approach to both volume, price and mix management. few things, mix management is working in our favor. consumer is very much approving the smaller packages. smaller packages are growing much faster than larger packages. smaller packages have a higher nsr per liter, per gallon, whatever per case. and therefore, there's -- that way price driven by -- and the ability to keep the volume where it is and gain the price mix are historic bests in terms of the past quarter performance in the united states. why is that happening? more marketing, and more focus on better marketing as well. so the rate is coming through, mix from transactions and packs coming through. that is the general comment i'd make. and, sandy, if you want to provide more color to this. yes, i absolutely agree with that, dara. and our strategy is, as irial and i said a year and a half ago, we were putting in place a strategy of building strong valuable brands, with accelerated quantity and quantity of marketing. and we were going to take proactive opportunities to get our price in line with the value of the brands, and to lead price up in a consistent and strategic way. working on the development of packages that consumers want, in particular premium packages. and the consumer is pulling very clearly to smaller packages, so they can enjoy the ice cold refreshing taste of one of our beverages but in a portion size that they want. the net effect, as muhtar said, is that we have a benefit from mix but our strategy as we look forward is to continue to lead. we see this strategy of disciplined price pack volume management underneath the brand building of strong powerful brands as a long-term strategy. and we continue to take action across our system every day to reinforce it, to grow our capability, and to continue to grow our business in a very balanced and disciplined way.
31;7;92;6;0.06521739130434782;absolutely. the strategy is very consistent, and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to make the levers work. because our brands are strong and we're investing in them, and because our bottling system is executing very well and we continue to get better. i think one of the mantras in our team, dara, is that we've got the right strategy. but we're just beginning to hit our stride from a capability standpoint, and we have much more opportunity to improve than we have progress made so far.
31;8;402;12;0.029850746268656716;sure, vivien. first out, i'd say the challenge is never taken for granted, but the challenge is broadly very much a us centric one. so let me just preface that, and then have sandy comment on what's happening in the united states. and also comment -- give you some more comment on other diet drinks like coke zero performance and so forth. sure. as we've discussed in several of these calls and in our interactions more one on one, the diet and frozen parts of the food and beverage industry have been struggling for a number of quarters. it's getting into years now. as the consumer -- the us consumer moves really strongly to fresh. it's a good dietary change actually for the country, but the impact on categories, and particularly categories that are appealing to diet oriented positionings has been pretty negative. inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands struggling. coke zero, as muhtar mentioned, grew in the quarter. diet coke continues to struggle. our near-term improvements, though, are we're starting to see the consumer base stabilize. we have an incredible number of very loyal drinkers in diet coke, that love diet coke. and our milestone that we're seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue. to match price and volume, such that diet coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again. as we look ahead, what i would tell you about diet coke is that we believe strongly in the diet coke franchise. diet coke, the brand, is the number one diet beverage in the united states, and it will be for a long time to come. we also are looking at changes in the category. our largest competitor is changing their formula, and they'll be launching that in august, and that will create a lot of buzz in the category. some of it good, as the good science of the safety of non nutritive sweeteners gets out in the marketplace and is reinforced. we are looking at multiple programs, to not only strengthen diet coke but to offer consumers adjacent innovation in the diet coke franchise. and we're excited about the long-term future. but as we say around here, it's work in progress and a lot more work to do, but we still are very optimistic about the long term.
31;9;107;1;0.009345794392523364;hello, bryan. yes. on the margin question, our margins were negatively impacted by currency and by structural. obviously, there's always some negative geographic mix that plays into that. but as you look at our margins and if you look at the specific growth margin, first of all, and if you look at them on a comparable basis, we lost some margin. but then if you take out currency and then you take out structural, then we were at positive margins again. so -- and the issue more is about growth margin, it's not so much about operating margins. when you -- then your second question which was --
31;10;116;1;0.008620689655172414;it's normal in the pacific to have negative geographic mix, just because of the base of the country, japan, and then all of the emerging markets there. so, yes, i would say for the remainder of the year, i would anticipate that we would have negative geographic mix in pacific. ahmet, you want to comment on that? that's definitely not in the numbers that we've seen in the second quarter, but the general trend of around a couple points of to date number. however, we do continue to aggressively implement our more balanced top line growth in terms of price and volumes across the territory, and we are aiming to improve on that.
31;11;432;15;0.034722222222222224;before sandy comments on that, bryan, let me just also say that, also in many parts of the pacific, since your question was somewhat related to the pacific and in terms of geographic mix. i think sparkling and particularly, bryan, coca-cola, again, with things that are happening around advertising and media spend and better quality is getting stronger. whether you take indonesia, or whether you take southeast asia, or whether you take china, sparkling is getting stronger and momentum on sparkling is getting better. and therefore, i think you're also seeing a positive shift in category mix for us that is somewhat countered by continued geographic mix. so i think there's a balance there, and i think we're happy to see that balance coming through. i just want to mention that, that important this year, we see that balance beginning to come through, more favorable balance coming through. and then, sandy, if you want to talk about the smaller packages reference. sure. the growth in north america transactions is healthy. and that's coming from a number of things. but the small packages clearly are driving a tremendous amount of positive growth. some of it is cannibalistic, but the cannibalistic nature of it accrues to higher margins. so the mix shift is positive, and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being driven there. and the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages, that's why they're buying more cokes. our marketing model is about more people, enjoying more cokes, more often for a little bit more money. and that's what we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brands. and what you can see by the mid-teen growth of the smaller packages is they're driving that transaction growth, and transaction performance is positive. so the net effect of it is that it's positive in net-net. the other comment i would make is that we have data in some of our retail partnerships that shows that moms in particular like small packs and are returning to the category to use small packs as a way of giving treats to teenagers and others in the household. and it's a particularly positive thing, because moms can do that with a pack that is not too big. whereas, for many years in the category, we marketed packages that were too big, that were either wasted or over consumed. our package mix no longer does that, and it's one of the reasons why our growth is accelerating.
31;12;172;7;0.040697674418604654;thanks, nik. first thing, i would say to you, as i mentioned in my scripted remarks, that we had a very successful global system meeting back in may. and i see the much more improved engagement, and also commitment by our bottling partners across the board, small, large, asia, europe, latin america, eurasia, and africa, north america. so i'd say to you, it's broad based. and i'd say to you that there's a great deal of excitement that is around our plans, particularly our reinvestment plans, and also great amount of commitment for better execution and more investment on the side of our bottling partners. so as i look at the pipeline of investment, i would say i am much more encouraged today than i was, say, 12 to 18 months ago. and i believe that that's driven by our plans and our -- basically our belief in the future and what is being -- and what is happening is yielding early results. and that is driving that engagement.
31;13;47;0;0.0;no, we'll see it this year, and we will see it at a trend that continues to increase next year and beyond over -- certainly over a three-year period. here in the united states, in latin america, in europe, in asia pacific, in eurasia and africa.
31;14;240;4;0.016666666666666666;so, ali, volume, the algebra is volume times price, is what we generate as revenue. and i think it's good that you ask that question, and it's one of the important elements of the algebra. i think we're encouraged by actions where we basically expect it to be. we're cycling 3%, and we generated 2%. and i think the volatility, as i mentioned in russia on the verge of a recession today, from a macro point of view. or brazil where there's still very significant challenges in disposable incomes. china disposable income levels have not improved significantly. but importantly, improving trends on share, we're at all-time high in many markets. value share, particularly, which is very important, and value share is driven again by the actions that we're taking. so based on your question, have you seen the bottom? i'd say we're about where we expected to be. and we see that what we're doing is continuing to help keep that equation in place at an improving trend. the equation being, if the marketing was not there, the volume would not hold up where it was and the price would not hold up where it was. see it in that respect, both being propped up by the investment that we're putting into the marketplace and those investments being driven by the zero-base work that we're generating.
31;15;126;6;0.047619047619047616;i think you said it. those are continuing to improve. as they improve, they become -- there's more that are getting in line for those assets, and that's a good place to be. and i think that basically we see those are great markets, not just in our hands, but in the right hands. and that's the way we see it. and i think that we are encouraged by the internal plans we have, and i think that that's all i can say right now. but we have -- we're in a place where those -- let's call it this way. the fruit is getting riper. this fruit will never get overripe. it will be good on the tree and off the tree.
32;1;0;0;NA; .
32;2;480;10;0.020833333333333332;yes, thanks for the question. what i would say in general overall is, yes, we're pleased with the quarter and the progress we're making, but lots of more work to do. this is a transition year. when we talked to you about 12 months ago, we outlined to you that with the changes we're going to make that our goal is to get to mid single digit, currency neutral revenue growth for the comparable revenue growth for the company overall. and i think if you look at our progress to date for the first three-quarters of the year, we're at sort of the bottom end of that range, the mid single digit. if you look at where we are in revenue in terms of currency neutral comparable, and what we have posted in this past quarter, the third quarter, you would see us, if you take those numbers that you mentioned in terms of volume growth of 3% and price mix of 3%, at the top end of that range. so, in essence, we're pleased with the progress -- what all the five-point strategy and executing it diligently over the last nine months and even starting at the end of last year has brought us to where we are. and so we feel that -- we've always said the marketing has a lag, the incremental marketing, there's a lag in terms of when we input it and the results that we're getting. but we see that the plan is working, and we certainly see that we're taking a very strategic approach in terms of marketing spend versus optimal levels. consistent quality investment in media continues to be one of the strongest drivers of our business, enabling us to generate that revenue. we look at each market, how many weeks of consumer engagement there is. the goal over time is to apply the right pressure in the right way to each of our brands, and each of the segments that you mentioned, which is developed, developing and emerging. the system alignment in our bottling system is matching our alignments with investments -- i'm sorry, with capabilities, execution, output development, cooler placement, et cetera. so we're pleased with what we see there. and, of course, all of this being said, we have a volatile macroeconomic environment which obviously is not getting any better anytime soon. we realize that the global growth for 2015 is projected to be below last year, and even having said that, the disposable incomes are even lagging the growth rates that are projected. so, yes -- but in general, that's how i would frame your question, and both james and i and kathy believe that the incremental and better marking is certainly giving us the results in terms of the top line currency neutral comparable top-line growth.
32;3;356;5;0.014044943820224719;thanks, steve. what we said again at the beginning of this journey back three, four years ago, is that we said that we have an intention to create a system in the united states that can benefit from the local empowerment in each of the communities in the markets that have built our business so successfully over the last 130 years, the franchise system, the alignment that that brings, the value and trust between us and our bottling partners. but at the same time create the mechanism, so to speak, the processes, flexible processes in the marketplace, whether it be information systems, whether it be the customer management system, so that we can speak with one voice to customers coast to coast in the united states, and the national product supply system. all of those negotiations with our expanding bottlers took some time to achieve. they are all achieved. that's why we're progressing with rapidly with our refranchising program, which is working very well, because when we have those processes in place, we can refranchise with confidence and speed and have the business continue to generate the results and the growth that we are seeing in revenue, particularly in the united states of america. and the united states nonalcoholic beverage business is healthy. it is growing in revenues and dollars and cents, and that's the really important measure -- important element that i want to leave with you. but just to add more color and flavor to the national product supply system question that you had in terms of the governance model, i will ask james to comment further and give you more insights. james? i think just specifically on governance, it's not going to be around unanimity. it's going to be based on the driving of the business case. everyone is committed to doing what is economically the most rational answer for the system. again, when it comes to the national issues, it's not necessarily the management of each local plant which will remain the job of each of the participating bottlers, or ccna. steve, did that address your question?
32;4;87;1;0.011494252873563218;we're not laying out the precise mechanics, but i can tell you that there's not going to be a full consensus required for every decision. it is going to be a large majority, and if they support the economic case, then that's what's going to move forward. we're not creating a system that can become blocked. we're creating a system to focus on the best economics of the system in north america and there are mechanisms for that to go forward.
32;5;1;0;0.0;correct.
32;6;302;6;0.019867549668874173;judy, thanks. this is muhtar. . unit case, as i just said, did grow 4% in the quarter in europe. they were cycling a minus 5% from prior year, and sparkling was up as well as stills growing faster than sparkling in western europe. then our concentrate sales did trail also the unit cases in western europe as it did for the whole company. and i'll ask -- and we were pleased with the results and certainly, again, some early results from the marketing, but more to come. and i will ask james to add more color to that. james? thanks, muhtar. as muhtar referenced, we were cycling a pretty poor quarter from last year, so i think it was a favorable comparison. we had strong results from very favorable weather in the southern and the central part of europe. but i would not read too much into the one quarter. i think if you look at the longer-term trends, you can see that we're getting some volume growth in the year to date where the price mix is bouncing around flat. i think it's important to recognize two things as it comes to price mix in the case of europe. one is the general deflationary nature of the european market. retail pricing is zero to one, at best in general. and then secondly, it's worth remembering that the starting point of pricing in europe is, in comparison to the us, higher. so the opportunity is to drive price mix on a sustained long-term basis. in a sense we've already captured some of that in europe, and we will be chasing that in the us. so i do not think we'll see the same sort of price mix over time in europe given our starting points.
32;7;1;0;0.0; , brian.
32;8;215;1;0.004651162790697674;sure, thank you, bryan. so the foreign exchange for next year, if you remember, we had said that for our hard currencies we are hedged, and so our real exposure is around our emerging currencies. that being said, we do have to cycle that euro debt bond offering which impacted the first and second quarter of this year, and for the full year it was about 3 points benefit to us. so we do have to cycle that next year on top of the change in the rates and probably a more difficult currency environment going forward. so we will give more color on currency in february when we give our full-year results for 2016. but our issue is really going to be around the emerging markets where we've just -- it's not cost effective to hedge more than about a quarter at a time. and then in terms of the structural impact, yes, germany will be a structural impact next year. obviously we continue with the north american refranchising, so that will still have a significant impact in north america. and there may be some slight impacts from whenever the things -- africa closes -- the africa transaction closes. but the majority of it will be the germany transaction and the north america refranchising.
32;9;48;0;0.0;yes, i want to -- bryan, this is muhtar. what i'll say is it's in the regulatory approval process, and that's all i would say right now. we expect it to close sometime over the next three to four months. that's what i would say.
32;10;302;4;0.013245033112582781;sure. so the unit cases to concentrate shipment, they were really impacted by asia pacific and latin america. if you look at latin america on a year-to-date basis, they are absolutely in line. and with asia pacific, on a year-to-date basis we expect them to be generally in line. so there's really no story there in terms of that gap. when you -- moving on to productivity, so productivity initiatives, obviously we are seeing some benefit from productivity. in our margins, there is an impact in our margins from basically the structural changes. so if you were to exclude structural changes, gross margins and operating margins would be higher, and you would see margin expansion. when you look at the third quarter, when you look at the leverage, so we are getting some productivity, but we also have an impact from timing of the dme from-- basically from prior years that's impacting that timing from this year, that, by the way, turns around in the fourth quarter. so i think there are a lot of puts and takes going on around productivity. you are seeing some productivity coming through. we are continuing to reinvest behind our brands, though. but our margin expansion is masked right now by currency and structural. so if you pull those two things out, you see very good margin expansion. and i would just add one point, ali. i think what we saw in this past quarter in terms of operating margin expansion on a currency neutral comparable basis of about 100 basis points, we were pleased with that expansion. now, the key is to do everything we can to continue and ensure that we execute fully on the five strategic points going forward so that we can continue to improve our trajectory.
32;11;26;0;0.0;we will not comment on any specific matters related to our customers, bottlers, or any m&a matters. so i would just leave it at that.
32;12;293;2;0.006825938566552901;john, this is muhtar. actually they're not in conflict at all. they're basically very complementary to our strategy which is to ensure we have the local touch, and we have also the scale, and we have the processes to meet customer demands and customer partnerships. and in the united states we've actually not -- you mentioned the word fragmented. we have a national customer management system. we have a national production system. we have a national information system that is basically all with their own governance models, and they're very fluid and very flexible to suit the needs of the business today. and then at the same time, every piece of the united states that has those elements really have enough size for scale. and then we have the much smaller, the smaller distributor bottling system that also the smaller guys are doing a great job in growing the business for us. and then in europe, basically what we have is the customer landscape in europe is much, much more concentrated in western europe where just a handful of customers account for a very large portion of the total future consumption, the retail business in europe. and, therefore, when you look at what we have created in western europe, it basically suits our future needs in terms of working proactively with our customer partners and also it gives the scale and also it gives the local touch in each of the markets. so from that perspective, just like what we've done in japan, just like what we've done in south africa, in large markets i'm talking about, it basically very much aligns to our strategy in how you think about what we're doing in the marketplace.
32;13;166;1;0.006024096385542169;well, the customer base in the united states and western europe is very, very different in terms of how it's structured. and so we follow the customer -- the needs of the customer, what matters. we follow the scale SEMICOLON we follow the necessity for speed. and we feel that the model that is being created in western europe will serve us very well for the next decade and beyond. and the same thing goes for the united states. it is proving that it is serving us very well in terms of getting us to scale, in terms of getting us the costs in production and cost of goods sold, but at the same time retaining the local touch and retaining the local element that is really important in our business. both of those are valid for europe and for western europe and for japan and for south africa and for the united states, or wherever else you are seeing us create a better bottling system.
32;14;0;0;NA; .
32;15;256;7;0.02734375;well, i think based on what we're seeing is we're able to generate revenue growth both in the sparkling category very much so, as well as in the still side, and, therefore, that's what my comment referred to. this is not just one quarter, this is multiple quarters. at the same time, inside that lrb category that is showing very good resilience in terms of both price elasticity, price discipline, approach with customers, generating value for our customers, both in the sparkling side, as well as large and small customers in the still side, we're also seeing that this is the 22nd consecutive quarter of us gaining value share in the marketplace in north america. and then the mix is really working for us in terms of generating the marketing where the north american market is the first market where we've started employing incremental marketing, better marketing is generating also positive results for us in terms of the revenue growth from sparkling derived, particularly -- purely from sparkling as well as from the still side of the business. james, do you want to add any color to that? yes, i think, if you take a look at how we're driving the sparkling business, you can look at the transaction packages which represent about 15% of the volume, and they're growing still again this quarter into double digits. so we're very pleased with the marketing and the obpc approach is driving positive revenue growth for sparkling on a consistent basis.
32;16;221;1;0.004524886877828055;so, of course, we need to wait and see whether the recent vote produces the [act of] law by the end of the process. it's only gone through one of the stages, so we'll see where that ends up. obviously, we are in favor of reductions in discriminatory taxes. i think as we look out on how that has impacted the world and how that's being viewed, and it will be used as a case study around the world, the data we have so far is the impact of the tax was to bring down about six calories from the mexican diet by the end of the process. so we're conscious that obesity is a crisis, we know we need to play a role. we do not think this is the silver bullet that anyone was looking for, and we think that much more work needs to be done if, indeed, a solution is to be brought to bear on the whole obesity crisis, which overconsumption of anything, including soft drinks, would be a contributor and a part of the problem. so we'll see where this tax ends up. clearly taxing diets and [lights] does not seem to be the right way forward, and, therefore, if this measure goes through, i think it would be positive.
32;17;217;5;0.02304147465437788;yes, i mean, nik, i'll just say, very broadly, at a high level, we're pleased with our performance in china. obviously a lot of noise around china these days, but we have, as mentioned earlier in the script, we have an all-time high share for brand coke in china and we're growing in china and we're gaining share in china and we're investing in china. and the same goes for india, two of the very large markets in asia, certainly pleased with the results there. we had some weather-related issues in the quarter before, but we're coming back, the business is really coming back and performing much better in india. so overall, i think -- and then in japan we're seeing some green shoots in terms of disposable incomes. we're very early still to call it any color. but overall, i'd say -- and then obviously, back in south -- australasia, the economy was very much related to commodities, and it has suffered, and we're seeing the macro spillover from that. but i would say, overall, in this past quarter, we're happy with the results of the big economies, and recognizing that we've got more work to do. and that's how i would leave it.
33;1;1;0;0.0; , bill.
33;2;2;1;0.5;great, thanks
33;3;346;14;0.04046242774566474;yes, thanks bill. ever since i took over as ceo, i've always emphasized the importance of our franchise model. one of my clear priorities was to accelerate growth in our biggest profit pool, the united states. we bought the business of cce us operations with that goal in mind. when you think about it, now we've been able to prove to ourselves we can accelerate the business in north america. we've had the best year in 2015. you saw the results from the quarter. these results show our strategic focus on driving consumption of smaller package sizes is continuing to pay off. transactions are growing. price mix is healthy. bringing those two things together, both the goal of going back, returning to our core model, which we've always emphasized -- even the first time we announced the purchase of cce's us operations, we said there will be a role for partnerships going forward, as soon as we can put some things right. we have got the three legs of the stool in place: the customer governance, production governance, and the it platforms. we feel very confident. we have proven to ourselves that we can do it, and we feel very confident that this is the time. the new model is established, bottler performance is improving. we have a new structure to last us the next number of decades, and we've put the bottlers -- we're putting our bottlers in the right hands. as kathy said, the bottlers a very healthy, and thanks to the great leadership and capability of our bottling investment group. yes, we are now going to the core. this is the time, and we feel very confident that we can do the two things together -- accelerate momentum and bring the franchising to a bookend that really we feel is going to be very beneficial, both to our company, our share owners, as well as leading to better customer service and better value creation on the bottler side. it's really a win-win from all those perspectives, bill.
33;4;1;0;0.0; , bonnie.
33;5;650;11;0.016923076923076923;sure, bonnie. i'll say a few words, and then i'll let kathy and james comment, too. i'll say that certainly we have the proof point in the united states. our chinese business, for example also, is giving us great -- has great momentum, gaining share, and growing in that difficult environment, if you look at the quarter, if you look at the full-year results. the capability that has been put into place in all of our expanding bottlers everywhere is really giving us the confidence. also, just look at the momentum of the business. our revenue growth was a priority. we've got it up to the 4% to 5% range. the increased marketing is working, clearly. now better marketing is even going to enhance that. at the same time, we feel that every time the territory has transitioned, it's actually continued to do well, continued to gain share, continued to drive momentum, continued to drive incremental transactions. from that, any of the territories in the last four, five quarters that have been transitioned, we've seen without exception that to be holding true. if you look at all these bottlers that we re-franchised, look at the performance of our german bottler. it really has the greatest momentum and the confidence of europe right now. all of these bottlers are going in to a system, to a structure, to an architecture, to a geography that will continue to do even better when you combine it and when you create the synergies with the combination. we feel confident. what took a little while to get right was the governance model around production in the united states, the governance model around the it platform, the governance model around the customer service. all those are in place and working well. i'll hand over to james to add some flavor to that and more details, and then kathy can comment also on your questions related to the financial aspect of the cash. bonnie, let me add one thought to what muhtar's laid out there on we've been fixing and building and we're finding the right partners. a simple way of looking at why it's working is there's just more people coming to the table saying we want to be partners. our existing partners want more territories, and new people who are not in the system want to get into the system. they are seeing we fixed the business and we've built momentum, and so there's a lot of heightened interest in being part of a growing coke system, particularly in north america. okay, bonnie i think the last part of your question you asked about the incremental dilution and the impact of that, as helping with the impact of that. for 2016 we gave you the impact. for 2017 we are doing several things, because we know you all have lots of questions about 2017. we are going to provide revised operating segment financial information later in the quarter. at cagny, we're going to give you a look at what to anticipate the business will look like after everything is finished in 2018, because the actual dilution depends really on the timing of these transactions. the best way we can give you some indication of that is really to help you understand what our business will look like when everything is said and done in 2018 and beyond, which is what we're going to try to do at cagny. i would ask you just hold off on that, and more to come on that. on your question about cash, we -- the cash will basically go into basically our capital structure and be part of our normal mix. at this point, no board-level decisions have been made. we anticipate these proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet.
33;6;494;25;0.05060728744939271;thanks, dara. as i mentioned, we're pleased with our market-share performance, value share gains across the world. i'll let james highlight some details on that. yes, thanks muhtar. dara, let me give you a quick run around the world in terms of share. firstly, on an overall global basis, perhaps consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in the fourth quarter than we had in the whole year, so a better performance at the tail end. in terms of how that played out across the world, you see again in line with the volume performance, strong results in north america. we gained share in sparkling, we gained share in still, and we gained share overall in the quarter and in the year. good momentum in north america coming through in share. in europe we're gaining share in sparkling and in stills. given our different starting point, that's netting out to being flat overall SEMICOLON but we've got a strong growth in europe as we build our stills business. latin america, this is a long-term track record of success, so small gains there, building on a long history of building a great position. eurasia, despite some of the volatility in that part of the world we gained share in both sparkling and stills, and overall pretty strong momentum there in terms of share. then in asia-pacific we focused more on re-staging and re-energizing the sparkling business where we're gaining share. we lost a little bit in stills and overall flat. i think wherever you look around the world, we're largely flat to gaining, so inconsistent with our volume growth, which is broad-based and across the world, we're also larger winning across the world. in terms marketing pay-back, what you are seeing is there is results in the marketing pay-back. our revenue in 2015, organic revenue growth in 2015 was better than 2014. we're guiding for a good number that's ahead of 2015 in 2016. we see the marketing pay-out beginning to build the momentum globally. i think if you double down on that one and look under that, north america was one of the first places we started with the incremental marketing, and that's self-evidently building momentum. we see the underlying business results coming through in revenue very much tied to where the extra media money is going. in terms of macro outlook and risk to top line, i think we feel we got underlying structural momentum in the business. now when i said the macro, we are planning on the macros slightly better in 2016, and i really do mean slightly. i would not be surprised if that was the same growth rate in 2015. but we think we have the right portfolio and the rate optionality to be able to deliver our financial numbers in that environment.
33;7;75;0;0.0;for 2017, we are also fully hedged on our major currencies. obviously the emerging market currencies are the ones where you can not really hedge more than a quarter or so out. obviously we have done nothing on the emerging market currencies. on the hard currencies we are hedged at rates slightly worse than in 2016. there will be a slight impact, but it's not -- i would not think it would be terribly significant.
33;8;110;1;0.00909090909090909;the gross margins in the fourth quarter impacted by the six fewer days, and the currency and then the structural impact. if you take all that out, basically, we had good growth margin expansion in the fourth quarter and for the full year. for the balance sheet, basically as we've got so much cash that's outside of the united states, we are taking a little bit more of a conservative approach with our balance sheet. it was just more prudent to manage with the longer-term maturities than with short-term maturities. we still have a robust portfolio of commercial paper. we're just balancing that out differently.
33;9;37;0;0.0;yes, basically it's going to be on the interest expense line. i think we're expecting much more interest expense given the rate changes, but also the longer-term maturities are also causing more interest expense.
33;10;351;9;0.02564102564102564;brett, i think if you look at our overall for the whole year and as well for the quarter our price mix globally, you can see that has improved. as was mentioned, part of the reason for that is we're beginning to see the results of increased marketing play through, as well as our packaging strategies and mix management. coupled with that, the value share gains, which is even more pleasing, given that we're able to get healthy pricing in our business and in our markets around the world. i will let james comment in terms of europe and japan, and what's being seen in some of those developed markets, in addition to the united states. okay? yes, thanks muhtar. i think firstly it's important to remember, starting with europe, that our price positioning in europe, we have over time substantially taken a lot of rate and mix in europe, such that we are more premium priced compared to our competitors than we are in north america -- less runway in that sense. now having said that, we continue to focus on smaller packages, more premium offerings in terms of the brand portfolio, such that despite what is a pretty deflationary retail environment in a number of western european markets, we're getting price mix in europe, both in the quarter and for the full year. i think going out one should not expect the same levels the us has been able to develop, especially given the macro environment in europe at the moment. in terms of japan, we are very focused on rebuilding our ability to get positive price mix in japan. we've recently been able to get some. again, very focused on leveraging both packaging options and the brand portfolio to re-shape it to allow us to drive positive mix. again, i do not think you will see in japan the same sorts of levels as the us, as much as anything to do with the deflationary pressures in japan. but we are starting to see chances of a better pricing environment in japan.
33;11;1;0;0.0; , bryan.
33;12;43;0;0.0;certainly. we will lose about $500 million of productivity, primarily out of cost of goods sold. again, we are committed to making up that lost amount, and we're going to make it up between cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and dme.
33;13;65;3;0.046153846153846156;well, we always said we were going to continue to look for additional productivity opportunities, and we have done just that. we've learned a lot about our costs as we have continued the programs -- zbw, as well as other cost-optimization programs. basically we've looked end to end, and we were able -- we saw additional opportunity, and we're going to take it.
33;14;68;0;0.0;no, i think it will be captured by the system. we're even hoping they can find additional areas, bryan, to even increase that going forward. part of the whole plan around the production governance is also to ensure that we can actually lever and pull more synergies out of our production system in the entire template of north american production. yes, the answer is a definite yes.
33;15;3;0;0.0;that's right.
33;16;267;3;0.011235955056179775;sure. let me start with the price mix in asia-pacific. i think the most important thing to know here is because the different geographies in the asia-pacific group have quite different pricing, and concentrate shipments can be lumpy, you do get some erratic price mix numbers on a quarterly basis. that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in asia-pacific. there were more shipments to somewhere like india than japan. you can actually see the flip side of this in the eurasia group, where we get very strong price mix in the fourth quarter, which was the flip side. we had more shipments to places like south africa than the middle east. this is all about country mix. i think it's important for particularly those two groups, asia-pacific and eurasia, to look at some longer-term four-quarter trend line on price mix, given the very impactful country mix issue, and the lumpiness of concentrate shipments. that's the key thing there. in terms of china, clearly not as much as we would have liked to have grown in china in the first quarter. i think that the environment in china is pretty clearly having slowed down. but we think we had a strong momentum over the last couple of years coming back into china. we're looking to do better in 2016, but we do not actually provide country-based forecasts. what i would say, however, is we're continuing to do very strongly in terms of share, particularly in sparkling, as we have re-energized that business.
33;17;705;10;0.014184397163120567;yes, steve. related to juice and hot-fill and stills, stills continues to perform very well in north america for us. the template for stills production is completely different in terms of how it's configured to cold-fill. therefore -- and juice is an integrated business. given those aspects, we intend that for the future to not change the structure related to both hot-fill as well as to juice and our food service business all will remain as integrated in that respect. they're doing very well, and we feel they add value to the overall structure of north america. they're an important strategic part of how we move forward and continue to make increase momentum in north america. india -- look, you saw that number. given all these changes we're announcing, basically if you brought it back to 2015 the total bottling assets that we would have under our management and on our balance sheet would actually go down from 18% of the total mix globally to about 3%. yes, india there are opportunities in other parts of the world remaining, but it's a very small template based on where we are. we'll look at opportunities. as james said earlier, one of the litmus tests i've always said, one of the great litmus tests for the health of the coca-cola business is the desire of investors and franchise partners to have more territory -- that's at an all-time high. remains that -- we expect that to remain high, and therefore there may be other opportunities in the remaining geographies. but i can not comment on that any further right now. then i'll pass it over to james to take you through the longer-term question on portfolio stills versus sparkling, and then kathy the question of 4% , 5% organic growth volume versus price. james? sure. look, i think our aspiration is to have both of them growing, both sparkling and stills. that's what we achieved in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2015. now i think in a total portfolio sense, much in the same way it's happened over the last decade or so, we've gone from about 10% of the portfolio being stills to roughly 25% of the portfolio being stills. i think mathematically the stills will grow as a percent of total portfolio. i would note, as muhtar commented earlier, i think we need to break out the stills, and not just look at them as one thing, but look at them in terms of their individual categories. we gained share in packaged water. we gained share in juice and juice drinks. we gained share in energy, and we gained share in ready-to-drink tea. we think we can do well in each of the categories that represent non-alcoholic ready-to-drink. in particular, we can still grow sparkling. that growth of sparkling into the future is not just in aggregate SEMICOLON but i think over the long-term we will see increased growth of low-, no-, and reduced-calorie variants. i know that's not the case yet in north america, but globally in our international business, those drinks out-grow the regular drinks within sparkling, and they're fueling our growth, so broad-based growth. okay. on your question of 4% to 5% organic growth, volume versus price mix, we expect that to be balanced, volume versus the price. as you know, we have the strategy where we are now focused more on net revenue and segmenting our markets, and we're focused on price realization. we do anticipate that strategy will continue, and that will be a balance between both volume -- and we will achieve a balance between both volume and price. as advertising and promotions -- in 2014 we announced this program. we said $800 million to $1 billion that we would invest. we are still going to invest -- continuing to invest behind our brands on that program, although we're also going to start investing in r&d. basically, we're still on our program we announced back in 2014, so you will continue to see investment in marketing slightly above gross profit.
33;18;532;9;0.016917293233082706;well ali, let me start with the last first. when we announced the acquisition of cce, it was essentially a 25-year-old problem. we said it would take a while to basically course-correct. the level of investment was not where it was needed. also, the level of customer service was not where it was needed. essentially, we believe that having more than just one bottler essentially having that big a territory was a better way -- scalable-size bottlers, right ownership values, right structure and right capability. that's what we have today in north america. we feel very good that this is a model that is going to stay where it is and continue to add value. it's not going to require any further -- all the time they'll be tweaking necessary, but not the scale that was needed when we did the transaction back at the end of 2010. that was a core decision that was needed. there was a major surgery that was needed, and that's really what took place. as far as the juice business is concerned, as i said before, it's an integrated business. it basically performs well as an integrated business, similar to other juice businesses that we have around the world. it's a very different model, it's a very different production, it's a very different growth to table model, and requires a different way in terms of its distribution, especially when it's chilled. that's really where a lot of the growth is in value-added dairy. that's what you see, whether it's in fairlife or that's what you see whether it's in juice. it's a very distinct production model, very different, as well as the hot-fill is also the same. same within a sense in europe, the same with many parts of the world. [kukustevayey] is also very similar in terms of the way it's produced. that is just a needed aspect for success and for performance in the hot-fill and juice business -- very different. to your other question related to dilution from franchising, maybe i'll pass it over to kathy. certainly. we've given you guidance for 2016. 2017, it totally depends on timing. we plan to give you more information to help with that, with your modeling, between cagny and what we will give you before the end of the quarter. it's all based on timing. in 2018, you asked when will we grow out of this. the program -- we plan to complete the program by the end of 2017, so 2018 we are out of it. yes, and our long-term outlook -- just to add for the industry -- remains very positive, ali. our system is extremely well positioned to take advantage of this. we're going to be a much more focused company. we're going to be building brands, leading the system, and driving new growth platforms. our core business will have attractive growth going forward, in terms of roic, free cash flow, and so forth. we're very confident and very excited about where the company is going from that aspect.
33;19;120;0;0.0;basically, 2018 obviously we will be -- there will be some dilution effect because of the -- we have -- the base has not been totally adjusted by that time. once we get the base adjusted, short of other structural impacts -- which will not be north america re-franchising, obviously -- but other structural impact, we will have quote gone through that re-franchising impact. now we do have some residual costs that will come out, as i said, throughout 2016, 2017. there will be a little bit left in 2018. certainly by mid to late 2018 even the residual costs will be gone. i think once the base is reset, short of other types of structural impacts, we will have transitioned through that.
33;20;181;5;0.027624309392265192;ali, it's james here. look, i think in the us business we did reasonably well in growing coke zero, or getting coke zero back to flat, and there's still a decline in diet coke. i think the bigger picture is in the 80% of our business which is the international business, the diets and lights and coke zeros out-grew coke classic. we're seeing broad-based growth outside the us of those coca-cola variants. that's what gives us the belief that in the long term we will be able to turn around the business also in the us. to finally add on that, ali, also with our recently announced one-brand approach to marketing trademark coke, we are extending the strong brand equity of coca-cola across the trademark to offer consumers more choice, and to also better promote our great-tasting diet and light portfolio, which is going to no question help. i think that's going to also help us with the stability that is the target. i'll just leave it at that.
34;1;0;0;NA; .
34;2;508;13;0.025590551181102362;hi, john. it's muhtar here. i'll just preface by saying the following, and then pass over to james. first, you know how much we've done and how much we focus on creating successful brands in our still portfolio. of the $20-billion brands we have now, 14 of them are still brands, and our still business is performing well. whether we take value-added dairy or enhanced hydration or juices and nectars or juice drinks, we play in all of those categories. in 2015, we gained share in all of those categories. if you look at how -- whether it's in developed markets or emerging or developing, our still beverage portfolio is being enhanced all the time. also, and even in the case of waters and premium waters from japan all the way through to latin america, performing very well. you just heard now again, we've invested in -- we just recently invested, as you know, in suja in the united states. we invested in chi and culiangwang in china. we continue to always reference that wherever we look, and if there's opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions, we will look at those favorably. if there are also opportunities for organic development of brands like fair life, we will certainly look at those also favorably, as we have done. i think we're very satisfied with our portfolio. certainly we've got more work to do, as we have said in the call and in the remarks SEMICOLON but right now we feel that we've -- our portfolio is being transformed very well, and transitioned very well, and we are in a pretty good place -- and more work to continue. james? let me add one last thought, perhaps, john. at cagny, we talked about we have a 50 share of sparkling, and a 15 share of the stills. i think it's worth remembering that over the last 15 years we've gone from stills being less a single-digit part of our portfolio to now over 25% of our portfolio. i think there's a long-term track record of generating growth and value in stills. even given today our market position, we expect to continue to grow faster in stills. as we said in the call, we are gaining share in every sub-category apart from one where we held it. we'll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate our growth. i think it's going to continue to be a faster-growing part of the business. also, just on the sparkling you asked, we certainly see also continued growth opportunities in our sparkling portfolio. that is naturally with the focus on revenues, it will skew more towards revenues, but certainly also as we have demonstrated and with our new campaign for taste the feeling campaign just being launched, and everything else that we are doing in terms of the investments with our aligned partners, we see growth opportunities in revenue, and also in volume in our sparkling beverage portfolio.
34;3;156;3;0.019230769230769232;hi, steve, it's muhtar. first, i think we did expect the first quarter to trend slightly below the full year, driven by a couple of things. one, the macros are trending to the bottom -- toward the bottom in the first quarter, recognizing that the environment continues to be challenging, but we will continue to monitor that closely. the launch of our new campaign in the first quarter will certainly benefit the back half of the year. the benefit of olympics marketing as we move into the second and third quarter, one less selling day which certainly you also mentioned. i think we are confident definitely in the strategy and initiatives in place to support our growth targets over the course of the year, and believe that we will land again in the corridor that we have stayed at in the past in february. james or kathy, do you want to add anything? no. all right.
34;4;148;2;0.013513513513513514;sure, mark. there are really -- we look at the margins in ccr, the three primary drivers for what you're seeing. first of all, we have shifted some of the territories. we have transitioned some territories to date. we did that obviously before we put the financials out there earlier this quarter. then if you remember, we incurred back in early 2010, 2011, 2012 time period, there was a significant hit to us from a run-up in commodity prices that certainly adversely impacted margins. then the third thing i would say was we had to incur incremental costs to prepare that business for now being ready to be franchised and to strengthen that business. i think what we're seeing is improvement in the results that i would say today. those three things really are impacting what you saw in the financials that we put out there.
34;5;19;0;0.0;it's james here. look, volume grew 2%. core price mix was 2%, so that's the right answer.
34;6;198;3;0.015151515151515152;judy, it's james here. a couple of things on europe. one, it is worth noting that in this quarter, there was a disruption to the business in gb due to the supply chain. there's a one-off impact that we expect to see not recurring in the balance of the year. i think that's worth taking into account, and it was a material impact. now looking for the rest of the year, you will see in the numbers we had pretty decent price mix in europe in this quarter, and we are also looking to see volume improving versus the fourth quarter -- not just because of the supply situation, but also the new programs, the launch of the new marketing campaign, the launch of a new coke zero variant starting in gb, plus the euro cup, which will be in france this year. of course, shortly we will hopefully complete cc coca-cola european partners, where there are very strong plans being put in place to drive that forward. i think some temporary factors, and the build-up of our ongoing investments should drive a better result in europe in the balance of the year.
34;7;192;0;0.0;sure, james here. let me -- i'll come to the numerical piece. let me start off with -- the asia-pacific price mix is always a little bit of an oddity, because it's a group that brings together japan and australia, which are very high-revenue markets, but do not grow as quickly, along with a lot of emerging markets -- not just china, but india, indonesia, and the philippines, which grow much faster. there is an ongoing mechanical effect that creates a negative price mix for this group, which you can see over the years in asia-pacific. in 2013 full year it was minus 4%. in 2014, it was minus 2%. in 2015, it was minus 2%. in the first quarter of 2016 obviously it was minus 5%, but it was cycling a very atypical plus 3% in the first quarter of last year. i think what you will see is in the future quarters, it is a little volatile and bumpy, but the long-term trend is for a negative price mix in asia, because of the dynamic of the fast growth of the emerging markets versus japan and australia.
34;8;400;5;0.0125;ali, i'll start just by saying, as i indicated, first on the core, with one less selling day and on the core price mix of the core business without big, we certainly did get to the 4% in this quarter. what we feel looking at the downhill comparisons and looking at also all the programs in place, looking at how our business performance in all the different quarters and different groups, we feel confident that we still will achieve what we have said in february in terms of the top line for the full year. the marketing program, the additional marketing, the new marketing program that has just been launched, and then not having the one less selling day. then also the continued franchising and all the programs that the bottlers have in place. our us business is performing very well with its revenue growth, with its price mix, with its brands, with its portfolio. that will continue in -- we have every confidence that it will continue. then we will see -- we do believe that macros have -- are at the bottom, and that there will be in the second half a certain degree of improvement in the macros. even if they do not -- if they stay the same, we feel confident with the current macro situation that we will get to the corridor that we have specified, we have indicated and shared with you in february. any other comments, james, kathy? no, i think the one thing i would add, ali, is obviously there's a strong momentum in the north america business. we called that out as the place where the strategies are working. then the other countries i put in the other two buckets, there's degrees of implementation of the strategy. you can go to around the world. there were places which were struggling in 2014, and maybe even in 2015. as we've been executing the strategy, the momentum is starting to come back to some of those countries, and it's starting to build over time. i think, as muhtar said, the first quarter was within the envelope of expectation for our guidance, and we can see based on what we are doing within our control, within a reasonable scenario of macros, we will stay within that corridor for the rest of the year. but in the end, only results will answer the questions.
34;9;134;0;0.0;i think on that, predominantly we have existing bottlers that are expanding, if you look at the percentages of territories that have been franchised. then we have, in order to ensure that we can get to the right level of diversity in our bottling business and the right level of also representation, we have also selected some new partners like in florida, like in chicago, and like now, the most recent one announced. we feel that is a healthy mix and that's also a healthy balance, and we have the right -- very much the right approach and the right alignment with our expanding bottling partners, whether they are just entering our system, or they are proven expanding bottlers like the ones that we have mostly franchised new distribution to in the past year.
34;10;67;0;0.0;certainly, bill. really, the gross margin decline is really impacted by two things, really. it's currency and it's the structural impact. currency, i think like 80 basis points, would have added 80 basis points back to our gross margin. the structural impact actually would add significantly more than that. it's really as simple as that. it's really about currency and our structural adjustments.
34;11;277;5;0.018050541516245487;let me take a bite of that, kevin. i think the answer on the slow-down, we do not get all the category numbers necessarily. clearly, as we're gaining share in that top-line number, there's got to be some weakness in the category versus the long-term target of 5%. i think we talked a little bit about that at cagny, about how our expectations for 2016 and 2017 were below the long-term 5% dollar value for any rtd. there's definitely some of that. i think you can see the macros influencing the industry in the sense that a number of the emerging markets, particularly the commodity ones, where we have had the slow-down, and that's clearly flowing through into the industry. i think what i would highlight is we're going to focus on what we can control. we have a long-standing game plan of what to do in countries that are in crisis, focusing on really gaining a lot of share to set ourselves up profitably for the long-term, as we did in a lot of countries in the past. it seems to be working now as we gain share in the chinas and the russias and brazils. it will pay off in the end. i think the visibility, look, we are managing to our corridors at the top and the bottom line. we feel that this quarter was within the envelope. clearly the macros slightly better, slightly worse, will be an influence in where we end up SEMICOLON but we've got a lot of management left to do in the balance of the year.
34;12;1;0;0.0; . , bill.
34;13;329;8;0.0243161094224924;bill, this is muhtar. we've said from the beginning first that the new campaign is not just a new campaign, but also it's a new strategy in terms of the one-brand strategy, and that it's got many advantages. we expect it to give us significant efficiencies and effectiveness. but also in terms of how we communicate with our consumers, it will certainly play into that as we execute the strategy, and we've now launched the new campaign. then i'll let james comment in terms of you asked the mexico specific example, but also there's also many other places where it's been tested, and tested favorably. go ahead, james. yes, bill, a few thoughts. one, the initial pilot markets, the two sources of very clear impact were one, it helped us expand and grow the zero-calorie variant of coca-cola by driving availability and driving trials. we would expect to see benefits on the zero-sugar variance. the second big area of benefit is it helps us create what we would call corporate blocking. in other words, we execute in stores all the variants of coca-cola together as one big block, has a much greater store impact, visual impact, engagement with people who are shopping the stores. i think slightly more strategically and back to muhtar's point, this is an implementation of a strategic idea. i'm sure we'll evolve it. i'm sure we'll make it better, but it's the strategic idea that's important. it's not just about the efficiency in the advertising. it's about helping consumers join and stay in the coca-cola franchise, whatever the ingredients they want to manage, including their management of added sugars, whether that's in drinks or any other categories that have added sugar in. this has a number of benefits that are going to play out strategically, and we will keep improving the execution.
34;14;0;0;NA; .
34;15;178;1;0.0056179775280898875;one point i would just add, amit, would be that the us compared to the rest of the world, the prevalence of small packages was much less in the united states three or four years ago compared to the rest of the world. if you look at europe and places like spain, or if you look at many countries in latin america, you had much more prevalence of smaller packages then in the united states. in a way, the united states in the last four or five years, but particularly last two and a half years, has moved very rapidly to the 12-ounce glass to the 8-ounce glass to the 7.5-ounce can, to the 8.5-ounce aluminum bottle. that has really worked. those are all growing double digits in the united states because of two -- the consumer customer preferences, and also benefiting our system because they have a higher price per liter. that's in a way playing out from what was already prevailing in many parts of the world in the past.
34;16;0;0;NA; .
34;17;213;2;0.009389671361502348;vivian, i think a couple of things. one, obviously most of our campaigns are weighted into the second, third, and fourth quarters. those are the biggest quarters. even taste the feeling, we announced it this quarter, but it's only really hitting at towards the end of the quarter and rolling out in the rest of the year, as with the euro cup and the olympics. i think a lot of the programs are going in later this year. they -- obviously the execution is there, so we would expect to see better performance in trademark coca-cola going into the downhill. i would make one other note, which is the relative change in where global growth is coming from, or industry growth is coming from -- a little more in developed and developing, a little less in emerging -- tends to create a portfolio effect that weighs a little more against sparkling and therefore coca-cola, because those emerging markets tend to be more sparkling orientated. you see north american, latin america, japan, with stronger stills growth. we do expect to see growth. we would expect to see it coming back. there is a geographic mix impact, but when we look at the markets, we believe we will be back on track with coca-cola.
34;18;206;11;0.05339805825242718;robert, it's muhtar here. i think first, in terms of the efficiencies, the most important benefit will be simpler and less-fragmented communication with the consumer. that will be the biggest benefit. but also, it will certainly help provide -- create more efficiencies and effectiveness in our non-working dme, and therefore will also provide some productivity in that respect. but the most important benefit will certainly be a less cluttered and better and more direct communication with the consumer base. in terms of the trial of product, that will certainly come as a result of that, of what james mentioned in terms of better presence in the store, in terms of better merchandising, in terms of better interruptions in the store, and also in terms of the communication piece. we believe that the most important benefit of this will infuse and will come to brands like coca-cola zero with more availability, better communication, and have the broad perspective of the global campaign, as opposed to every different brand under the coca-cola trademark having their own campaigns. that will be how i think the benefits will come. we -- trials and pilots so far have proven that in europe and other parts of the world.
35;1;764;9;0.011780104712041885;okay. , steve. let me try and get to china, and let me start from the top and work downwards, if i may. firstly, it's clear that when you look at the whole company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise. but given, as you all know, that our bottling business comes with 4 to 5 times more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying cost, any effect on the revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic. in china, it's our largest international bottling operation. we own bottlers that are roughly 20% of the global business. but the business one outside the us is china. so, that's where it's coming from and it's the mechanical impact of being hit in china where we own about one-third of the system that is creating that whole difference between the 3% and 4%. and what we have assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident and clear in our competence going forward, is we have not really assumed that china is going to get better in the rest of the year. if it did, that would be great, but we are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance, but obviously we're working to try and make it better. now, as i said, what's changing as you try to split the difference, what's changing is both the consumer and the supply chain. i think in round numbers from a revenue perspective, you've got about half the impact coming from the consumer and half coming from the supply chain. what's happening on the consumer, you can see it in the scan nielsen, and the non-scan nielsen is probably a bit worse than the scan nielsen in terms of slowdown in sellouts to the consumers of all types of fmcg categories. so, it is a broad-based consumer slowdown. within that, from a beverage point of view, you have juice drinks and juices which are more to the rural areas and blue-collar. they are down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of view. something like coke is down low single digits and premium waters is growing. so, there's a shift in the category mix going on, which also actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tend to be higher than sparkling or water. that does not flow through to profitability. so, there is a rebasing going on in there. but, as i said, about half of it is the supply chain, the whiplash effect of the destocking by the customers. and that, as you say, is likely to be a much shorter-term impact. but, again, we're working on it but we're not including any improvement on that in our outlook, although clearly we want to get focused on it and get it to work. i agree with you, the consumer thing will take a little more time to come back, which is why we are focused on the game plan we know that works in downturns where we focus on affordability, on premiumizing for those parts of the country, like the premium metro areas, and bringing out new products to them, and that way we believe we can gain value share, which we continue to do in china so that we are set up as the consumer starts recovering. so, about half and half, and we believe that the consumer will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short term in the rest of this year. now, with regards to the refranchising, obviously can not really comment on the m&a, but i would say that we and our partners all believe in the long-term potential of the china market. we are very excited. and, as i said, because a large part of what's happening in the short term is destocking and inventory, everyone is looking past that and looking to the long term. and i think there is still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal done. and we'll obviously, from our point of view, make sure we do it on the right terms for ourselves, and they will be looking for the right terms for them, but we still think it is the right deal for everyone and with a good likelihood of getting done.
35;2;317;7;0.022082018927444796;dara, i'll just comment first and then maybe i ask kathy and james if they want to add anything. but certainly you've answered part of it by saying that, yes, revenue challenges are coming from those areas that have much lower margins, number one, for sure. and then, secondly, productivity efforts are continuing that is driving the margin expansion in quarter two. kathy mentioned the significant margin expansions that we achieved and i think productivity efforts are going to continue. and then, finally, i think there's also a mix. some of our better markets are doing well, like the united states and mexico, and also in the far east and japan. so there's a mix issue. and then, finally, the commodities continue to be pretty benign in terms of the outlook. so, those are the things that play into altogether, but primarily also the one that you mentioned which is the revenue, challenges are coming from much lower margin areas in terms of our business there. kathy, anything to add? no, i would say those are the reasons, which i would say probably you're picking up the fact that we do have more difficult comps in the back half for some of the things that muhtar mentioned. but we are confident that we will still be on our guidance. yes, we are overall very confident. the changes in marketing, the strategy on innovation pipeline, the one-brand strategy which is just at the beginning, the promotions that we have in store in the summer around the olympics, the price/mix expansion that we've experienced in quarter two, all of that we feel play into the equation, and give us confidence in the back half that there are slightly more challenging comps in the back, that we can actually cycle them and achieve them going forward, and feel confident that we can.
35;3;149;0;0.0;okay, ali. basically, it's in the rounding. so, yes, we gave comparable currency-neutral guidance on eps of 4% to 6%, and that was comparable currency neutral. so, then when you either take out another rounded point of structural -- so it rounds it down but it's really a rounding point of structural -- and if you take out currency, that gets you basically in that, the actual numbers, if you take out only 1 point of structural, gets you to 3% to 6%. but then it's in the rounding, so that's how we came up with the 4% to 7%. if you start with the 4% to 6%, you back out the currency and you back at a rounded point of structural, that gets you down to your 3% to 6%, and then it's really in the rounding you get to the 4% to 7%.
35;4;4;0;0.0;no, that's correct.
35;5;685;12;0.017518248175182483;sure. i think perhaps that's two questions in the second question there, ali. but let me have a go. in terms of re-assessing the actions, that's both on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. there are parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's at one end of the spectrum like us and japan where we've got good momentum. the us grew organically 4% in the quarter. japan is growing well. we are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the effectiveness of the market being the innovation or the execution. so, we are reallocating money to the places that have momentum. and that's on the developed end like the us and japan, it's also on the emerging end like indonesia and the philippines and places like that. so, we are going where we see the opportunities to get the biggest bang for the buck. now, we're taking some of the money from those markets that are under the most pressure and in those places we are prioritizing. yes, there's still some advertising, but we are doing innovations and we are doing execution, and, very importantly, doing affordability. the most extreme example, perhaps, is venezuela where there was no sugar and we've actually doubled down and really driving coke with zero sugar in venezuela with a full read one-brand look. there are places where we are adjusting to the need. just because you advertise does not mean people are going to buy if it's an affordability problem. i think china is a good example of where affordability is in there, as well. and i think i've talked a bit about china. but the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under pressure, we're really rolling out. so, that reassessing is moving some top-line money to those with momentum, and doubling down on execution and affordability and innovation in those pressured markets. that goes a bit to the advertising. advertising is up this quarter as we continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing mix in combination with innovation and execution. it's only when you get all of those together that you really get the best returns. so, we always look to make sure that all three are there, otherwise we'll end up wasting our money. we are out there and we're pushing ahead with it. and i think what we always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. so, for example, the one-brand strategy that we launched, announced, in the first quarter we started the rollout, the latest iteration of the graphics went into mexico a couple of months ago. that sort of marketing innovation takes time to build up an effect. so, we will keep pressing away with the investments and keep assessing. it's too early to call the success. we'd do that towards the end of the year. but we are focused on making that work. just to add to the point of roic on the marketing, when you take into account the price/mix expansion going from 1% to 3% in the quarter, when you take into account the core business that we have, which is really the company that's emerging out of this very rapid transformation and refranchising, is growing still at a point ahead of the total company currently, consolidated number, which is at 4, which is within our long-term growth targets that we've espoused to and talked about. i think that's also not maybe a micro metric but certainly an important metric to consider in terms of the payback on also all the activity. we're still in the early days of the one-brand strategy just launched in mexico a few months ago, just launched in europe and parts of europe. again, we feel confident that is going to continue to work in our benefit, coupled with the marketing that james talked about.
35;6;371;4;0.01078167115902965;sure, let me start. i do not think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. i think the trends on unit cases -- and let me just put out another way of looking at it -- have started at the beginning of the year. i think it is probably one of the few times we've seen the developed and our developing countries grow volume, and actually seen the emerging markets decline in aggregate. i know we only put out the numbers by groups but if you look at developed economies and developing economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countries. in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got volume growth and price/mix growth in developed and developing countries, which is very positive in terms of the long-term trajectory of the business. north america has got multi years of making that work in the revenue line. so, that's very strong. the volume weakness is all in the emerging markets and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. it's big in some of those markets but it's very concentrated. and the people then on the country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. so, hopefully that gives you a little insight on where the volume weakness is, but i do not think it has anything to do with the reorganization. in fact, i think the reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the downhill this year and into the future. and then on the price/mix, 3% is a good result. i think we've always talked about, our long-term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth, and we see a balanced split between volume and price/mix into the future. so, that gives you a 2% to 3% for price/mix component of the long-term growth. so, 3% is a strong result. long may it live. but the long-term growth model, we are looking for 4% to 6% in a balanced way.
35;7;314;13;0.041401273885350316;sure. on europe, i think europe got a little bit better this quarter. there are things weighing on our business. i'm not a big fan of calling out weather as a driver of performance. the weather occurs for good or for bad all around the world. now, in the case of spain and also france, that end of the mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. so, that's really what's driving, what's going on in the spanish business, and also it impacted the french business. we see europe getting a little bit better. we had some good results out of germany, and, as you said, some sequential improvement out of gb cycling out of some of the supply chain problems as they got fixed that came out of the first quarter. so, we see that starting to improve going forward. but i think -- i hate calling out the weather but i think that's really the reason in spain and france, and i think we'll start to see those businesses get better. now, it is worth saying that we've got a lot of good programs in europe, but the recent tragic events in belgium, in france and recently in germany, do weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. they go out less. we have strong on-premise businesses -- in fact, particularly in spain -- and that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events by perhaps staying at home a little more. that hopefully will get better in time as the security situation improves. but i do not want to get into weather and global events. i think the business in europe can get better. we've got a lot of launches coming up and we've got some strong programs. so, i think europe can continue to perform.
35;8;280;10;0.03571428571428571;i'm not going to comment on the beginning of july from a volume perspective. i would note that i think july was the biggest ever month for spain last year, so they've got some tough comps to cycle. they had a record summer last year. the underlying business in spain is improving. firstly, the economy's getting better. secondly, the supermarket environment in terms of rational pricing and some of the activities is getting better. and the spanish bottler made a massive investment going into last year to reinvest in returnable glass, which is one of the preeminent places in the world where this is true in the on-premise account, and that's starting to show good results, notwithstanding the weather and the security impacts in the year to date. and now with the ccep deal closed, and management fully focused on leveraging the best of the marketing, the best of the innovation, and really doubling down on the execution, i think we'll start to see improvements in spain and the other ccep territories. and on currency, yes, we did not change our guidance this quarter. we've had a lot of movement in some key currencies but basically they are offsetting each other. given the volatility that we've seen across the portfolio, some currencies are getting better, like brazil SEMICOLON some are staying the same or getting worse like in mexico. our hard currencies, we are hedged 100% basically. and then we hedge our emerging market currencies on a short-term basis opportunistically. with 2017 being fully hedged for our hard currencies, obviously our exposure then would be basically in our emerging market currencies.
35;9;4;0;0.0;2017, that's correct.
35;10;501;6;0.011976047904191617;judy, . again, it's muhtar. first, i think james talked in detail about where the volume shortfalls were coming from, and specifically related to certain large emerging markets that drove that number. that's related to brazil, that's related to china, being the large ones, but also russia. all of those emerging markets that used to have better disposable incomes, better macro conditions, basically drove some of that. and going forward certainly we expect some improvement in that area. that's number one. number two, i think important to note that, again, mentioned the developed markets grew and developing markets grew volume, and were ahead of the total company number, which was flat, and ahead of emerging markets. that itself will tell you that certainly the price/mix coming from those markets and then the total geographic mix that coupled with that is something that was instrumental in driving our price/mix number in the way it landed in the quarter. so, all of those factors and all the algebra coming together is what made that -- the country mix coming out of that, the geographic mix, and then the volume coupled with the pricing that we got. today, when you look at our us business, with 4% organic revenue growth in north america, that tells you that is in the upper certainly and very much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country. we're doing very well. japan performed well. again, mexico performed very well in terms of the volume and pricing combined driving the total number, of price/mix. so all of that really goes to explain and hopefully that answers your question on that. anything to add james, there? okay. on the price/mix question, judy, we did have this quarter price/mix was positive across in all other groups -- yes, primarily driven by latin america and inflationary pricing but also operational pricing in eag. but then it was offset by segment mix coming from the bottling investment segment. so, as james said, pricing of 2% to 3% is what we expect and what we would think would be very good pricing and in line with our segmentation strategy. even though eag was probably out of its normal range at this point, north america pricing is still very strong. we do believe in the segment strategy, and the 2% to 3% is what we expect going forward. and then the sparkling segment, just to finalize that, continues to be a segment of the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink where consumers continue to spend a very large amount of money in terms of consumer spend and in terms of the dollar value. it's still very healthy and that's why it gives us confidence looking into the future about what we are doing in terms of the segmented revenue growth strategy and in terms of the marketing approach and the one-brand strategy in taking the lion's share of that spend going forward.
35;11;372;4;0.010752688172043012;i think, in your first question, our medium-term outlook for the industry has not really changed. we're still expecting robust growth in the industry in the long term, driven by disposable income, urbanization, the middle class, innovation. we see these things expanding now. we've talked about that being in the 5% ballpark and then probably in the next few years talked about it being in the 4%. so, we do see it coming back over time, but we do see industry growth slightly moderated in the short term, as we talked a little bit about in some of the previous conferences. now, you did ask the question, we seemed short-term. give me a second to just read on the line. from our point of view, the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year to date is this asymmetry between where we own bottlers and where it's less than 20% of the volume, or about 20% of the volume, versus being in 200 countries. if you pass the bottling side and just look at the core concentrater franchise, we are running organic at 4% and we are meeting our profit guidance. we are not trying to say small ups and downs in the macro economies is what should buffet us every quarter. we just need to deal with those things. i just think there's this one asymmetrical effect at the bottling thing, which is important, which is affecting the number. but i do not want to give the impression we're seeing a massive, or trying to signal a deterioration in outlook for the concentrater franchise business. now, with regard to coke femsa, yes, we've talked about looking at some territories on a preferred basis. i'm not going to get into exactly how that means in terms of what preferred means versus exclusive, but they are our biggest bottling partner. we have a very strong relationship. we have made an agreement on how we're going to create more value together in mexico and how they can look to participate in some of the refranchising of the territories that we own in bottling. and we're very excited about doing more stuff together.
35;12;209;2;0.009569377990430622;yes, in part, please read into this that we are moving the business to more of a revenue focus. absolutely, under the heading -- everything communicates -- that is part of what we're trying to say. we believe in our segmented revenue approach. it's not that we have forgotten about volume or do not believe it's an underlying driver in the long term, particularly in the emerging markets, of what's going to create the business over the long term. but as we look at places like north america and some of the other developed markets, clearly we're going after more of a revenue strategy that's driven by smaller packages, by some pricing actions. we do want to call out that perhaps the best way to think about health of the business going into the future is the revenue growth. and that's where i think what we're trying to say is, not just the beverage industry, the sparkling industry category and brand coke all remain healthy in terms of revenue growth. all three of those are growing revenue globally, and we continue to see good attraction both in the us in terms of sparkling revenue growth and internationally in terms of sparkling revenue growth.
36;1;336;10;0.02976190476190476;nik, , this is muhtar. thanks for your questions. look, i think first, once again, i want to reiterate the scale of what is being done here on a global basis. as i mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the regions impacted by this refranchising, massive refranchising, is really, when you aggregate it all, is roughly around 50% of our -- it will impact 50% of our global volume. so this is really, really big, number one. number two, the early indications that we have from both the us refranchising efforts, which is the largest one, but also the european restructuring under the coca-cola european partners umbrella, which was the biggest refranchising in europe in history, in its structure, essentially, has been -- early indications have been positive. in the united states, if you look at it, the last six quarters, consecutively, we have had volume growth and very encouraging price/mix in the united states continued. and the last sort of year, four quarters, have been the highest in terms of refranchising activity. so early indications are positive. europe, the same. and james mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the last quarter. yes, helped by many other things other than just refranchising, but the impact is that there has not been the disruption, it has been going on very smoothly. and you know, when you look at this going forward, we've got four to five quarters of intense refranchising remaining, as we bring out at the other end of the tunnel a company that is going to be totally transformed, revitalized in terms of its organizational capabilities, leadership structure, revitalization of the brands, also with the investment in our brands as a new marketing, revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system, as well as our cost base. so we are encouraged with what we see, as the transformed coca-cola company coming out, and also the integrity of the refranchising, as evidenced by the continued good results in north america and in europe.
36;2;1;0;0.0; , dara.
36;3;445;6;0.01348314606741573;dara, this is muhtar here, i will just mention very briefly, and then pass it over to james, that it is unusual, what you have just said is definitely is the fact that developed markets are growing at a higher pace than the developing and emerging markets, but it is not a surprise, given the volatility that we all know that is taking place. but it is a mixed bag. it is not just a uniform, all emerging markets. africa, for example, continues to be a very strong performer, both west africa, led by nigeria, but also other markets in africa. so it is -- mexico, to name another one -- so it is a mixed bag, but let me ask james to comment in more detail on how we see the future also in terms of the balance between emerging and developing versus developed markets. yes. i think it is worth, as we go into this, just underlining, the collection of the developed markets are growing volume, growing price, strong revenue growth. we think we are taking actions to sustain that. the emerging markets, i think it is going to be a combination here of doing the things that we need -- we know we need to do and can control, and then of course there is the question of what do the macro economics do, and what actions do each country's governments take to put them on a better course or not. so that is part of the unknown going forward at this stage and the uncertainty. i think quite clearly, you see, as muhtar commented, a mixed bag, across the world you see those markets that are doing well, sustained growth, and he called out nigeria, south africa, the philippines, and other parts of the emerging market. so it is good. but it is a mixed bag. and i think the actions are under way in a number of these countries to stabilize them, where they are a little tougher like brazil, like argentina, which are called out on the call earlier. and we will have to see how long it takes for this to take hold in the countries from a macro view. we do not have a clear sight on that. but what we do know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries and go back to affordability, go back to execution, go back to the basics and build ourselves a better position with more market share so when it does turn, and that combines with the growth in developed markets, we can be solidly in our growth rates for our long-term model. thank you.
36;4;189;1;0.005291005291005291;hi, bill. so on your first question about the 3%, yes, we did not find another way to make one and one equal three, it is rounding and it is really balanced. so it was in the rounding, but it was a balanced impact on volume as well as a balanced impact from pricing. on your second question, bill, james here, i think what is worth remembering is essentially we are not trying to pass through the devaluation. we focus on being competitive in each local market beverage and fast moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the economies are in tough times, focusing on staying competitive and gaining share for the long term. the net of all of that means we are much more likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt a strategy of a full pass-through of the devaluation of the dollar, so obviously if the exchange rates change, that will mean different dollar numbers for the corporation. but the local strategy remains, stay competitive in the marketplace, and it looks more like local inflation. does that answer your question?
36;5;354;2;0.005649717514124294;sure. i mean let me start by saying you're approximately right, in volume terms, on the current split between sparkling and stills, about 70/30. i think it is worth noting that that split has been moving in the favor of stills by about a point a year. the turn of the century, 10, 15 years ago, it was a single digit percent of the mix. it is going up at about a percent a year. now, part of that is organic on the things we are doing, and part of that is the net or some of the bolt on acquisitions but it is going up about a percent a year of mix. i think as you look forward, clearly, we, given that we have 50% of the sparkling industry value share, and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories, because it will be the culmination of the category growth rate, plus our ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how are the investments aligned? i feel they are aligned. obviously it is an ongoing process. each year, we look at it in the business planning process and we will be doing that again this year, but i would not characterize it as we are over-invested in sparkling and under-invested in stills. we are invested behind what is growing. and actually just add a little more texture to it we are doing the right things on sparkling, and we tend to be pushing more money towards driving the zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. in the stills, it is not a one size fits all category. in fact, we model categories and there we are selective on which ones have a most on trend with the consumers and which ones have more premium pricing. and therefore, we are very selective on where we funnel the dollars and invest ahead of the curve or in line with the growth rates that we are expecting.
36;6;88;1;0.011363636363636364;yes, andrew, this is, , this is muhtar, i think you would expect us to be looking for proven capability, alignment, and bottlers that have already got a track record in our system, and that we have actually delivered together in alignment, where -- and we have good examples of that, that we can refer to. but that is basically, it in a nutshell, and i think, i know you probably have a loaded question, but you know, in answering to your actual question, that is what i would say.

36;8;111;2;0.018018018018018018;we certainly did well in a number of the categories, particularly some of the premium categories. what was a little weaker in this quarter was some of the juice businesses and some of the tea businesses, which are not as high value to us. so that is what netted out on the 2%. what you think -- what i think you see is over the year, you see very strong growth in vitamin water, in sports drinks, and some of the other categories, as well, so i think it is a broadening of the portfolio, a focus on innovation, but yet there's some head winds on juice, linked somewhat to commodities.
36;9;766;17;0.022193211488250653;sure, , ali, james here. look, north america, i think is a combination of many, many things. i mean it has i think been the result of a number of years working on multiple fronts. working on innovation across the portfolio, getting into categories, refining the propositions, learning, refining the propositions. it is about, in the sparkling business, the better marketing, the more media spend. it is about the focus on the pricing and packaging architecture, with more smaller packages, and it is about getting the execution right. it is the refranchising, bringing new excited bottlers in. in the end this is a result that has been built by a great team of people, who have been very focused over a number of years about regenerating growth in the north american business. as muhtar said, they have had six very solid quarters of volume and revenue growth. and i think there are a lot of learnings. there is no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings. having said that, japan has also been on a good run, the past three quarters are very good volume growth, you know, doing well on offsetting deflationary pressure. again a similar story. the team is very focused on a multiple category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the quality and quantity of the marketing. but always in parallel and in alignment with the bottler where you got to get better execution. good marketing on its own is not going to get you the answers. there's got to be more and better marketing along with more and better execution. i think that's you see. and to some extent, western europe, that kind of came, new coca-cola european partners came well out of the stables on the first quarter. i think the formula is going to be the same. more and better marketing. more and better execution. and a multilane focus on categories and cranking out the learning, the [trying stuff], the innovation, and pushing ahead. and i think that is something we are going to continue to press across the developed markets. now, turning to china, i think china, again, i do not think, if i gave the impression it was all weather, that would be unfair to the team on the ground in china, and the system there. they have done a lot of work to address the big change in how the consumer responded to the economic circumstances in china. i think part of it is, you know, it is a part of the world that has had such consistent growth rates over the last decade, but a little bit of a slowdown maybe towards some exaggerated pull-back on spending, so i think there is a little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. we saw that. we have definitely taken action in the things that we can control. not just in the commercial policies, to strengthen the wholesaler and distributor network and working through the inventory problem, but also on the pricing and packaging. to give you one example, a very small example, but it is symptomatic of how fast china can change. if you go to the cafe channel in china, all of the noodle shops up and down the street, people go there at lunchtime. last year they were packed with people. this year, you go, they are a third empty. you go okay, maybe the economy slowed down. no, that's not what is happening. the explosion of online to offline ordering and the availability of lots of people on bikes and motorbikes to deliver stuff and the apps the aggregate wraps to buy food, it has been an explosion of ordering online and delivery food. such that there's just as many people buying from these cafes, but sometimes in some parts of china, a third of it is being delivered to people, whether it is work or to students, so we have to adapt that packaging. having a returnable glass bottle in that cafe does not help you with offline delivery. so we have had to revamp the packaging offer so we are there with the right package to go where the consumer is going. that is a micro example of the sorts of thing we have had to do in china to adapt to how the market is changing and is contributing to the stabilization. but it is as i said, a country undergoing change in its economic model and that will throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we will have to adapt.
36;10;0;0;NA; .
36;11;268;6;0.022388059701492536;hi, bryan, it is james. look, we have had a much better run in the philippines in the last few quarters, actually, strong numbers the first three quarters. this year actually, last year, was three very strong quarters as well SEMICOLON so i think since femsa has been in, there they have built on the work that [big] did, they have gone about fixing the fundamentals. there were some fundamental structural stuff that still needed to be improved and i think they grasped that in the early days an we are starting to see the benefits of that coming through in the last six quarters. again, it is not silver bullet stuff. it is not too complicated in the sense of, you know, it has been about adapting the price package architecture, it is about some of the emphasis on of some of the sparkling brands in the philippines, some of the local brands that we de-emphasized and re-emphasized some of the more global brands and the stronger local brands, rebuilding and continuing to construct a more solid distributor network. obviously philippines is complicated given all of the islands and the issue of moving product around. i think they have kind of worked the system in terms of getting the thing nicely oiled in terms of the cogs so the product could get everywhere, backed up with a little more marking and a little sharper focus on certain categories and i think that's played through. i think the team on the ground has done a good job of taking the performance to a higher level.
36;12;0;0;NA; .
36;13;236;6;0.025423728813559324;hi, brett, this is muhtar. first, let me just say that over the last four or five years, we have been actually working really, really hard to reconfigure the japanese bottling system. we had 13 bottlers what, back five years or six years ago, and now we are working towards having 85% of the total business in japan, which as you know is a very large business for us, under one roof. and i think that [itself] first, and without looking outside, without looking anywhere, it is a huge re-architecture that is yielding substantial savings, and we can redeploy that into being, into route to market, into ways we actually get our products the most effective efficient way to the customer, and through the customer to the consumer in japan. regardless of any encouragement from the outside, we are on track to end up in a very efficient, very 21st century bottling system and consumer goods delivery system in japan that is working well now, are there other communities, as that is just not related to cost savings? and yes, there has been early, very early discussions in japan. i can not say any more than that and we will continue to look at opportunities to see if we can even make our japanese system even stronger. but that is very early days, again, in terms of the level of discussions that have taken place.
36;14;1;0;0.0; , bill.
36;15;291;4;0.013745704467353952;sure, let me say a couple of thoughts, and then kathy will give you some comments on the margin. look, the stills, if i can say one thing, which is the stills is not a category. it is a combination of many different categories and even those categories re-segment between premium, mainstream, and more affordable. and so what we are focused on doing, as we invest in the stills business, is yes growing in aggregate, in top line numbers, but we are being selective on focusing on those places where we think we can generate a better return in the long term. it is not a growth of bulk water. it is a focus on where is the consumer demand, what is on trend, and if you just pick out a couple of things that are on trend, things like coconut waters, or premium juices or premium ready to drink coffees, these are all very high revenue products. kathy, do you want to talk about the margins? sure. hi, bill. you are going to see some impact on margins, but mostly initially, because as we are going into these businesses, whether we are developing them internally or whether they are through bolt-on acquisitions, they do have a margin impact. but then as we get scale, as we continue to work on the supply chain, et cetera, we do start to improve the margins. so i would say the initial issue for margins and then over time, we are able to do things that will improve the margin impact. but initially, yes, as a category itself, a lot of these stills have higher cost of goods -- they have higher revenue but higher cost of goods, so that does impact margins.
36;16;522;4;0.007662835249042145;sure. james here. look, i think it is important to say that the premium opportunity in china is big, but it is not as big as the mainstream opportunity. we are absolutely focused on investing in that premium opportunity. it is very much about the big cities, the white collar. it is going to be also about some of the premium parts of the still categories. we are going to go after that. but in the end, the biggest mass of consumers, the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. so it will have to be a combination, of yes, addressing the premiums, but also going after the mainstream with the greater affordability, expanding the distribution reach, upgrading the execution into the third tier cities and in the rural areas, that is also going to be a big driver of our revenue. in terms of the categories, i think what has been going really well, by example, is we have taken an approach of premiumizing our water business in china. one of our most recent billion dollar brands, ice dew, comes out of china. effectively, we are driving the business from -- in the end -- a one rmb price point to a two rmb price point. that is one of the biggest drivers of growth, is the water at the two rmb. the places where we have taken -- had a little tougher time is perhaps in the juice category, with sparkling in the middle. again, when you look at what is growing in terms of the categories, what you do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who is suffering and who is not suffering in terms of disposable income. the juices, the kind of ambient, more going to the rural areas, have been hit a little harder. the premium waters which are perhaps more in the cities have been doing well. and on the second question about the structural impact, so we will obviously give more information on 2017 later, as we get closer to the beginning of the year. but i will say that in the -- particularly in the north america refranchising, the impact will be significant in 2017, because as we are moving to get all of the refranchising completed in 2017, that is, we will be moving more than we have moved in all of 2015 and 2016 combined. so it will be a large impact in 2017, and we will work to give you all more color on that later in the year, or early 2017. and as far as 2018 is concerned, the refranchising will be done, but it will be -- the impact will be basically the cycling of it, obviously the timing of these transitions will be significant, not only to 2017 but also the impact it will have on 2018. and then we have some costs that we have to get out in 2018 that we will be working to get out in early 2018, that will be basically a function of the refranchising as well. so we will give you more color as time passes.
37;1;2;0;0.0;thank you.
37;2;388;6;0.015463917525773196;sure. , brian. a couple of thoughts there. over the long term we said we are looking for a balance between price and volume, or price mix and volume, and that's certainly our long-term objective. now, given what's happening i think it's almost as you said, it's easier to divide the world into the developed and the emerging markets. in the developed countries, we are looking to drive, probably a little more price than volume and you can see that happening in the us marketplace as we focus on smaller packages, as we focus on higher value categories or subcategories. so, you see that across north america, western europe is a little more balanced and similarly into japan. so, that's our approach for developed markets. in the emerging markets, obviously over the long term, we expect them to be a bigger source of underlying volume growth and that will bring the total company equation into balance. so they would be more volume driven and less price driven. now what's happening is in some of the markets, say for example, a brazil, where the macros are really under pressure, i mean gdp over the last three years in brazil has probably declined by more than it did in the great recession or the lost decade of the 80s. so there what we focus on is in any moment we will do those promotional things that make sense and return. so we do not over protect volume. we do what makes sense on a quarterly or monthly basis and the principal access we act on is trying to reform the packaging strategy to make it more affordable. whether that be smaller one-way packaging or more returnable packages backed up by good marketing, that really empathizes with the economic situation the consumers are in, and obviously great execution by the bottling system. so net-net, likely over time developed markets will get more price mix and slightly less volume and in the emerging markets more volume and slightly less price mix, with that caveat that those markets that struggle, we have a game plan that we've developed over the years and that we find helps us really build a good, strong consumer franchise going forward and balances the short-term. next question please.
37;3;2;0;0.0;thank you
37;4;308;4;0.012987012987012988;sure. well, i think you saw lots of flow-through actually in the fourth quarter. operating income, currency neutral ex-structure, was up 18% off of gross profit of 8% so there was 10 points of leverage, so we got a lot of leverage coming through. the reason i did not translate from operating income to pbt, is more of those other factors like interest or other corporate items. the underlying operation, actually when i talk about pbt growing at 8% in 2016 and what we've guided in 2017, actually, the underlying operating income performance is actually even better than that. and then we've got a bit of a headwind in interest in some of those other items. so there's actually a lot of leverage coming through from the operation as we focus on segmented revenue, as we focus on higher value categories, as we focus on smaller packages, we are getting a lot of operating leverage between that revenue line and the operating income line. some of its getting netted off in the headwind. so, it is there. in the fourth quarter, just to make the point, 6% is not projectable going forward. you will see in the numbers, for example, we were cycling a big negative in asia from pacific from last year so we've got a big positive this year. we had some very good results in improvements where we own bottling operations like china which was very -- much weaker in the first half. so there's some oddities in the fourth quarter. i would encourage everyone to look at maybe the full-year 2016, look through to the core operation where we were drawing at 4%, 8% pbt, bear in mind some interest headwinds as a higher operating income growth, lots of leverage. this is the game plan for 2017.
37;5;0;0;NA; 
37;6;281;2;0.0071174377224199285;sure. of course i'll save some things for cagny. let me start with the sparkling business is growing revenue. it grew revenue in 2015, it grew revenue in 2016, momentum's rebuilding. if you look at the us sparkling was up 1% in the fourth quarter in the us, in aggregate, in volume and obviously much more in revenue so there is the sparkling category is growing revenue. another piece under that just take a couple of examples, in this quarter and last quarter as well, total if you take the combination of diet coke, coke light, and coke zero, they came into robust growth in the back of the year. the growth of those all together, so no calorie colas exceeds the growth of -- sparkling actually exceeds the growth of our total portfolio in most of our other categories. so, there's robust growth that we press into zero sugar colas. we're getting the growth and in north america and some of the other places where we are pushing smaller packages we're getting the good growth. smaller packages in the us grew almost 10% in the fourth quarter. so, the game plan out there of smaller packages, zero sugar, re-engagement with the sparkling category, is driving the revenue growth and we believe it will continue to do so and the shape and the quality of that, in terms of sustainability, is looking better over time. obviously tuck-on m&a will not sparkling related, we've consistently done a few things each year, hopefully we'll do a few in 2017e will do those that make strategic sense, financial sense, and where we find willing partners.
37;7;475;0;0.0;i'll start maybe and then, kathy, if you feel like jumping in at any point let me know. okay the 2017 3%, i think we see a similar year in 2017 in terms of macros that we did in 2016. and i think we are making a prudent call given everything that's going on in the world on a consolidated basis we are expecting a similar outlook and a similar number for the total company. obviously as kathy said, we'd like to see the core business grow above that as we did in 2016 where the consolidated was 3% in the core was 4% which is at the bottom end of our range and then obviously lots of operating leverage. so, that's how we are seeing it, we just see the way the world is going. in terms of 2018 obviously we are not providing guidance on 2018, we are just providing some of the elements that we know are important from a modeling perspective. so obviously 2018 conversation will have to wait. but we wanted people to understand the structural piece because obviously the timing of when we sell those transactions makes a big difference. and so as timing varies the structural adjustment can move backwards and forwards between 2018, so we just wanted to give people a total perspective. i do not know kathy about number three. i'm not sure we have the thing in front of us, ali. the bridge of total structural versus what we shown at cagny. part of what i think is a misunderstanding [stood in] structural adjustments, is particularly in this year we talk about the 5% to 6%. the two additional things you can factor in in your structural adjustments -- the ccr business is not standing still, it's continuing to grow, as well as the fact that they are taking out stranded costs. now, we think of stranded costs a lot like productivity, if you will, and so we have embedded those and that's why i said in my prepared remarks we have two points of productivity -- of two points of stranded costs that are coming out as well in our numbers. but the stranded costs are more like productivity and that they do not just transfer with the territories. there's work to do to get them out, and for some reason if they do not transfer, they are part of our business, and we have to do the work to get them out long-term. so, the stranded costs, we treat that as part of the business and you can choose to net those or not to better understand the structural impact. but that's how they represent themselves in our numbers. and again we are not giving any other underlying growth guidance for 2018 at this point.
37;8;0;0;NA; .
37;9;269;9;0.03345724907063197; , bill. james here. firstly, the aggregate amount of marketing spend is slightly below [gross profit] you are correct. now, what is super important to know, within that, is we will continue to increase what we would call working spend of the marketing ahead of revenue, but we are driving material productivity in the way we organize and produce the marketing to become much more efficient. so, we are able to grow media, if you like, in all its different forms ahead of revenue, but with the extra productivity initiatives we are actually growing total spend less than revenue. that's how that dynamic is working. so we will be able to do much more in the marketplace in a more efficient way. and then secondly, on coke zero sugar, absolutely, you should expect us to move around the world things that are successful and that had a great start in gb in the backend of 2016, was growing double digits, very good start. we are rolling out in europe, it's just launched in australia, so you can absolutely expect us to push it into those markets where we think it can be really effective, including latin america soon. so, absolutely and i think that is part of why you are now seeing the continued acceleration of coke zero sugar each year. we grew several points faster in volume in 2015 than 2014 and we grew several points faster in 2016 than the rate we were growing in 2015. and as i said aggregate, no calorie colas, is in good mid-single digits growth as we exited the year.
37;10;2;0;0.0;thank you.
37;11;370;7;0.01891891891891892;sure. clearly there's a -- i'm not -- disconnect. the nielsen universe is a much smaller piece of our total business. obviously when you look at the aggregate of north america, fountain is very important to us, it's almost a third of the volume in north america and that's not going through nielsen and obviously there's a lot of warehouse business there, where we sell some of the still categories directly. but we have not deviated from our strategy. we talked on previous quarters that sometimes the pricing will be, at least -- the apparent pricing and nielsen look a little softer or a little better. the important message is we have not changed our strategy. we continue to focus on realizing pricing intelligently and through packaging and pricing in the sparkling category and focusing on those bits of the other categories that we believe have value in terms of revenue and profitability. and so every now and again you will see this disconnect between nielsen and our total results, but know that our strategy has not changed and we plan to continue to pursue it into 2017. in terms of the other categories, absolutely we continue to innovate and invest there. i think the underlying trend is even better than it what it jumps out in the volume. bearing in mind the strategy is to participate in those categories of the highest value to us, both in revenue and in terms of profitability. so for example if you went to china and you looked at what was happening, some of the stills categories, maybe water, you'd see a growth rate of x, but what you do not see in the volume is actually, we are selling less of the cheap water and more of the higher value water as we cycle and re-innovate our business to drive the positioning and the premiumness through different brands and reset the way we attack some of these categories. we are after driving a consumer franchise that's about incidence of consumers, the number of times they drink our beverages, even if that's a smaller package, and about competing for value on the top and the bottom line.
37;12;211;7;0.03317535545023697;yes, nik, . absolutely north america's had a great run. the team's done a good job, the strategy's working. the numbers in 2015 in 2016 have put us at the top end of cpgs in terms of revenue growth with our customers. we are very pleased with that. i think what you see in the north american strategy, which is absolutely what you should expect, is a fusion. and what i mean by that is things that they have done they have taken from other parts of the world successfully and they have blended it with new ideas and things that are relevant for the north american market. and that's what turned into the winning plan they put in place and they've executed and it's been doing well. and so you should expect us always to be taking ideas from one place, applying the learnings in another place, and fundamentally, north america is a great example of where we reinvest marketing behind the right strategy and a balanced portfolio, with execution by the bottling system. and i underline there the importance of the execution by the bottling system and our own fountain and what wholesale business is during a time of tremendous change through the refranchising.
37;13;167;1;0.005988023952095809;sure, i do not think it would be appropriate to comment on the m&a process of bai so i'm going to skip that one, if i may. refranchising in africa, i think there's been a very robust process and i think the management team of the bottler, both prior to the closing of the sab transaction under abi on the board as well and ongoing, the management team has remained focused on doing the right things in the marketplace. so a creditable performance by the management team in conjunction with the local business unit. so we see no disruption there and i think everything is going well. the refranchising itself, as muhtar commented, and as you've seen, we reached agreement with abi at the close of last year and the rest of the process is ongoing, both from a regulatory process point of view and a selection and determination of the partner, from those that will be strongest and those that are interested.
37;14;2;0;0.0;thank you.
37;15;509;8;0.015717092337917484;sure, i think the emerging markets is a very mixed bag. i mean there are some which are doing well, i called out some like nigeria, which had a very strong year even in the close of the year, as the currency came under pressure. places like mexico -- there are a number of emerging markets, south africa, which we did well in. there are others where the macros were tough, whether that be venezuela, very tough, argentina, brazil, and there we applied our strategies, a combination of what's the right tactical use of promotions to balance the system. we do not want to [do] scale but we do not want to over invest in promotions, while resetting the pack price architecture to really drive long-term affordability. it's very much a mixed bag across the world. obviously india is something that a lot of people commented on, i'm not sure any more i can add on the india example. in terms of china, i think china is a great example where you see us executing the game plan i talked about for brazil. so, the china back end of 2015 coming into the first and the second quarters of 2016, was a very rough period for cpg, a rough period for beverages in china. we went for our game plan, exactly what i said about brazil, we started to do some promotional things and then we reset some of the pack price architecture, we focused on the right package sizes, and the right brands, doing the marketing in the right way, and a reset of what was important in terms of execution, where you should execute in terms of channels and focus of the cities. so, in the case of china, the markets are actually doing pretty well in the top tier cities. there was lots of growth, it looked more like the strategy of focus on the value end, focus on the premium end of the business, and then in the more rural and lower tier cities, really affordability and smaller package sizes. and then in the second half of 2016 china rebounded. we grew in both the third of the fourth quarter in volume terms and in revenue terms in china. so the game plan worked, obviously it's not instantaneous, but we know what to do when markets get into trouble if we focus on understanding the consumer, understanding the customer, and getting organized as a system. yes, i'll just add one point just to complement what james said is that this was the 38th consecutive quarter for us in gaining value share -- 38th in nartd. and in sparkling this was the 12th consecutive quarter of share gains. and then in north america, importantly, 27th consecutive quarter of share gains. so we continue to gain share as we implement this play-book that's really working and the business is getting stronger over a much, much bigger base than any one of our competitors going forward. i just wanted to add that.
37;16;0;0;NA; .
37;17;582;13;0.022336769759450172;sure, mexico, in all honesty, i'm not sure the mexican consumers, in terms of what happened to the marketplace, the purchasing patents, really changed that much pre and post that date. i think the mexican economy, there's been a lot of focus on it. there were the reforms, i think it's performed well and we have a great business in mexico. i think our system there has been innovating. it's truly one of the places where we've been most innovative and most creative across the total portfolio where we compete in almost every category and they've done a really robust job of building a good business. and i think that is what you see in the mexico results and they continued to build on strong a 2015, with a stronger 2016. and i think it's a wonderful operation down there and they did a very creditable result and hopefully that will all continue into 2017. certainly we think that our system is up to the challenge come what may in mexico. in terms of brazil and india i think they are two very different examples. india, it's certainly a truly one-off event. the demonetization effectively drained liquidity. i do not think that's about price elasticity, i think that's about the shock to the circulation and liquidity. clearly we're of the view that a formalization of the economy helps the formal players and i think it will be good in the medium term and the long-term. we expect the short-term disruptions to [mitigate] or to tail off as we come into 2017, though not from january 1. and i think what we just need to see is some stabilization there, and we will be able to then come back and execute our game plan. so i do not think that's particularly about resetting everything we do in india, i think it's about working through the effects of this one-off demonetization. brazil is a different thing. brazil i talked about. i think we saw -- we've taken quite a bit of pricing in brazil over the end of 2015 in the beginning of 2016. i think the consumer environment got worse towards the end of the year in brazil. i know a number of the states in brazil had trouble with some of the public employee payrolls going into the back of the year. so there was a reduction in the mass of consumer disposable income, perhaps more aggravated q3 going into q4. and i think there, the elasticity's and the effects of pricing did become worse. the value of the promotions was not as good as perhaps the high-lows, it was not as good as it was at the beginning of the year or even in 2015. and i think that's what's caused us to do some things in the fourth quarter to balance pricing and volume, but to recognize we need to come in for 2017 with a more aggressive reset of the pack price architecture. given the circumstances in brazil they're not likely to be completely fixed overnight. i think there's some focus on improving things and we expect brazil to slowly get better but we are going to execute and implement a packed price. reset some parts of it with the expectation that it will start to rebuild the business as the economics get a bit better.
37;18;0;0;NA; .
37;19;97;0;0.0;certainly, hi, bill. so, this year the commodity environment was relatively benign and we anticipate that next year -- the same thing. as we said, next year will be largely the same as what we've seen in 2016. we do anticipate that with the refranchising that our exposure to commodities goes down significantly. as we talked about (technical difficulty) cagny. so there is a -- we will give you some more flavor of this in the modeling call but yes, there's a significant change in the impact to the coca-cola company as it relates to commodity.
38;1;533;10;0.01876172607879925;this is muhtar. and just let me say a few things on the global macros, and i'll pass it over to james also to reflect on your -- particularly your second question on -- and i assume the second question you had was mainly talking to u.s. bottlers, but you can clarify that. as far as -- the world growth based on recent -- latest numbers from imf or taken from any other organization is expected to rise in 2017 from -- versus 2016 by about 0.5 percent point, so, like, going from 3.1 to about 3.5, just under 0.5%, and further expected to slightly improve in '18. based on the latest numbers, always what we have seen in our business is that the industrial production index, ipi, kind of goes a little bit ahead of disposable income growth, and that's what we are experiencing once again here. so yes, some countries, growth looks better, china for sure. india, with the impact of the currency exchange initiative, still is moving out of that, as james mentioned. and as well as brazil and venezuela, i think we can term as being in deep recession. and then geopolitical factors in the middle east and part of north africa probably means the balance of risks remain still tilted to the downside, if you like. but there was a divergence in terms of the consumer confidence index since 2014, and that's narrowing down between the developing world and the developed world, which is a positive. that means the developing world is getting a little better from a confidence index point of view. and i think we're seeing that in parts of africa, like particularly big markets, in nigeria, and then, again, in -- our business in china also is reflecting the improved macros. and then we still see growth in japan, korea, in the industrial markets, which is a very positive sign. again, as we -- as the emerging and developing markets get better, we see there's still growth coming from the developed markets, as in western europe and japan and korea. so that's sort of what i would like to just say on the macros. and then, james, go ahead and... sure. thanks, muhtar. so nik, i think particularly as your question seemed more u.s. oriented, i mean, in the end this is an and answer. our objective is not to run from one side of the ship to the other. this is an and answer. we need the company and the bottlers individually and collectively to make both work. and i think the u.s. is an example, where we have a vibrantly growing revenue line for sparkling and a vibrantly growing revenue line for the other categories. we're -- there, we're engaging the consumers. we're improving our execution. so i think it's about growth. it's about expanding and responding to consumer and customer needs. and i think we have demonstrated over the last number of years that we can vibrantly grow both, and that is absolutely our strategy going forward. and that'll be good for us, and it will be good for the bottlers.
38;2;351;4;0.011396011396011397;thanks. thanks, dara. and i'll probably go with the m&a and then the portfolio question. i mean, obviously, we're not going to comment on our outlook on likely m&a. i think we've said 3 things related to m&a in the past. i would re-underline them. one, anything we do needs to fit strategically in where we're trying to go. secondly, it needs to be financially attractive, and that's not always the case. and third, there is some degree of opportunism because it takes 2 to tango. you need not just a willing acquiree SEMICOLON you need a willing seller. so i think whilst we have a view -- an ongoing view of what assets are out there, small, medium and large, that are attractive to us, of course, that is something that is not predictable in time. so whilst we imagine we will continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, everything else is not -- you can not predicate your strategy necessarily on that. so we focus on driving what we can organically. we have taken the rest of the portfolio outside of sparkling from a single-digit piece of our business at the turn of -- when -- 10, 15 years ago to over 1/4 of the business. of course, we would love to increase the runway -- run rate at which we broaden our portfolio, and we were certainly seeking to do so. but the law of big numbers is also true. it's not going to magically change overnight. we need to build winning propositions with the consumers, with the customers and build the physical infrastructure that economically makes that happen in a profitable way. so yes, more acceleration outside of sparkling whilst -- and i return to the answer to the previous question, it's an and, continuing to grow the revenue of the sparkling category. and therefore, we will consecutively broaden out where we get to. at some point, will it be more balanced? absolutely. will it be broader? absolutely. but we will look to do the right things at the right pace.
38;3;624;8;0.01282051282051282;sure. i'm not sure that i'd base the dynamic of one question at a time, but i'll give it a go and cover off some of those pieces. look, on the categories and balancing, of course, as we approach into new brands or new categories in new countries, there is an investment curve as you build the brand. but this needs to be managed through a portfolio. i mean, one -- the fact that a new brand is being launched in country x does not mean it's not already developed in country y, and therefore, it's already profitable and generating cash. so we need to manage the total portfolio effect, which is not just across categories but across the life-stage development of any one brand and category across the world because they're not equally developed everywhere. so there's a portfolio management thing. of course, our objective, whatever the category, is to build brands and positions that are inherently profitable once we get to the appropriate scale. so we're not trying to build things that will never arrive. we're trying to build brands in categories, whether it's inherent in the brand or inherent in the package side, that can be profitable for us and the bottling system. in terms of the leadership appointments and how the work will be impacted, i mean, we've done a lot of things. i mean, a lot of the impacts on the work is the nexus of we're about to enter the post-refranchising stage. so we're going to go from well over 110,000 employees to under 40,000 employees by some point next year. there's just physically less stuff that needs to get done at the corporate center to support that organization. secondly, technology keeps advancing, and what is possible to anticipate and get done using technology and change the way work can be done is a lot more today than it was a number of years ago. we need to embed that in, in the organization. and then the third thing is the ongoing efforts to define new ways of doing the same thing with less resources or getting more bang for the buck because we can be innovative in the way we run our processes. so that goes across each of the corporate functions, including the enabling transaction-based services and there's a plan in each place. now as it relates to francisco and that organization, i think one of the -- there's 2 points that i base our logic to. the first one is if our principal operating model is local and geographic, that is the franchise system. i mean, you got to choose one principal avenue to organize against. anything you organize against will have its blind spots, and then you can mitigate against that. so one of the roles of francisco's group is to provide the global perspective and the category perspective because it's the inverse -- it's a theme that the field -- the sum of the field might miss. so that's part of why the corporate center exists. the second reason to bring all the pieces together is as brands and experiences are created today and into the future, it's less cleanly delineated between a tv ad or a customer program or anything else. there's a much greater intersection and integration of how to engage with consumers and shoppers. and therefore, bringing together in one group the classical marketing pieces with a customer piece with a commercial piece and with the strategy, underpinned with the digital engagement, is what's going to allow us to more seamlessly operate in this new environment.
38;4;225;1;0.0044444444444444444;sure. so i think the changes are structural and strategic. we need to reset the price/pack architecture. we're going to use more returnables as an infrastructure and investment channel. so we're resetting. i mean, it's worth remembering that the contraction in the brazilian economy, it's contracted more in the last few years than it contracted in the last decade of the '80s and more than it contracted in the depression in the 1920s last year -- last century. so this is -- brazil has undergone a major economic contraction. so we're resetting what we're doing in brazil around pack/price architecture, how we go to market and how we push that forward. so it will take some time to get in place. and also, frankly, the stabilization in the brazilian economy will continue to take time. now the other thing impacting the latin american numbers, it's worth underlining it does not always hit [ across our ] radar screen is venezuela. and venezuela is substantially negative in the first quarter, and i think that really is macroeconomic. and it's not about resetting our business. it's about the country is in the state it's in. but the brazilian thing, just to summarize, the changes are strategic. they'll take some time. we expect that to play through this year.
38;5;443;2;0.004514672686230248;sure. so starting with the additional $800 million, i mean, the driver of the change, the principal driver is the reorganization of the corporate center, the 1,200 positions i talked about. that's the majority of the $800 million or a little over half the $800 million. then there are some parts in cost of goods and a little bit in marketing. so the majority is in operating expense and in the reorganization of the corporate organization that i've just talked about. so that's what's driving it, and it's about the 3 things i said. it's anticipating post-refranchising, it's the impacts of technology, and it's the choices on what work we're doing, doing the work differently. that's what's driving the extra $800 million. now the $800 million -- the comment around reinvesting half was related to the $800 million very specifically. so that's, that one. now obviously, we've seen some margin expansion. i mean, implicit in our guidance this year already is some dropping of the base productivity program through into margin because you'll calculate that the revenue currency-neutral structural is at the 3 and that when you take operating income is substantially higher than that, then obviously, that's offset by some negative financing leverage. so as -- the '14, '15 and '16, i think you're largely right. in '17, you're seeing much more drop into operating leverage. and the comment is about the $800 million going forward, half -- a little over half is reinvested. as it relates to refranchising, we do not -- we still believe we can meet the deadline and get the u.s. refranchised this year. of course, we're not going to do the wrong deals for the sake of hitting a date. but we think the right deals are possible, and we think that we are still on track with our plan. and as you say, we're seeing benefits in the refranchised territories. i'm not sure i would give a specific number that can be kind of inserted over the top on everything else. but clearly, the idea of reorientating and rebuilding the u.s. system so that it's stronger, and putting in place the different pieces, the manufacturing, the governance, the it, the way the system works, support our long-term strategy of rational pricing and some growth for continued revenue growth in the u.s. is underpinned by the success of the refranchisings in the u.s. and obviously, we closed out on the 1st of april in china and the merger of the japanese bottlers.
38;6;257;2;0.007782101167315175;so firstly, laurent, i hate to disappoint you, but we're not going to be disclosing that the starting point and break down the geographic groups as well by cluster and have all of that laid out. the goals by cluster, clearly, we have goals by cluster. the more they move from sparkling, the more they move from the things we've been building over the last 15 years, the faster we expect the percentage growth rate. but in terms in absolute, it is worth remembering that sparkling, still in absolute terms, provides the greatest incremental amount of revenue to the corporation of any one category. and the -- as i said, just let me make a detailed point. the growth officer, we're not moving to an operating model where we're having global category p&ls and running the business through global category p&ls. the operating model decision is to run the business locally, to drive local entrepreneurship and empowerment of the operating units but to use the growth opportunity setup to be strategic to make sure that we stay connected to what's happening when you take a top-down perspective or a category perspective and have the ripened -- and some authority on bringing those insights and those needs and those initiatives to the table so that when -- we, as the corporation, we're not going to try and run everything for the operating units, but we will make a few strategic bets, and some of those will be driven from the cluster approach.
38;7;210;0;0.0;sure. i think the principal difference on the reinvestment of the half of the $800 million is up to now, i would say the majority of what we've done has gone into the sparkling category business around the world. i think here, the clear intent is that this is more directed to some of the newer categories or some of the other categories to drive growth there. so it's principally orientated around growth of the other categories. that's the headline answer there. then in terms of the north american sparkling pricing, as you say, that's -- as we called out, that's principally timing, and it's really related to the different channels. the price, the average -- obviously, we have a large fountain operation, which we run directly in north america. and so the timing of gallon shipments, whether they go to the bottlers or through the fountain business, can move the average price/mix by north america. and it's the timing around those gallons that has created that unusually lower 1%, and that's the majority of the difference between what we would expect to happen on sparkling pricing and what actually you see in the first quarter north america. and that should correct itself.
38;8;281;5;0.017793594306049824;yes. look, i do not think i would say this is a kind of a night-and-day change for us. look, we've been on the journey for us to expand our portfolio. i think this is about making the commitment to press further and faster and make -- kind of make the full kind of psychological journey, too. this is about a full set of categories and responding to the consumer, not a central portfolio with some periphery. we're making good progress with coca-cola european partners. obviously, we did a lot of planning last year at the setup of the new bottler and its integration and the plans for the marketplace. i think you've seen a number of actions, whether it's the rolling out of smartwater, the launch of honest tea, where we've taken some proactive steps with them in different categories. but also, i would underline we've been very proactive with european partners on coke, coca-cola zero sugar, which drove a lot of growth in gb in this quarter. so we've got a great new bottler that's been stood up. we're broadening the portfolio. we're taking action across more categories, and i think that's part of the future. now would i say that's the one place to look at? no. i think if you look at the u.s. or japan, to take 2 other examples, you'll see a broader portfolio. and that's continuing to invest and expand across categories and even within categories, resegmenting each category for multiple different reasons to drive value growth for ourselves, the bottlers and collectively as a system.
38;9;193;2;0.010362694300518135;i'll go in reverse order. i mean, the incentive structure is balanced between the top line and the bottom line today. having said that, we're going to take this year to have a fundamental relook at our total compensation approach. that may result in no changes whatsoever. we may end up going, "there's no perfect solution, and the one we've got is the right one," or we may make some tweaks. that is yet to be determined. but it is worth noting, the incentives are half top line effectively and half bottom line. in terms of the tangible benefits, i mean, we're obviously not going to provide guidance for '18 and '19 and beyond at this stage. having said that, we've been pretty clear that we want to be in our long-term growth model in terms of the top line and have some leverage within that. so to the extent that we've guided for 3% this year, we would be disappointed if the opportunities in the marketplace and the macros offered us opportunity to get back into our range, and we did not achieve it.
38;10;211;6;0.02843601895734597;sure. we've been steadily learning and getting better at the zero-based work over the last number of years. i think we can get -- getting better at doing less one-off events then do not necessarily always think we're getting much better at making it part of our discipline of going, how do we use the resources available for the best means possible to get the results we're after? so i think that's been a steady organizational learning process that's been going on. the latest changes are just another iteration. the $800 million is another iteration of that. every year, we look at it. the back end of last year, we looked at the strategy evolutions coming up, imagining the post-refranchise world, the impacts of technology. and we just considered what we could do and how we could do things differently, and that's reflected in the strategy. and as part of the strategy, it's reflected in the organizational changes we are making and the increased productivity savings. we will continue to run the zero-based work process and be clear that the efficient use of resources is one of the ways to drive the top line and to enable long-term value creation.
38;11;225;1;0.0044444444444444444;well, on m&a, i mean, we have a track record of doing bolt-on acquisitions over the years. i think there should be a reasonable expectation that they will continue at some sort of similar rate. larger opportunities, i think about are they logical. they have to be strategic, they have to be financially viable and they have to be available. as and when things are -- meet those 3 criteria, we will look harder at them. and that's as much as i can say at this stage. in terms of retailers in the u.s., look, i think they are looking -- they have their own -- each one has their own strategies, their own positions slightly differently. so i do not think one can look at them in an aggregate and say they're always trying to do the same thing. i think pricing rationalization is certainly our strategy. we are engaged with customers in how it fits their strategies, each one individually. and largely, i would say that we're finding how to create value together. are there risks that for competitive reasons by customers or competitive reasons by our competitors, something happens in some quarters to knock that off course? yes. but that risk is -- has existed and still exists, but we're clear on where we're trying to get to.
38;12;287;9;0.0313588850174216;sure. i think look, in -- we talked at cagny, we have about a 50% share of the sparkling category. and of all the other categories, we're somewhere between a 10% and 15% share on a global basis. but even that's a very average number. you can go to some parts of the world, and we are clear market leaders at the same sort of share levels that we have in sparkling in other parts of the world we're operating. so there's not a short answer, except to say that we have -- we are going through and have gone through and always updating the process of looking at where are the next stages of growth, both bottom-up, each country going, "look, i think i need to grow out this category or that category" SEMICOLON and top-down, both a global view and a category view, saying, "look, if we want to progress, actually, we think we need to push out smartwater into more countries or tea, for example, honest tea into more countries." and that's the intersection of the global growth perspective and the country perspective. and then evolution of profitability in juice, probably depends whether we build the business through bolt-on acquisitions or whether we did it from scratch. either way, the evolution is, as you'd expect, as we build a good, either leadership position or a close #2, we tend to come into much, much more attractive profitability status, which is why, if we have small positions in categories, we've either got to get up, have a clear path to leadership or a strong #2 or not overinvest because being subscale is not our path to profitability.
39;1;209;4;0.019138755980861243;yes. i think the -- we've said that we're going to manage the year, and we're going to try and pull into that balance the obvious building of the business over the long term. we have stated that we'd like to get out of the trend of declining eps, which has been the last few years, and that we are going to invest where it makes sense. so we are constantly looking at where that places our momentum, and should we invest more, and we have done so. and we have increased our plans in the downhill in a couple of places where we see really good momentum and a good reason to invest for better results. but the world remains volatile, and there are places where the environment is better suited to affordability, to returnables, to adjustments. and where markets are, just frankly, under a lot of macro pressure, extra investment is not going to drive us very far. so we will continue to manage it with flexibility. we know that going forward, we'll have some of the money we're going to generate out of lean enterprise to look across the portfolio, but we're going to decide that on an ongoing basis.
39;2;230;2;0.008695652173913044;yes, sure. i think a couple of things. on an as-reported basis, you will indeed see an acceleration in the back half, principally because we have an extra day in the fourth quarter, and we had the less days in the first quarter. so i think as you look at the reported numbers, there will be some acceleration. now underlying that and seeing it in its most simple sense of taking unit cases and price/mix, as you say, we did roughly 3 in the first quarter and roughly 3 this quarter. we're guiding to 3 for the rest of the year because frankly, the world has not changed. we are doing a lot of the right things in the places that are going well, and frankly, there are some of the ones that need to be fixed. but we do not see the world as improving rapidly, and therefore, we're not banking on that happening. and so we're more focused on doing what we know needs to be done and having a moderate view of how that's going to play out in the rest of the year. and i think the expectation for the downhill should be more of the same of what we've had so far this year, hopefully with some of those macro situations improving as we get towards the end.
39;3;167;8;0.04790419161676647;yes. so i think the headline answer is yes, it's happening, and i think it was part of the design and the strategy. to be fair to the team running ccr, they have been improving their operations of coca-cola refreshments over the years and have been getting increasingly better results over time and doing a lot of the things that set the platform for better local operations and better coordinated national operations. but there's no question that as the bottlers have taken over these new territories, they have been very energetic in trying to improve them. they've made good progress, particularly in some of the non-directly measured channels, the up and down the street, the smaller stores, where they build on their local expertise. so i think it is, in aggregate, a tailwind. it was part of the strategy that it should be that way, and i think it's a compliment to the local bottlers that they are driving that forward.
39;4;270;2;0.007407407407407408;so the operating margin expansion, the 375 basis points, i mean, clearly, we see that we are -- that operating margins have expanded when you see that we are at 6% of profit before tax and on organic revenues of 3. yes, that is driven by that price/mix. and so you know exactly where the price/mix came from in terms of there's a lot of it being driven by north america and emea and -- in this quarter. and then timing of sg&a expenses, yes, part of that is -- yes, it will (inaudible) over the balance of the year, but that was not really the bulk of what was driving that. it's more about the productivity and cost management that we have in the year. so we have more plans over the next couple of years for additional -- for the rest of the productivity. and that will continue to drive operating margin expansion. first, just the refranchising itself drives -- has driven a lot of that 375 basis points. as we have gotten out of the capital-intensive businesses, the more people-intensive businesses, that specifically drove that 375 basis points. so we had guided to the fact that our operating margins were going to go up after the refranchising. we plan to be in that range and continue to look for, obviously, other opportunities to increase operating margins as we go forward. but -- so basically, think about it as the refranchising driving most of that, good price/mix and the cost management and the productivity that we will continue to get over the next couple of years.
39;5;265;9;0.033962264150943396;yes, sure. i think we're very happy that we're doing well in teas and coffees both globally and in north america. obviously, the dunkin' one is early days, good start. i think gold peak is a good tea brand, and again, an early start on the coffee. the basis of our kind of ready-to-drink coffee business, the -- its strong global position is actually asia. so we have some strong brands there. so i do not think you should see it as there's going to be one brand for ready-to-drink coffee and ready-to-drink tea across the world. we're going to see some strong growth coming out of asia in asian teas. yes, we're launching honest tea in europe as the joint venture with nestlé winds down on teas in the european space at the end of the year. so you will see us use some of our brands more broadly, but it will not be one brand everywhere. net-net, we're positive on the long-term growth opportunity for both ready-to-drink teas and coffees. we'll end up with a portfolio of brands, particularly as it relates to different geographies. and each will have its own positioning, but in the end, the consumer will decide the one it wants. and if all work, great. if 2 work, then we'll take one out. maybe we'll bring one more in. but we'll continue to pay attention to what the consumer wants and help customers grow their businesses by selling our brands.
39;6;450;0;0.0;sure. i mean, i'll give you a couple of ideas, but i think the net of the answer is it's more of a cultural process than a process process. having said that, we're clear on when we're talking about test-and-learn or experiment, that people need to understand the scale and the potential impacts of the experiments they're undertaking. in other words, we are starting to use some frameworks to classify how people are going after things. so said in simple terms, if the test you're undertaking is not life-threatening, do lots of them, learn quickly and move on. i mean, if the experiment, it potentially creates a material risk if it goes wrong, then let's look at it more closely. so we're starting to push through some ways of looking at the portfolio and the market so they can categorize what sort of strategy and what sort of scale of experiment that they're undertaking, whether it's a launch of a product or a new marketing program, et cetera, et cetera. and so the risk can be managed appropriately, and it's all about what's the potential downside to the corporation and that if it's not big, or said differently, if it's very small, then it's okay to let them go. but as i said at the beginning of the answer, it's mainly a cultural mindset. it's the essential idea that the world is undergoing some important structural changes, multiple ones at the same time, and that is causing disruptions on many fronts. and we have to continue to do what we've done for 130-plus years, which is stay relevant to the consumer and help our customers grow their businesses. and that's cultural. so we need people to really be focused on where do we stand really, to be curious about what's going on in the world, to kind of look -- not look at things through rose-tinted glasses and come to quick conclusions and move on. why? not because it's -- we fancy it and it's a nice thing to have. it's because that's what's needed in the marketplace. and i think the employees understand that. i think that's why the lean enterprise is resonating, and i think that's why it'll get pushed through. and we'll back that up with some tools and processes to help people. we're making much more embedded into the organization the use of real agile processes and agile teams because that's the way that we're going to get to answers quicker.
39;7;131;1;0.007633587786259542;yes. yes, yes, we saw some weakness in kind of the water and sports drinks categories in the second quarter. some of that was weather in may. there was a particularly poor period there. i do not like throwing the weather under the bus, but that's for q2. i think in the longer-term trend, we'll -- i think water will continue to grow. particularly enhanced water, premium waters, i think you see a lot of activity by ourselves, by competitors in that space. so i think that is going to come back and will continue to be a source of growth for the industry. and we will participate very competitively, and it will be a source of growth for us. so i think it's a moment in time.
39;8;225;3;0.013333333333333334;sure. clearly, i'm not going to say that 4% is the projectable price/mix for the u.s. i think that's at the top end of what would happen. i think it's important as you look at the u.s. result, i mean, clearly, it was a good quarter. and we're pleased that it comes on top of multiple years of the u.s. business performing at the top end of large consumer products companies. a couple of points that are very important to note. firstly, we benefited in the second quarter from a little bit of extra gallons in the food service business that was kind of inventory, call that a point. so it's really more of at 4%. now we're getting a lot of that in the non-measured channels. we're getting it through the small packs. it's about a balance between mix and rates. we've got transaction packs growing mid-single digits in the quarter, high single digits year-to-date in sparkling. so it really is a bit of a sweet spot between rate and mix. as i said, it will not stay up at that high level because of the effect of the extra food service gallons. but they are executing strategy, and i think it's playing out very nicely.
39;9;245;3;0.012244897959183673;yes. let me start with asia and then walk towards japan, lauren. i think there was some softness in asia. we'd have liked to see asia come in better. i would call out obviously the slight disruption in india from the general sales tax, obviously affected us in the back end of the quarter. as i said in the opening remarks, we think that's good for the country, but it did obviously make some impact in the second quarter. and we're seeing softness across some of the asean countries. each has their own reasons, but the asean region has been soft. china bounced back a little bit. japan had a solid quarter. it was not knocking it out of the park like it has on some of the previous ones. there are some kind of cycling things in there, but we've had some good launches with some local products in japan. coca-cola foshu, it needs more time than i have now to explain it, but pretty solid results. year-to-date, japan is going reasonably well. obviously, we've got the new bottler coming into being, which sort of affects the inventories that we sell into them, which kind of makes it looks like they're not doing as well as they should. but i think japan is going to continue to do well. china bounced back. so coming back to the beginning, it's really about india and asean.
39;10;199;1;0.005025125628140704;yes. thanks, kevin. look, i think a couple of factors. just mechanically, if brazil and venezuela had been flat in the quarter, we'd have grown a point faster. so i mean to say, okay, well, by next year, venezuela will have declined so much it will not matter. and brazil, i think there's some belief that it will get better as we come out of the year. so if you want it on a mechanical basis, [you go yes]. mathematically, if everything else stays roughly the same, then we'll get there next year as brazil and venezuela [sober]. now other countries could fall off the wagon, and so that's always an uncertainty. having said that, our underlying core revenue growth, organic growth in the second quarter was actually 4%. so if you strip out the bottling operations that we know we're going to sell, we talked about the core growing 4% last year. it grew 4% in this quarter. so i think, in there is the seeds of that number as we go into 2018. we're not making a projection on 2018 yet, but i think underlying are the breadcrumbs towards that conclusion.
39;11;163;3;0.018404907975460124;look, i think clearly, the company's role is to provide some leadership to the system and, obviously, the marketing -- the brands, the marketing and the innovation to create the business in the countries that they operate in. so to the extent the company does not do that, it's always going to be a problem on alignment. similarly, the bottlers not taking advantage of when there are all those things and investing in execution, investing in the capabilities to develop the marketplace, to expand the number of outlets, to build a stronger base of cold drink equipment and the sales capability to help the customers develop their businesses, then there'll be alignment problems. so net-net, both sides need to come to the table with their piece of the equation and get it done. and when either side slips, yes, we have more robust conversations, but this is a business that really works well when both are coming to the table.
39;12;253;3;0.011857707509881422;sure. i mean, i think, firstly, it's gone really well. i mean, global volume growth for coke zero sugar has stepped up over the last few years to mid-single digits to high single digits, and now it's running in the teens. so it's done well in western europe, and that's really good. but actually, the global growth continues to accelerate, and we think it has a long way to go. and in terms of bringing it to the u.s., of course, we're bringing it to the u.s. because we think it'll do better and help the u.s. business grow. and you asked a question about, are we phasing out? so it is a reinvention of coke zero, and it is a slight repositioning. and yes, it is about helping the zero-calorie part of the portfolio grow, which is linked to playing a role in tackling obesity, and by that, i mean part of what we call the one-brand strategy. so coke zero sugar, of course, is an improved version of the coke zero sugar formula, but it comes in more of a red visual identity, more of a red can with more of a red label and will actually help people stay in the coca-cola franchise, and whether they want the original with sugar or they want a coke zero sugar without any, and it's less switching between brands, which will ultimately help us keep and attract more consumers.
39;13;417;14;0.03357314148681055;yes. good question, carlos. look, i think the first thing is it's got to be clear to the associates why we want change rather than just asking for it. and so part of the task is helping everyone understand the business necessity of the need to change. as i mentioned earlier, the world is undergoing a lot of structural change. and what it's driving towards is a place where the speed at which consumers, customers and the rate at which insights can be generated from data to give competitive advantage is changing such that the cycle of speed, experimentation and learning will create higher business value. i mean, firstly, you have to land the idea that it's got an ultimate competitive and business value underpinning rather than, "i prefer x versus y." how do you drive it forward? well, clearly, in order to get that done, you do need some technical skills. we'll need more consumer digital engagement-type skills, more e-commerce-type skills, more artificial intelligence-type skills and more collaboration-type skills. and in terms of the behaviors, in order to take advantage of that competitive cycle, you need greater transparency. so we need to push behaviors where the information is made available more broadly, more transparently, more quickly. we need to keep encouraging a candor of looking at where [we] really are opportunities and issues, no rose-tinted glasses because then you get to the insight quicker. that's got to go along with a greater curiosity. we've got a -- one of the dangers of being 130-plus years successful is you think you got the answer to some things, whereas we really need to have lots of curiosity about how things could be different, could be better and how we respond to the way things are changing. and then of course, it's -- there needs to be some courage to try new things. i talked earlier about that's going to be managed with risk appetite, all experiments are not born equal, and there'll be lots of tolerance for doing it in a sensible way. and then commitment to making things better, and i think all of that can be created. of course, the tone needs to be set from the top. we need to put in place the training and the programs. and if people understand why, i think you get a much more empowered autonomous organization that's capable of creating a better future.
39;14;230;4;0.017391304347826087;yes, let me talk about the question around the bottling system and refranchising. the -- firstly, yes, there are some legacy small bottlers, but principally, the u.s. bottling system, by the end of this year, will be a relatively small number of bottlers, distributed in a very logical geographic distribution across the country, which has moved away from the great mosaic of the past -- of the patchwork group. i think then what we will have if people are really strong locally in their [bottling] places where they know what to do -- and the u.s. is not one place. there are lots of local differences. but the important element of the strategy in the u.s. is the putting in place of the structures and mechanisms so the system can act as one, act as one with customers, act as one from a production system, act as one in terms of ip, act as one in terms of really working out what's the strategy. so it will be a strong combination of local knowledge and the ability to act across the system. it's in place. i think they've done a great job over the last several years in bringing it to life and delivering top-class results in the u.s. environment. and i think that's going to continue to be the system of the future.
40;1;352;5;0.014204545454545454;yes, sure, dara. look, a few thoughts. firstly, i think the most important thing we focus on as a starting point is making sure we are bringing the innovation, the marketing and the execution to bear for each customer such that the beverage category grows faster than their overall business. and that is the basis on which you get better in-store placements, execution, and the pricing conversation becomes more manageable because the end, you're -- in the end, you're creating disproportionate value for the customer. so that's the first objective. the second point i would make is we -- perhaps different to some people, we are a very multichannel business. yes, we have large presence in the grocery channel, but we have multiple other environments where we sell our beverages. and therefore, part of it is being in lots of different places that helps manage the pack/price architecture dynamics and creates value for all our customers in the different channels. and i would perhaps leave a last third thought on the marketplace, which is, yes, some of the extra pressures are from private labels or the stratification of retailers' own strategy in pricing is somewhat of an emerging dynamic in the u.s., but it has been present in other parts of the world, and we have found ways to work with each of our customers to make it work for them and for us. so we are believers in our ability to create value for ourselves by creating value with the customers even in this ongoing changing environment. and i'll leave you with the last thought, which is there's no one better positioned to understand this in the context of north america than jim dinkins because he's run the national sales company for the u.s. system for a large number of years. he's worked as -- leading accounts in lots of other channels, too. so he understands this dynamic very clearly, and he has been at the forefront of leading a team to build value with our customers in collaboration with our bottling system.
40;2;203;4;0.019704433497536946;i -- well, i think the first and most important green shoot is to look at the performance once you get past the 12-month mark, by which i mean that it's much like having any new thing, management attention and focus gets heavily directed to new things. and so of course, you would expect better performance initially on refranchising, and we have got that in the vast majority of territories. but i think the most interesting thing is that after 12 months when it's cycling and people have got the real hard work of building for the long term, we're still seeing the vast majority of the refranchised territories performing ahead of where they were before. so they've been able to build on the great refoundation work that ccr, in conjunction with the north american team, did. and the sorts of places we're seeing that performance coming from is not just doing better with the existing customers, which is true, but also in finding new customer outlets, expanding the universe of the customer outlets and performing better in the small formats, which in a way is partly the theory of the case of why refranchise to local partners.
40;3;155;4;0.025806451612903226;yes. i mean, i'm not going to get into the mathematical specificity, but i think, look, the headline is that as coke zero sugar is coming to marketplaces, and particularly interesting those ones where it's been there for more than 12 months, a bit like my comment on refranchising, we're seeing continued acceleration of coke zero sugar. it's lifting the whole franchise. yes, it is cannibalizing at times either coke light or sometimes coke original, but in the net, there is additional volume and additional consumers coming back into the franchise. i think it's unrealistic to expect cannibalization to be 0, but obviously, the key is that it be a net positive. so we're pleased with how it's playing out. it's slightly different in different countries, depending on the mix of the coke franchise in those countries, but it's a net positive, and we are encouraged.
40;4;236;0;0.0;okay. so i will take the first one, and james can decide if he plans to be generous or not. so first of all, we separate those 2 programs, ali, from the $3 billion program, the original program that we announced earlier and then the $800 million program that we added on. on the $3 billion program, i would say we are on target, that the productivity is clearly coming from 3 different places: cost of goods, dme and opex. and we have targets to do about -- around $400 million this year. and we had always said about half of that would be reinvested and -- to drive growth. of the $800 million program, that is associated with our lean enterprise activities. those activities really just got started last quarter, so this year. so it -- they really will -- and we've said that you'll see the benefits of those in 2018 and '19, and they will be split between those 2 years. and again, about half of that will go to reinvestment, and half will hit the bottom line. so we are on target with both programs, and the lean enterprise programs have started off well so far. and we will plan to update you as we continue to go along. and if we have time, we'll come back to topo chico, ali, so that we can respect everyone's one question at a time.
40;5;270;4;0.014814814814814815;sure. i mean, firstly, we over-index in terms of share, generally speaking, online. i think the second thing i would say is e-commerce is not one thing SEMICOLON it's a spectrum. and in part, what i mean by that is there are pure-play e-commerce players. there are bricks-and-mortars who have e-commerce. and you could say that's the omnichannel. there are aggregators -- remember, we're not just grocery. we work with a lot of restaurants, and there are all sorts of restaurant aggregator platforms and restaurants or some qsr chains have their own platforms as well. so there's a wide spectrum of different versions of how consumers are interacting with customers that is digitally enabled. as i said, we very generally over-index. our objective is to work with each customer, helping them drive value for the beverage category with their consumers. and generally speaking, we do better when that happens. and so you can see progress in the traditional grocery idea of e-commerce, whether omnichannel or pure play. you can see progress on restaurant or quick-service platforms. so there's a lot of growth, a lot of activity. but in the simplest sense, it comes back to the central idea: if we can work with them to help the beverage business grow faster than their overall business and be a key participant, it creates a lot of value for them. and therefore, we have a lot of engagement with many of these companies on how can we help create value for them within the context of their strategy.
40;6;404;5;0.012376237623762377;yes. i think let me take them in pieces as each one is a slightly different story although i -- the headline is i'm hoping to see the light at the end of the tunnel by the end of the year. what does that mean? in brazil, we've talked about the actions we've been taking around price/package architecture, around returnables, investing in new infrastructure, not overpromoting to try and protect the volume but to try and reestablish our price/pack architecture that's going to work for the medium term. it's -- brazil as a country is struggling or has struggled. there are some signs, as i commented on the script, of light at the end of the tunnel. fmcg is lagging durables a bit in that. am i completely happy in brazil? no, i would not say so. i think there's more that we can do that's within our control. but i'm still somewhat hopeful that, that will all play out by the end of the year and things will start bottoming out in the fourth quarter. it has been sequentially improving as we've gone through the year. i think with more focus and more effort, we can see this play through, and so it'll bottom out by the end of the year. we'll see, but i think the signs are encouraging. venezuela. venezuela is really a very tough human situation. it's almost a tragedy. and i think that the simple reality is the fourth quarter of significant declines in venezuela will be the fourth quarter this year, at which point it'll have got to -- it'll have shrunk to a size that it will not be able to impact our overall numbers to the same extent in 2018. i would love to think it's going to get better. i'm not hopeful in the short term, but i would say it's going to stop impacting our numbers heavily once we get into 2018. and then colombia, similarly to brazil. so i think the sum of all that is what i said at the beginning. we've been through a very tough year. we've been taking action. we are happy with some of the things we've done. we've got more work to do in places. but the floor should be set by the end of the year.
40;7;399;14;0.03508771929824561;i think there're a few questions in there, judy. look, i think as we disaggregate the categories, obviously, the categories intersect with the geographies. and so the story is not -- neither clean by geography nor by category. but let me try and add a little texture to what we see going on. i think sparkling beverage growth got a little bit better volumetrically in the quarter, and i think that, that shows a slightly improving trend. so i think that's -- firstly, the sparkling has got volumetrically better. it's back to slightly across the 0 line, whereas it was negative at the beginning of the year, and that's coming with better revenue growth. so our focus on coke zero sugar, the relaunch of fanta, sprite in some places, smaller packages, working with customers who are getting a better volume trend sequentially and good pricing. so i think there's good progress there. in terms of juices, what we're really seeing there is doing a lot better on the top end, things like chilled juices, plant-based drinks, fairlife, the premium dairy, going strongly, would love to have more capacity to grow even faster. you're seeing some growth in the juice drinks end of the spectrum where there's some volume has come out. it's more in the nectars, and i think that's part of people converting up and converting down. so i think there's continued trend there. in terms of teas, good growth there, volume growth, price growth. we're pleased with our performance in teas. we're going to continue to invest in tea. coffee, lots of up in coffee. in the u.s., we've launched our own brands. we've launched some brands in partnerships with some other players. all of those have gone successfully well. we've got new innovations coming. we did -- we had a bit of a bump in coffee in japan in the quarter, not so pleased about that. but we have the plans in place to do better. the one where we have done less well, and it was a choiceful decision, is on water. in some parts of the world where we have been too heavily into very low-margin, large-bulk water, we have pulled back deliberately in the quarter, and that has affected some of our water growth rate numbers.
40;8;254;1;0.003937007874015748;so yes. i mean, we're going to reaccelerate smartwater. look, i think the key in terms of north america is to see a bit of a trend on the price/mix. you'll remember from last quarter, for example, that we talked about a point of the revenue growth was extra inventory in our fountain business ahead of the summer. obviously, that's been backed out in the third quarter. so said in simple terms, i think the easiest way to understand north america and look through inventory and look through natural disasters is, if they look to summer as the period, let's add the second quarter and the third quarter together and look at what we've got. and there, i could -- i think you can see revenue is 3% to 4%, price/mix is on average 3%, which is in line with the year-to-date trend and is in line with what we did in previous years, more or less. but i think when you just look past some of the blips, what you see is an ongoing successful track record of driving the north american strategy SEMICOLON reinvigorating the portfolio SEMICOLON a focus on revenue SEMICOLON a focus on smaller packages SEMICOLON a focus ultimately that drives price/mix ahead of volume, with transactions ahead of volume. and i think that's what you saw once you ignore the blips in the third quarter. and so we're committed to our strategy, and we continue to drive it.
40;9;231;4;0.017316017316017316;look, i think we got -- the north american market is certainly one of the most competitive markets around the world. it's not just one large competitor we face. there are multiple competitors, large, medium and small. there's a lot of activity, a lot of innovation, a lot of jockeying. in the end, we will continue to focus on our strategy. we have a clear strategy that's driving the portfolio inspired by the consumer, working with customers to create value for the beverage category and our underlying category because that includes all peoples, brands and products. we work with the customers to create value for the beverage category, which will drive ultimately growth. and i think that has shown that we have been able to gain share over the long term on a steady basis as we have deployed this strategy, supported, of course, by the increased and improved bottler execution investment through the refranchising. it's a long-term game plan. i've commented on previous quarterly calls, will there occasionally be quarters where customers take certain decisions that cause disruption to that or competitors do? of course, that may happen, and we will respond. but we believe in our strategy, we think it's the right long-term play, and we will always look to get back to it even if we respond to short-term actions.
40;10;235;10;0.0425531914893617;i think the top part of the answer is it's -- all the pieces work together. it's about having the right portfolio for the consumers, the right marketing, the right innovation and the right execution. there's no question that when you bring all those things together, that's when you get the best possible result. in terms of what better execution from the refranchised bottlers, i think that they have been able to build on the foundation that was created by the ccr team. that was -- we pushed more devolution of accountability, of empowerment down into the organization of this national bottling company. we were -- refounded some of the manufacturing, supply chain and executional processes. and i think the local bottlers have been able to take that, bringing their passion, their entrepreneurialism, their local knowledge, and turned that into an even better result. as i mentioned earlier, that's typified by things like more outlets, typified by things like working better with the smaller formats, yet also, at the same time, being able to increase the degree of execution and service to some of the larger customers. so it's been an ability to work across the board. it was not a silver bullet. it was, in fact, getting a little bit better across the spectrum, from the largest customers to the smallest customers, in support of our portfolio marketing and innovation plan.
40;11;283;13;0.045936395759717315;so yes, it's safe to assume that we're going to invest where we see the opportunity for growth. and therefore, as the emerging markets begin to bounce back, i'm not sure they're all are going to bounce back to the same sort of degree as they were precrisis, but we absolutely will be investing to drive our market position. now i would just underline that other than some situations very specifically, we do not tend to try and pull back very aggressively when markets turn down. we, generally speaking, adopt the strategy of when there's a downturn, and particularly, in some of the emerging markets, it's better to invest through it to gain competitive position so that you're positioned even better for the upturn. so it's not the case that we pulled the cord on lots of markets. having said that, as i said at the beginning, we will up the investment as we start to see the acceleration, and you can see that we've talked about things we started to do in india, things we started to do in china. as we see the momentum starting to come back, we're investing behind those. will it be across the portfolio? yes. it will not be -- [shock them]. it needs to be focused on helping us achieve category leadership positions or near-leadership positions or driving new interest in consumer innovation in conjunction with the execution of our bottling partners. we're not trying to do more mediocre stuff. we're trying to generate good strong consumer brands, whether they be large or they be niche, whether they be profitable and they be successful.
40;12;195;4;0.020512820512820513;i think, in western europe, we've had a very good start to the creation of ccep. yes, it was a little bouncy in the third quarter with some localized poor weather that offset the better weather that was in q2. if you look past those blips, i think you see momentum in western europe coming back in and good growth. i've talked previously about expectations on price/mix where in western europe, i think we can have, in comparison perhaps to the u.s., a little more volume growth and therefore a little more balance between volume and price in europe as we go forward. the u.s. is more assertively looking for a package/price architecture mix-led part of the equation. so i think that the sustained idea for western europe is a balance. in terms of china and africa, there are slightly different situations. in africa, clearly, there's more opportunity for expansion of the portfolio volumetrically although of course, there'll be a price/mix element. and china is, again, a place where we're looking to get -- rebuild the volume momentum with a moderate degree of price/mix.
40;13;226;2;0.008849557522123894;yes. i mean, there's -- i mean, clearly, the natural disasters in the whole caribbean basin, whether we're talking florida, texas, puerto rico or mexico with the earthquakes, all kind of occurred in the same quarter. so there's clearly an impact. i'm not going to attach a number to it because i'm not really a big fan of putting it all into the one-off temporary basket. but clearly, there was an impact. the weather was a bit more miserable in the third quarter. and there is a bit of -- there was a bit of softening of consumer sentiment through the third quarter in mexico. i do not think these are new enduring trends. i mean, certainly not the natural disasters, hopefully not, but nor is the consumer one. i think that will slowly reverse over the balance of the year. we'll see. so i do not think there's a big issue in mexico. of course, it's one of those places, too, where we're looking to work on our price/package architecture and the full portfolio that we've developed as a system over the last few decades there to really be able to continue to drive revenue. and i think it was a strong revenue quarter for the system in mexico, and i think that will continue.
40;14;270;5;0.018518518518518517;look, i think the leadership change in north america -- i mean, leaders do not last forever, and this is another one of those changes. there's a new chapter about to begin in north america. we've had a great run of a few years. we've successfully carried out a humongous refranchising task. and i think sandy made the decision this time for a new leader, and i think jim is the right person. he's got full portfolio experience. he's got marketing experience. he knows the customers across the whole spectrum, and he has the right capabilities as a leader to take us to the next stage of growth. what does that need to be? clearly, it needs to be about continuing to execute the strategy we've got in place. but like all strategies, they need to evolve. in the same way that company's global strategy evolves for the circumstances we face, so will the north american one. it's not just due to the fact of the leader changes that you know you need to continue to evolve and build new capabilities. we knew that before. we had some things under development. of course, we'll learn new things, and we'll identify new ideas. so i think it's about a continued journey of the north american business. it's a great team. it's a great system. they've got their mojo back. they know they need to do more things to execute and complete the mission in the short term and to evolve and build new capabilities for the long term.
40;15;325;6;0.018461538461538463;yes. look, i think it's not just a u.s. trend. you can look at japan where arguably, beverage diversity is even greater than the u.s. but i think the central point is the following. if you look back over time and you look at what is the behavior of teens and young adults of each generation as it comes through, there's one key fact: each generation consumes and, importantly, buys more commercial beverages than the previous one. the second important fact is they do so across a greater variety of drinks. it's not that they buy more commercial beverages and drink ever-increasing amounts of the same thing. they go for diversity. therefore, you can see around the world that those places which have the highest amounts of disposable income, each generation is coming along and looking for that diversity. that's true in the u.s. it's true in japan. it's true in other developed markets and other wealthy parts of even emerging markets. and so the learnings that are available are actually not just one-directional. they are actually from many different places across the world. we've got to find ways to take new learnings from the u.s., from other parts, japan, from europe, from australia and finding the best of the best and allowing ourselves to fuel the diversity of the portfolio yet understanding that, in the end, what grows are the global brands. i mean, the world, over the last number of years, has been typified, at least in beverages, by outsized growth by global brands and the entry of lots of new smaller brands. the bit in the middle was tougher. so you either have to -- so you have to keep fueling the machine by having innovation and testing the frontier of variety yet, over time, graduating those to large-scale consumer franchises, not necessarily single-flavor franchises but consumer franchises.
40;16;2;0;0.0;yes. yes.
40;17;156;1;0.00641025641025641;no, that's the wrong conclusion, andrew. the simple answer is that the regulatory process in south africa is not time regulated. and the fact is we got regulatory clearance in the last month or so, and that then led us to closing. and now we will proceed to work with our -- the prospective partners that are interested, and there's substantive interest. and when we say 2018, that's because it includes regulatory and closing approval. so that's the simple answer. so i think that's it. that's time, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for joining in. to conclude, i think we delivered a solid quarter. we're on track to close out a successful year. and as always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us. and again, we look forward to sharing with you more during our investor day on november 16. thank you.
41;1;170;1;0.0058823529411764705;obviously, this year -- 2013 will be peak capital investment in canada, about $1.5 billion. next year, going forward, capex -- for the us, we'd expect something similar, perhaps growing a little bit, to $2.5 billion, something in that range SEMICOLON canada dropping to somewhere -- still opening a fair number of stores -- $0.5 billion, perhaps a bit more than that. so we would expect free cash flow to expand, especially in light of canada operations becoming accretive. as far as what we would intend to do with that, we said first, by 2017, assuming we get to $8.00 a share, we'd expect the dividend to be at $3.00 a share or more. so we'd expect to continue to increase the dividend at a rate approximately 20% on a compound basis over the next several years. and with the constraint of living within our current strong investment grade credit ratings, we'd expect to deploy the remainder of our excess cash flow as share repurchase.
41;2;185;2;0.010810810810810811;yes. i think that's right, mark. when we look back on where we're at right now with canada, we feel really good about where we're at and our projections for returns in canada. if we look back a year ago, or even two years ago when we signed the deal, the projected ebitda for this quarter -- for this year, excuse me, is essentially right on where we thought it would be. the dilution is a bit higher even than we expected, perhaps a year ago SEMICOLON and all of that is attributable to independent capital investment decisions we've made, whether that's investing in three distribution centers to build them and own them ourselves, or the 40 store expansions that i mentioned that we worked through over the past year. so most of the increase, from our vantage point, is attributable to incremental depreciation and amortization. and of course, those capital investments were separate economic decisions and we expect to see economic benefit to that p&l through time. but the sequencing is that the depreciation and amortization shows up first.
41;3;49;1;0.02040816326530612;yes. the property development team did an outstanding job working with some very good partners, our landlords in canada. and the vast majority of the percent rent clauses, which of course never impacted zellers, have been negotiated away. percent rent is not a meaningful issue for us going forward.
41;4;80;0;0.0;i think what i would say, greg, is right now as we look at the retail business and model that, we've always modeled that independently of the credit business, given the different leverage characteristics, as you noted. we think the retail business right now is probably pretty close to the top end. there may be a little bit of room. but we think it's near about where the leverage which will support our current credit rating is at.
41;5;6;0;0.0;correct. for 2013, that's correct.
41;6;295;3;0.010169491525423728;sure. the increase in redcard sales is a mix of both, greg. certainly, the new accounts are creating a significant amount of that lift, with the amount of accounts. and you can see the increased penetration resulting from new accounts. but we have also seen an increase in lift, particularly over the first several quarters that the redcard was out, in existing accounts. the other thing i would mention, the big driver here of the increase in sales, as has been the case, the big driver in increase in the whole program, has been the debit card. and i think from our assumptions, perhaps two or three years ago when we were talking to you to you to now, the debit card is the one that has really surprised us. the credit card has probably grown pretty much with what we thought. but the debit card -- we're doing three accounts to one debit to credit now. and that has been the one -- the product that has been incredibly attractive to consumers who just do not want another credit card. and that's really what has driven the significant increase in our redcard sales. the other thing that i would add, greg, is all of our guest segments love the redcard somewhat equally, whether you are a vip, which we would say somebody that visits us a lot and spends a lot, all the way through our enthusiast convenience users least engaged. all of those segments, once they get the redcard, move toward visiting target more often and spending more. so this is not just isolated in one group of demographics. it's very well dispersed and balanced. and we think that's a very positive attribute that, that many guest segments love the redcard.
41;7;126;0;0.0;the actual assumption for the us business was about a 3% comp through time. and some years will be a little bit above that, some years a little bit below that. but we think 3% comp is about the right level for our business. if you look back at our business over a really, really long period of time, back when we were running 5% comps, a couple hundred basis points of that were coming from new stores as they annualized, and we would ran about a 3% comp in our base business. and over the last couple of years, since 2010 -- last year a little bit lower, 2011 right on. we feel like that's the right neighborhood for where we can run the business.
41;8;154;2;0.012987012987012988;well, typically in the us, we open stores in three cycles. due to the number of stores we have in canada, we're taking an approach that we're going to open five cycles this year. so think april, may, and every couple of months beyond that, we're going to open somewhere between 20 and 28 stores a cycle. we have not defined all of that yet. but we're going to start in the greater toronto area. then we're going to move to western canada. then we'll densify. then we'll go east, and then we'll densify again. so we've got a good plan that is centered around our supply chain investments and the readiness of our distribute centers, and we just think it makes sense to spread out those kinds of openings over more cycles than we typically would do in the us. your other question was --
41;9;149;1;0.006711409395973154;no. we're not holding back at all. we're not capital constrained, and we're pursuing every project that we can find that's going to generate the right kind of returns. so i would tell you that the real estate -- commercial real estate market is pretty much status quo and has not changed all that much over the last couple of years. there are pockets of opportunities, and we're anxious to either co-develop or develop on our own or be a partner in any development where we believe that it's the right demographics and we can generate the right kind of returns. so we're not holding back at all, it's just the environment is still a little cautious and a lot slower than we'd like it to be. and hopefully, things will change over the next couple of years. thank you.
41;10;117;0;0.0;the revenue number, i would tell you, continues to move around even here, for the reasons gregg just outlined. we continue to -- the store opening schedules continue to move around. we've only really set in place in concrete the first two. the rest of them, still moving around a little bit. so we're hesitant to provide pretty specific guidance. but what i would tell you is, the expectation is that these stores will open and grow and have a very similar annualization process to what we see in the us. so i think that's probably the most important assumption, and then the revenue will move around based on what stores we get open when.
41;11;53;0;0.0;i think you hit on it. it'll be a little bit longer. we're not talking about five years or anything like that. but 2.5, three years, something like that, our current modeling would say, we'll get it back in, something like that. so a bit more than two years.
41;12;466;7;0.015021459227467811;bob, i would say that we actually think we performed quite well on black friday. we saw the barbell intensify, as gregg mentioned, between those early sales in black friday and then the lull and then coming back strong at the end of the holiday. for us, it was more about pretty weak seasonal businesses. the weather, as you know, was warm. and our seasonal businesses, which normally kick in, in early november, did not. and then, with all of the, we think, economic turmoil and the elections and fiscal cliff and all of that, that it created that lull in between black friday and christmas. so we've talked about planning conservatively for this past year, and we will again for next year, for the fourth quarter. and we think that the opportunity to pick up sales are really the other three quarters. and in particular, the second and third quarter this year. we continue to manage our business. our goal is to maintain or grow gross margins within categories. as you know, it was a very competitive year this year. and what we dropped was mainly reflecting the ongoing impact of 5% rewards and pfresh, combined with a little higher clearance in some of our seasonal categories. but all in all, i think the team did a great job of managing our inventory. we did come out very clean. our inventory headed into the first quarter was exactly where it was last year, on a per store basis. so we feel great about that. the other thing i would add is, you have to take a look at the mix of our business, too. and there was industry softness in electronics and toys, which are really important to us. there was not any must-have, really super-hot new products that really drove consumers into the stores. and as others have reported, the toy business was a little softer than expected. and same was true in electronics, as we were post-peak in terms of the digital cycles and video game business, in particular, were softer. and that's a huge business for us. so just the cyclical nature of some of these businesses, in addition to what kathee said, cause comps to be a little bit softer than we expected. but we are not bashful about being hyper-competitve, and we want to be really super competitive every year as we head into the holiday season. but we also want to have a balanced approach in making sure that it's not all about market share. we want to gain market share, but do so profitably, and trying to find that right mix. and that's the approach we'll continue to take. okay? thanks, bob. we have time for one more question.
41;13;122;1;0.00819672131147541;we're competitive day in and day out. we have always maintained the position that we're going to be competitive in the marketplace. and so it's a position that we've taken. and as we continue to learn more and as more business migrates to the online channels, we're going to continue to sharpen up our online prices in that channel, as well, and be competitive with those competitors that are most meaningful in that channel. so there will be some sharpening up there SEMICOLON but i would tell you, we offer fantastic value, day in and day out. our pricing strategy has not changed. and as we look across the competitive landscape, we're very, very well-positioned.
41;14;70;1;0.014285714285714285;sure. the biggest impact is the impact of share repurchase, as that levers against growing profits, is the short story on that, dan. and we're happy to spend a little bit more time with you, if you'd like, discussing that. but that's the short story. okay. well, thank you very much. that concludes target's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. thank you all for your participation.
42;1;38;0;0.0;the rate impact of the redcard, peter? yes, the combination of that with the store remodel program, very consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters, somewhere between 25 to 30 basis points of impact.
42;2;158;3;0.0189873417721519;yes, i think your view of q4 is right. i think in particular, this q4 will be particularly difficult, given the fifty-third week and the way the calendar shifts this year, you'll recall we're going to lose six business days between thanksgiving and christmas this year, which will make the comp feel much more difficult than it otherwise might. i think over the longer term, we continue to think a 3% comp is about the right place to be. if you look, again, at our company over 15 years or 20 years, if you net out the contribution of new-store annualization, we essentially ran a pretty consistently a 3% comp over time through good times and tougher times. so we think in an economic environment that might just be a little bit better than today, does not have to improve drastically but a little better than today, we think a 3% comp makes sense.
42;3;69;0;0.0;i think you'll continue to see d&a grow throughout this year as we continue to put significant assets into service. and we'll provide a little bit more color, i think, as we get later into the year and have a little bit more clarity about sales margin and the entire p&l, we'll provide a little more clarity about the entire p&l for canada.
42;4;27;0;0.0;actually, sean, i'm not quite clear on your question. units per transaction in the first quarter were up year over year. help me with that again.
42;5;29;0;0.0;no, selling price per unit was down 60 basis points. that was mix related. right. entirely mix. but units were up consistently for some of the reasons you described.
42;6;101;2;0.019801980198019802;both the stores with the matching of competitors' physical ads and the online match has been fairly stable and has not grown materially over the last quarter. so it still represents a very small portion of our transaction. that's because our everyday price and our promotional prices are so strong, there is generally not much of a gap, if any. so we continue to watch our competitive prices on a day-in and day-out basis and move where we have to be competitive in the marketplace. and so we expect over time this not to change all that much.
42;7;206;1;0.0048543689320388345;yes, i think first i'd start with how we think about this longer term. and we think about, from a longer term perspective, sales through all of our channels, regardless of the channel, need to generate a return, and a return on investment that's similar to what we see in our current us store base. what we see today is, honestly, we're learning a lot about that channel and a lot of this depends on how we're going to ultimately settle on the supply chain that our guest wants to interact with us. how much is ship from store, how much is ship to store. that will have a significant impact ultimately on the ebitda margin rates of that particular channel. but i think once again, depending on where those ebitda margin rates land, sales or capital will move around and we feel very confident that we'll get back to a return that makes sense. having said all that, i think as it relates to the rates embedded within that channel, we feel very comfortable that ultimately we'll get back and operate at that 10% ebitda rate that we've set as part of our long-range plan. thank you.
42;8;56;1;0.017857142857142856;you know, we did see better results in areas that had more normal weather, so that would primarily be the west coast and they were toughest in those seasonal categories where we saw weather off the most, and that would be primarily in the midwest. so we did see quite a swing between the different geographies.
42;9;185;4;0.021621621621621623;yes, like we said, the teams did a very good job of responding to the sale shortfall, retiming receipts and making cancellations. we're going to know a heck of a lot more in the next 30 days as we see what happens and how the sales of these categories play out before we have to take mark-downs in the 4th of july. and if we get really good weather and we have good sell-throughs, then we're going to be right back on plan. if things stay damp and cool for an extended period of time there might be some risk. we do not expect to see a significant risk, whatsoever. we're talking about things on the edges right now. matt, the other thing i'd add is it's a little bit hard to see with the inventory on the balance sheet. the inventory per store in the us is essentially flat to last year. all of the inventory build year over year is attributable to canada. so we feel really good about where the inventory positions are in aggregate.
42;10;144;1;0.006944444444444444;yes, you're right, first of all, that the vast majority of that is multi-channel technology and we've said a little bit of missed timing here. we expect to offset that on the year with expense savings and improvements we're making in our business, but the investment coming a little bit ahead of that. to your second point, i think that's absolutely right. it's interesting. we said this last year, when our sales accelerate or decelerate rapidly from our expectations, we tend to see our sg&a lag both directions. it does not climb as fast when sales go up like last year, and does not come down quite as quickly when we see sales decelerate. as we adapt to wherever sales are going to be, you'll see our sg&a settle in at a more appropriate level.
42;11;102;2;0.0196078431372549;yes, i would say out of the blocks, 38% was a little higher than we expected because the mix was a little bit better than we expected out of the blocks. whether it's in canada or the us, clearly when we open a new store we get a higher gross margin rate, but the mix was even higher than the higher that we expected. so we do expect that to settle down and be slightly higher than what it is in the us, because we expect the mix to be a little bit better than it is here in the us.
42;12;286;6;0.02097902097902098;i would not call it hoopla. i would just say that the guests were very, very excited and we experienced tremendous surges in sales. and it's just very, very early to draw any conclusions. and we really wanted to deliver a great experience and so to a certain extent we went in with staffing levels to make sure that we were taking care of the guest, both at the front end and we had the right team members there for the supply chain and we had the right teams on the sales floor. so we know that over time and in a run state in addition, we have to work hard at making sure that we get our productivity levels where the business models dictates them to be. and we know our gross margins will settle in and we've got to become more productive and run the business. over time our consumables share will grow. that's the hardest trip to change with the guest and so we're going to continue to focus on those frequency-oriented categories so that we can not only get the good mix that we're getting, but we want to now start driving more trip frequency into the store. we did not want to come out of the blocks by hitting those categories too hard because we wanted to make sure that we led with our strength. and we wanted to make sure that all the supply chains and the operational disciplines were in place. we feel very confident now that they are. we're ready to start making those kinds of adjustments in merchandising and supply chain and in store operations to start refining the model.
42;13;7;0;0.0;i use that sometimes here, too. (laughter)
42;14;39;0;0.0;i think the one thing i'd remind you is, we only had a half a quarter's worth of profit sharing with td. next quarter we'll have a full quarter's worth of profit sharing with td.
42;15;12;0;0.0;no, no, no. that's net of our operating expenses as well.
42;16;12;0;0.0;we can take it offline and walk through that in detail, colin.
42;17;90;1;0.011111111111111112;yes, no question. what we're seeing, i think we talked about this a little bit three or four or five weeks ago when we were together. you'll see the ramp-up in our expense initiatives throughout the year and through next year, actually. many of them are a little bit longer lead times to pull out expense, all the easy stuff we've done long, long time ago. so we do expect through time, sg&a will come down and manage to a level that is more appropriate.
42;18;269;4;0.01486988847583643;i'll take the first part. i think the traffic -- this was a disappointing quarter for us. we had very, very strong traffic last year. there was pluses and minuses throughout 2012 and we expect traffic trends to get stronger as the year goes on. and we have all of our initiatives designed to, not only deepen the relationship, but build frequency. so we'll perhaps be a little bit more aggressive on price. you have to look at the competitive environment, it was a little bit more aggressive than it had been in the past where there was more emphasis on price, and that, i think, impacted it a little bit. overall, we really expect to be able to generate traffic levels that are flattish, give or take, over normalized periods of time. bob, the other thing i'd add, i do not think we need to run traffic numbers like we did last year in first quarter to generate that 3% comp. i think if you look over the past several years, about 0.5 points of traffic combined with ticket gets us to a 3% comp. that's about the formula that we feel really good about. the only other thing that i would add is, this time of year our seasonal categories can be a big traffic driver for target, and clearly they were not in the quarter and they were last year. so all of the things you mentioned, 5%, pfresh, help us all year long but during key seasonal categories, key seasonal time frames, we need those categories to drive traffic as well.
42;19;232;6;0.02586206896551724;our conversion has been improving over the past year, deb, and we were up slightly in this quarter as well. so we're really pleased with the improvements that we've made on this site but i'll tell you, we still feel we have a long way to go with conversion. and we are very committed to continuing to work on our navigation and our search function and the basic functionality of our site to continue to make big improvements there. i think the other thing i'd add, deb, is we have a little bit of a mix headwind which is positive from our perspective. mobile, in general has a much lower conversion rate than the site, and our mobile is growing much, much faster than the site. we think that's good because we think that's where things are going and it also shows that she is spending a lot of time with us on the mobile applications we have. but conversion's just naturally lower there, and so creates a little bit of a mix number as we look at the aggregate. if you look at conversion on our site, it's up to last year. if you look at conversion on mobile, it's up to last year. but because of the big growth in mobile, to john's point, conversion comes down slightly in aggregate.
42;20;66;0;0.0;i think we've said a couple times the affordable care act, the changes for us will be relatively -- well, they will not be relatively -- they will not be material externally. we're still continuing to work through all the regulations and what we will exactly do, but it will not be material changes to what we're doing today, or financially from a financial perspective.
42;21;91;6;0.06593406593406594;we feel good about where we are. we've been working on this for a long time and we continue to deploy resources to get better and better at that. so this is just a long-term initiative that we have to continue to focus on, whether it's in food, whether it's demographics, whether it is ethnic groups, we've just got to continue to get better at our localization efforts. we think we've made good progress there and we are going to continue to focus on it.
42;22;120;0;0.0;i would just say, deb, i think it's a little early to learn from canada and bring that back to the us. i will tell you, though, we learned a lot from the city targets that we applied to canada. as you know, those stores are in dense urban areas and so are our canada stores. we took a lot of that learning and the testing that we did last year and applied that to what we're doing in canada. throughout this year of course, we'll be reading the canada results and bringing that back to the us. but the same teams work on localization for both countries. thank you. we have time for one more question.
42;23;166;10;0.060240963855421686;when we look at the stack comps, we feel a lot better about it, since you're just looking at this quarter, both were positive if we look on a stacked basis. going forward, our compare in second quarter is not nearly as difficult as our first quarter, so we would expect our comps to improve and over time we want that two-year stack to improve. we're not happy with flat or up slightly. we want to make sure that we're making progress there. it was, on a two-year basis, better. i think i'd just add a little color to that. apparel, for instance, the two-year stack is around a 2%. running that consistently through time, we'd feel really good about running 2%s in apparel. as kathee said, home is positive. that's a big improvement from where home has been over the past several years. on a two-year basis we feel good about both those businesses.
42;24;162;0;0.0;yes, you know, that's difficult to parce out. the example i would give you is exactly what gregg said, where we started with the stores staffed very heavily. we know through time we have to refine that model, is that one-time expense or operating expense. certainly the expenses related to hiring team members early and training them at the next cycle of stores we'll open up, that is all one-time and will drift away. what i'd tell you is, through time we expect ultimately well down the road to get to sg&a rates that make sense and productivities that are very similar to the us. so as i said before, as we get a little bit more clarity, right now expense dominates the p&l in canada. and was we get more clarity on sales, margin, operations later in the year, we'll provide a lot more color about how we expect those stores to operate.
42;25;132;3;0.022727272727272728;this is something that we are always looking at and adjusting. but, i guess i would tell you i do not feel like we've gone too far. our inventory as john mentioned, our average inventory per store is flat to last year. it's actually up a bit in apparel given the softer sales in the first quarter. so we're always looking at that. we look as much at out-of-stocks as we do in-stocks, in trying to improve those stores. it's a constant focus for us and we can always improve, but i feel pretty good about where we are right now in terms of in-stock. okay. thank you. that concludes target's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. thank you all for your participation.
43;1;119;4;0.03361344537815126;i think on the sequentially, yes it improved month to month within the quarter. none of the quarters were negative, which compared to first quarter was significant progress. july was notably the strongest, but a portion of that certainly was attributable to that back-to-school week moving in from august last year. so we did see it strengthening, but i would not want to overplay that, certainly a portion of it is attributable to the calendar. geography wise, we have not seen anything meaningfully different in aggregate across the quarter. in any one week or day there's differences, depending on when back-to-school starts in various portions of the country, but nothing meaningful across the country.
43;2;276;5;0.018115942028985508;well i would say, this is gregg, in the us, we continue to offer hot pricing. there is not going to be a meaningful change in our strategy, because day in and day out we have unbeatable prices when you take a look at our -- the fact that our prices are competitive, the price match policy both online and in store, and our redcards performance day in and day out. we have a very strong value proposition. and then our circular pricing is even more aggressive than that, and we take market leading positions. in canada, we know that we have an opportunity to break those shopping habits and we've got to focus on driving need-based trips. so, there in particular we will sharpen up our pricing, and make sure that we are taking a more of a market leader position. our redcard penetration is still very, very small there, and we expect that to grow over time. but it's more in canada that we're going to make sure that our prices get more noticed than they have been up to this point. part of that was a conscience plan on our part to make sure that we really won in home and apparel, and we feel real good about where we are in those two businesses today, so we're proud of that fact. now we have to just turn on the gas a little bit on the other side of the equation to make sure that we're getting the canadian guests to understand what great values we offer on frequency categories and break some of those well-established habits.
43;3;33;1;0.030303030303030304;so, i'm not entirely clear where you're going. is it that why are we confident about the $0.80, or what will we see happen here as we go forward, sean?
43;4;245;6;0.024489795918367346;so on 2014, i think it's very early here, and we've given you our best view. i think when you step back we've been operating 60 some stores for on average about 2.5 months, and so we're giving you our best information here for 2013. and clearly sales are a little bit short of where we need to work through some of the inventory and optimizing the business and optimizing our expense structure. i think as we look forward getting another 56 stores open, getting through a holiday will certainly provide a lot more information about where we expect to be. but in 2014, i think we expect to see meaningful improvement in the profitability of canada. we'll cycle past all of the start up expenses, we'll have our inventories more in line with sales patterns that we now have some information on. our expense structure will be optimized to the sales level and we'll start to grow sales. so i think we'll see meaningful improvement in 2014, but i would say probably from this perspective today, unlikely that we'll see profitability on the full year. and we'll be back to provide a little bit more information on what that looks like, and the cadence throughout the quarters, again, as we get a little bit more information this year, get the stores open, get new markets and get through a holiday season most importantly.
43;5;298;4;0.013422818791946308;yes, i think parsing that all out is difficult. i would say that the second one, incremental marketing and advertising is not material to the total move from where we were to where we are today. i think the biggest driver of the change in profitability or dilution this year comes from, we had a set of sales expectations as we entered in the market, and we also, given all of the excitement that we saw building over two years, we protected on the upside from an expense standpoint and from an inventory standpoint, and the sales have been somewhat disappointing. and so we need to work through those inventories. there's some clearance activity, there was some excess inventory this quarter, as well, that we work through. and we need to right size the entire expense structure for what -- for the sales numbers that are currently -- that we're operating at. so, i think that's the vast majority of it. i do not think we see, i know we do not see going forward a change in the overall our view of what the margin rates were going to be, ebitda or ebit rates were going to be in canada over the long term. we feel very good about gross margin, and frankly, we expect gross margin will deteriorate a little bit as we begin to drive these frequency categories. you do not see that in this quarters' results, because there was a fair bit of clearance and excess inventory that we moved through, but we expect margin rates will come down as we grow sales in those frequency categories. but net, net that'll be good for the business and start to apply leverage against the fixed expenses that we've built for the business.
43;6;301;6;0.019933554817275746;you're right, greg. traffic was our issue, and i do think that somewhat that is the way it is right now. we're seeing a lot of trip consolidation across all guests. i think the part that i'm pleased about is that when you look at our basket, we are seeing that they're buying more units from target, as well as increased selling price, and they are trading up into higher price point product, so that's great. i think as we move forward the thing that we're focused on and driving traffic is really making sure that as they're consolidating and they're doing more in one store, that we're offering that compelling value. and gregg talked a lot about all of those components, but that we make sure that that continues to be rock solid. as well as the innovative product, and i mentioned a lot of those that we have coming like phillip and haggar and in our seasonal categories we've got a lot of new stuff coming, so that's key. and then, i guess, the third thing that i would add is just making sure that our in-store experience remains outstanding. because we want them to be pleased when they come, and continue to consolidate their trip and to do more at target. so we have great service every day, but in addition to that, some of the new things that we're doing with flexible fulfillment, like buy online, pick up in store, i think will be fantastic in the back half. and then we're also looking at really upping the in-store experience in key categories like beauty and the test that i described in baby. so it's a combination of those three things.
43;7;186;2;0.010752688172043012;the inventory overhang is a function of the shortfall primarily in some of the seasonal categories. so, think of -- even though apparel and home was strong, the variability by store, and the fact that some of our seasonal categories, like lawn and patio did not perform at the level that we were expecting. so, it was not in the basic categories or the non-discretionaries, primarily in a subset of the discretionary categories. but it's one of those things where it's more obvious, because it's such a large number of stores. but it's the same kind of fine tuning that we go through every time we open a new store here in the united states, and they have experienced for years and years. there is always a tremendous amount of fine tuning and getting the right match of sales volatility, variability, assortment, and aligning that with inventory. what we're seeing in canada is there's such a big critical mass that it stands out, and it's far more obvious. but it's no different than what we've experienced here.
43;8;108;3;0.027777777777777776;yes, i think that we're seeing larger basket in many different areas they're shopping, as i said doing more in one store so shopping around the store. in terms of the selling price, we're seeing strength in trading up to higher price points in back-to-school. we're seeing strength, for example, in home with threshold, where they're buying that better product versus opening price point product. and then we're also seeing some softer sales in our one spot at the front of the store, which is very seasonal and impulsive product, so that combination i think is driving that selling price.
43;9;224;3;0.013392857142857142;well we do not have a number that we can share on that. we have, as you know, been testing it with team members, and i think the key for us is just the convenience for guests to be able to buy it online. but then they want to pick it up in store. sometimes they do not want it delivered and sitting on their doorstep, but oftentimes they want to be able to get other things in the store either that go along with that core item or just the rest of their list. so, we think it will be very interesting to our guests. it certainly has been with our team members, but we have not quantified the sales number yet. yes, i would just say this is -- we're in a learning environment right now. we'll be able to give you a lot more specifics after we get through the holiday season. and for us to try and quantify at this stage would be, it would be a shot in the dark. so we really do not want to speculate how our guests are going to use that and -- but we'll be back to you at the end of the holiday and we'll give you a lot more color around the adoption, the acceptance rates by our guest.
43;10;134;1;0.007462686567164179;there is not really a meaningful difference in terms of the rate of spend first half, second half. we did not overspend or under spend in the first half to shift dollars to the second half. we've always felt that the allocation of resources by quarter, by half has been pretty appropriate, and our spend is going to be similar in those kinds of percentages. what we have seen is, we've ramped up our spend in the digital channel. it's a less expensive channel that gives us different guests and broader reach, and we become far more efficient in the use of our marketing dollars. so, i think we're getting the same or more bang for our buck for essentially the same investments that we've made in the past.
43;11;45;2;0.044444444444444446;yes, we're excited to have metro as partner to run our pharmacies in the quebecian province in the eastern part of canada. we think they are a great partner. they run a terrific business, and we're thrilled to have them as our partner.
43;12;110;1;0.00909090909090909;we're doing a lot with both e-mail and text. but i would tell you, deb that we're in the beginning of that journey. we think there's a lot more that we can do, but we're doing things with personalization in terms of seasonal and timing, but also product categories that resonate with our guests and we're seeing great results. we've upped particularly e-mail a lot this year, and it's really paying off. and so we're on a journey, and we think that there's a lot of head room there, and we will go after that in a big way.
43;13;338;1;0.0029585798816568047;i do not think that we'll be adding a lot of planogram versions. i think we're still tweaking what's on those planograms. but we've -- we understand that, and we've got many different versions throughout canada for all of their differences across geography and their guests. but i think what gregg was talking about was, number one, getting the buy right by store in all of those categories, and then some of the seasonal categories were softer. so making sure that we get that buy right going forward, that has less to do with the planogram itself. and then in addition to that, as we're driving more trips with our frequency categories, that's the side that's been weaker, we think that traffic will also help sales throughout the store, because the guests clearly likes our differentiated merchandise on the apparel and home side. so it's a combination, but it's more about the buy than it is about planograms. the other thing i'd add, jason, if you step back to where we were three months ago the gross margin rate was a little bit above 38%. and the two things we said at that time, i think, are still appropriate. one, it's going to be noisy here early by quarter because it's just naturally that way as we're opening up stores. but two, do not expect us to operate at that high a level. while the mix was very favorable, we hadn't gone through any seasonal clearance. and so seasonal clearance is going to naturally bring that rate down. this quarter a little bit more than we would have expected, but there again i said we're working through some excess inventory given our sales levels. so we expect through time that the gross margin rate will normalize at a reasonable level that ultimately will allow us to deliver ebitda margin rates let's say 12% in canada like we've talked about all along.
43;14;181;3;0.016574585635359115;i would think of it as this way. in our business in any point in time there are investments that we have to make to continue to get better at what we do, whether it's a service or supply chain or technology investment or investments in the guest experience. and so this is -- we're calling attention to this. but these are investments that we're going to make in the business because we want to provide a great experience, which means our expense optimization efforts, as they have in the past, have to more than offset these kinds of investments. so, we look at it all-in holistically and we're saying hey we got to get leaner and meaner in certain parts of the organization, and become more efficient, and we demonstrated that last quarter. we were very, very rock solid in our expense and our productivity and that affords us the ability to -- and the capacity to get more aggressive and do some of these kinds of things, and invest in transforming the business to the future.
43;15;171;3;0.017543859649122806;jason, we said at the beginning of the year the investments in multi-channel and everything we were doing would be $0.20 to $0.25 of incremental dilution or incremental expense in our business. and we said at that time that through our expense optimization efforts we expected to offset virtually all of that in the year. we do that in a variety of ways. the stores have continuously over a long period of years looked for ways to increase productivity faster than wage rate and faster than sales, so lowering our expense rate. and we think there's opportunities to continue to apply technology to improve productivity in our stores. but what gregg was talking about, our expense optimization efforts are across the entire organization, headquarters, distribution, supply chain. everywhere we operate, we are looking for ways to take expense out so that we can afford to invest in the business. great. well that concludes target's second-quarter 2013 earnings conference call. thank you all for your participation.
44;1;280;4;0.014285714285714285;i will start, greg. i think a couple things. one, i think first of all, the stress on low-income consumers is certainly playing a role. we've seen all year long. the payroll tax increase has been a portion of that, for sure. i think we get to cycle past that in january, and we will get better information about what that looks like going forward. but beyond that, and the things that we actually control, as you said, we continue to see meaningful growth in redcard. that continues to drive 50% lifts in sales, all of that driven by traffic. kansas city is above 25% penetration now. so it continues to grow hundreds of basis points a year. then beyond that, i think it's all about our multi-channel initiatives, and everything we are doing there. and as i said, we are starting to see strong digital sales growth. that, combined with the flex fulfillment activities that we are implementing now, piloting a little later this year, and we'll begin to roll out next year -- we think all of that put together will continue to drive meaningful traffic increases. the only thing that i would add, greg -- this is kathee -- is just that, as guests are consolidating their trips and they're coming less frequently, it's really important for us to get them to shop around the store and to buy more. and you do see in our basket that we have been able to accomplish that for the past several quarters as well. so we will stay focused on how do we ensure that we get more of their wallet when they do come.
44;2;120;1;0.008333333333333333;yes, they do. they get total credit for anything that is bought online, picked up in-store, or things that are in store where there is an extended aisle sale. so we are incenting this. actually, we have a parallel environment where both teams -- both our dot-com team and our store teams -- get credit for growing the business in a collaborative way. there is no penalties, or there is no internal conflict at all as it relates to who is going to get that credit for the sale. we are double crediting everybody from an internal standpoint, and then we take it out at the enterprise level to make sure that it all washes through on a consolidated basis.
44;3;11;0;0.0;if it's shipped to your home from the store, yes.
44;4;108;2;0.018518518518518517;most of what is driving it up for the fourth quarter will be those hot categories like electronics that are most popular in the holiday season. and there is a lot of newness there that drive up the average selling price. think of ipads SEMICOLON think of all the new video game consoles and games, which target does very well with. and we are really excited about that business for the holiday season. i would anticipate it will continue into the fourth quarter. think of it more as a change in the mix of what we are selling at this time of year versus trading up within category.
44;5;158;3;0.0189873417721519;first, i would tell you it is pretty early. i think we've got about six months in with cartwheel SEMICOLON but as we mentioned, very excited. we've got over 3 million users right now that are very engaged. i think it is helping trips. i also think it's really helping basket, because they are using cartwheel in the store on their mobile device, looking for deals on things that they want to buy and they are adding more to their basket. it is still really early to see trends, but we are very excited about it, and are talking about it more and more. we are going to be using cartwheel as one of our vehicles to help drive value this holiday season. and hopefully more and more people will hear about it and sign up for it. but we think this is a big success story for us that we can continue to grow.
44;6;470;11;0.023404255319148935;there is always hope, sean. we are highly confident (laughter) it is going to be successful. your inventory question -- we talked a lot last time about, given the sales shortfall and the fact that we planned inventories to protect on the upside SEMICOLON given all the excitement, there's a pretty large inventory overhang. as the teams have worked hard over the past 90 days assessing the best way to handle that -- and it depends on the various categories about the best way to handle that -- we have clearly seen some markdowns come through. we're taking advantage of that, actually, to drive value messaging in canada and get across how sharp our prices are. and then we are also assessing what of the inventory do we think we're going to sell ultimately below cost or end up salvaging because there's just flat out too much of it. and that is the inventory reserves that we assess at the end of the third quarter. we do that every quarter anyway as a matter of course, and we will do that again at the end of the fourth quarter. but that was a large piece of what happened at the end of the third quarter. i think as far as lumpiness of inventories -- as you would expect it's the long-lead categories where we tend to be lumpy. the stuff that turns quicker or that is domestically sourced we can obviously shut down receipts much quicker. but stuff that is long-lead -- and we will see this continue actually a little bit into spring -- and here think about categories like bikes, where those are a long-lead items, and it just -- we can not get out of the receipts once we have made commitments. those are the type of items that will take us a little bit longer to clear through. i think on signs of hope -- we would not call it hope -- but on signs of our execution starting to improve, we are seeing -- and i think this is consistent with what gregg said -- as we start to get sales histories, we can start to replenish stores more accurately, balance our inventories, and meet guest need when they need that. we are starting to see success there. as we look at our current results, we're pretty much hitting our current forecast, but we are seeing much stronger results in the cycles that have been open longer. cycle one, cycle two, cycle three have actually begun to exceed our expectations a bit. we're a little bit hopeful -- not hopeful SEMICOLON we are optimistic that we are seeing the right trend with those cycles improving. and we believe we will continue to see that as we get more age behind the cycle four and cycle five stores.
44;7;150;1;0.006666666666666667;i think our efforts on expense optimization continue to be very successful. the teams are very engaged across the company and continuing to look for new ideas of ways that we can reduce expense. and i think part of this is about lowering our center of gravity that you are referring to. but a big part of it, too, is reinvesting that in other parts of the business. you have really seen that this year. we had significant incremental investments in technology, supply chain. that will happen again next year, particularly around technology and flexible fulfillment. we will make sg&a investments, and expense optimization really allows us to offset that. i think leverage probably has not changed a whole lot -- somewhere between that 1% and 2% range -- but it gives us a lot of capacity to invest in the business as we continue to grow our multi-channel capabilities.
44;8;70;0;0.0;we agree with the last part of that comment, and we have continued to say it's very early here, and we are going to see it move around again in the fourth quarter, given we see the surge in holiday sales. i do not have the exact weighted average on the store timing, matt, but john hulbert will get that to you -- we can get that to you today.
44;9;104;6;0.057692307692307696;matt, i would say it's strong overall. certainly that varies by category, but there are a lot of great trends in our business in electronics. i mentioned a couple that we are excited about for black friday and going into cyber monday and the rest of the holiday season. things like beats by dr. dre -- the whole headphone category had been fantastic, and that's a lead item. speaker systems like sonos have been fantastic. so there are many different categories that are performing well. some are little bit softer, like cameras, but in total, a really strong business in electronics right now.
44;10;338;5;0.014792899408284023;hi chris, this is gregg. over the long term our expectations have not changed at all. what we're experiencing now, and as john talked about it, it is those long lead time businesses that are mark-down sensitive, particularly home and apparel, that we have to exit and it is costly to do so. remember, the first cycle stores did not open until april, and the second cycle followed shortly after that. and that was only a handful number of stores. by the time we really got a good clear indication in terms of where the sales were going to level out for this year, in our long-cycle businesses -- and think six, seven, eight months -- these receipts were already planned and in production and on the way. it's really the lump of inventory that we've got to work through, and once we do that, we are very confident that we are going to be back in the mid-30%s like we talked about in terms of the overall gross margin, because the mix continues to be strong, and we are very pleased with that. we do not see any signs of that abating. it might come down a little bit as we get more aggressive in terms of building that trip frequency. and we will start those efforts in earnest when we turn the corner in 2014. but on an absolute basis, we are really pleased with where we are in home and apparel, and we've got to get through this next quarter and the early part of the beginnings of 2014 until we really get that sales history developed by item, by store and eliminate some of the huge variability that we have in the supply chain so that we can get a more even balance between receipt flow and what we are selling. and at that point in time, we fully believe that we are going to be back to where our initial expectations were from a gross margin standpoint.
44;11;178;5;0.028089887640449437;these are against the new, most recent level-setting expectations that we shared that at the analyst day that said they are not where they were when we originally planned the business, but now that we have had enough experience, we see where they were and we established and rebooted, essentially, our expectations for canada. so against that new, most current forecast, what we are seeing is encouraging signs out of those earlier-cycle stores. they are exceeding these newer, revised forecasts more than the later-cycle stores because they have had a chance to operate on their own. they are six months into it now. the inventories are flowing better SEMICOLON in-stock levels have improved SEMICOLON the guest is getting used to our stores SEMICOLON they are converting from more of a browser to a shopper. it is still very early, but we like what we see in some of those early-cycle stores. and so at this stage we are just encouraged by the fact that they're performing better against most revised, revised forecast.
44;12;53;0;0.0;i do not know that number off the top of my head. it is definitely higher than our typical market share, but we can get back to you with that number. yes, it's much higher than our aggregate store or electronics market shares. we will get back to you on that one.
44;13;168;2;0.011904761904761904;that's a lot of questions. on the third quarter, i think clearly halloween moving into the quarter benefited. i would remind you that we also said at the end of last quarter, our back-to-school week moved out of the quarter into second quarter. that benefited second quarter. net/net, probably a wash, maybe 10 plus/minus --10, 20 basis points, i do not really know -- but net/net a wash. wic -- any time there is a decrease like that, there is an impact. but for us, grocery, food is about 20% of our business roughly SEMICOLON and it's a very different kind of trip for us than most grocers. so certainly there is an impact. but for us, meaningfully, that is just not -- again, this is a small impact relative to what we might see at other retailers who sell significantly more food as a percentage of their business than we do. and then electronics -- what was the question in electronics? i'm sorry.
44;14;208;4;0.019230769230769232;we do not necessarily talk about categories and how big they are. but with two new console releases and all the games that will go with them -- as you know it has been a declining category for several years, given the maturity. it's been over seven years since we had a new console. so having two in the same year is very meaningful for the category. it is also very meaningful for electronics in the store. so we think its going to be one of the biggest gifts gifting categories of the year, and we will certainly benefit from that. and then on fuel, there is no question that in a time when, particularly lower income consumers have very constrained budgets, having to spend less on fuel, it helps in some way. for us, i will tell you, through time we have looked at this many ways and it's really hard to quantify fuel price moves in our sales. there are times when fuel prices are going up in a good economy, and that is good for everybody, which is different than today. it's hard to quantify, but overall, lower fuel prices is definitely good for consumers. it just puts more money in their pocket.
44;15;169;9;0.05325443786982249;apparel, i think, was -- most of what we have is own brand product and exclusive designer partnerships that we do. so that is the bulk of our business. certainly we do a lot of basics with branded manufacturers -- haynes for example. but our comp in apparel was down slightly. it was much stronger online. so we are seeing some shifting happening there. we are pleased with the new releases that we have had. phillip lim was probably our best designer launch ever -- very clean sell-throughs, both in stores and online. our launch of our holiday product is off to a good start, while it is still early. we're feeling pretty good about apparel overall. i would say that the softest part of apparel has been in kids. and we are working on ways to make sure that we can drive that business and have the right price/value relationship for our guests to help drive better market share gains. but the rest i feel pretty confident in.
44;16;172;0;0.0;the 50 basis points is about right. and i would say about half of that was due to the ongoing pressure we have seen for several years now related to redcard and the store remodel program. the other half, like we talked a little bit about, was really related to markdowns we took, given the halloween sell-through that we saw. and we saw sales soften up, like we said, in the middle of the quarter, given everything that was going on with consumer confidence and in washington. we saw sales soften up a bit, and really just some promotional markdowns to sell through our halloween inventory. i think as we think about fourth quarter, as we talked about, it's going to be very promotional SEMICOLON there's no doubt about that. but the primary driver of our performance versus last year is, last year we took significant clearance markdowns last year, and that's what you'll see be the primary variance year over year in our gross margin rate.
44;17;2;0;0.0;yes. absolutely.
44;18;161;5;0.031055900621118012;we have not disclosed the drag from start-up expenses all year long. so we have not really talked about that a whole lot. as it relates to price investment and markdowns, i think it is all -- we view that as all one big bucket, really SEMICOLON and it's really the total value message we are able to give to the guests in canada right now. as i said, we have a little bit of excess inventory. we will take advantage of that. to be sure, we are giving a great value message. but beyond that, as we look at our pricing in canada on like items, we are right on where we want to be. we are locally competitive and right on the price leaders in canada. so we feel really good about our pricing in canada on like-for-like items. great. that concludes target's third-quarter 2013 earnings conference call. thank you all for your participation.
45;1;53;0;0.0;sean, i think a lot of the things that i talked about today with product as well as with in-store experience and our mobile experience, those are really the key things for us to help drive people to shop at target beyond the food you talked about and, of course, the redcard.
45;2;63;1;0.015873015873015872;yes, in stocks have been rock solid for quite some time, and in terms of product, i would tell you that we're always making adjustments to what we carry in stores. we learn what's selling and what trends are picking up steam, things like organics and better for you products, so that's a never-ending thing that we work on.
45;3;63;1;0.015873015873015872;we are expanding the assortment right now. i do not have a date for you in terms of when we will get our whole assortment up online, and right now we're focusing on the most popular items and categories, so we recently added pets for example. and we will just continue to expand as we learn more and more about that program.
45;4;230;6;0.02608695652173913;sure, inventory up about 10% year-over-year, and you could roughly think about that split about equally between canada and the us. canada obviously, we're just in a different place than we were a year ago. we built inventories all year as we opened stores. i would tell you in canada we feel much, much better. we feel very good about the progress we made in the fourth quarter clearing excess inventory. the average inventory per store in canada from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter went down about 30%, so we still have some lingering issues in q1 with some long receipts but feel very good about the inventory there. in the us, i would tell you the merchant team did an outstanding job reacting to the change in sales, and our inventories are in excellent shape. this is the time of year where in february, we are changing lots of things in the store, and frankly depending on where you snap the line for year-end relative to our receipts, we see inventory move around a little bit. if you go back over the past couple of years, our inventory per store in the us is up about 3% versus two years ago, so this is really more timing than anything else, and we feel very good about the inventory position.
45;5;153;1;0.006535947712418301;well, we should go offline and review where you are, where you think we are versus our credit rating and where we think we are versus our credit rating. we've actually run pretty close to our credit rating not just last year, which was even higher, but for the past several years. so our view is that we think we can do -- given our plans between $1 billion and $2 billion. we need to see our business results improve over the next couple of quarters. we're starting to see that in february as we eluded to, and then also gave little bit of a view into what the potential costs are that may be coming our way as a result of the breach. but given all of that, we still think somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion beginning in the back half of the year for the year makes sense.
45;6;34;0;0.0;as we said, it's not estimable at this time. what the potential cost of the breach is and given where we are in the process, it'd be inappropriate for me to speculate.
45;7;79;0;0.0;just to be clear, that was insurance receivable, so we have not actually received payment, but we feel pretty -- we feel very likely to receive payment for a portion of the expenses we incurred in the fourth quarter. what we can say about insurance right now is at this point we think there's $44 million of insurance that we will receive, and to the extent that number changes, we will be back to you to provide more information.
45;8;133;4;0.03007518796992481;yes, in traffic your view of what happened post the breach is pretty accurate, and we have seen traffic continue to improve and firm up, and definitely throughout february we've seen traffic firm up. and as we said, sales have improved, and a big part of that has been traffic. on the redcard, what we've seen is -- and kathee talked about this a little bit. in our core guests, redcard guests, they've continued to shop with us. and we've seen very strong, very strong sales from that. redcard penetration continues to grow meaningfully, hundreds of basis points year-over-year, and to the extent we're not growing where we used to, that's driven by new accounts, so the guests who have redcards continue to shop our stores.
45;9;19;0;0.0;as has been the case over the past couple the of years, the penetration growth comes from new accounts.
45;10;83;1;0.012048192771084338;great question, matt, and it's -- analyzing weather is not a perfect science. i would tell you when we see in the midwest and the northeast, when we've seen these weather patterns go across the country, the spread is significant between the two, but ultimately as that passes, we see them restabilize and everything come back to normal. but the difference while it is going on is pretty dramatic. it's in single digits difference, but it would be high single digits.
45;11;171;4;0.023391812865497075;we're always working on inventory accuracy, and that is a combination of how we use our systems as well as the processes in store. and so it's been less of an issue to date as we get into some of the additional categories, things like beauty where there's a lot of skus -- excuse me, we've got to make sure that the accuracy is there. i will tell you apparel, while we've had good results there, it's a little bit harder. partly accuracy, but partly being able to find the exact size when it's not in a [planagrammed] environment, so there are a few challenges for us to figure out, but overall i would tell you that our guest response has been very positive in the survey comments that they have back to us, they really love the service. so, yes, we will keep working on accuracy to make sure we can fulfill as many orders as possible, but so far we're very pleased.
45;12;138;3;0.021739130434782608;first, the comparison to last year we have to be a little bit careful. there's a 53rd week in there. that's a relatively low volume week which creates a little bit of distortion year-over-year. but i think as i said, we continue to work very hard on store productivity ensuring that we're driving great guest experience and in stocks, but also improving our productivity, and then all of the expense optimization efforts continue to go on, and some portion of that will fall to the bottom line. some portion of that goes to gross margin, and some portion of that gets reinvested in the business as we invest in multi channel technologies supply chain. but i think flat to up slightly is probably about the best way to think about it. thank you.
45;13;36;1;0.027777777777777776;we did not give a number, but i will tell you it was very positive above the industry and slightly above 20%. like the rest of the business, it was impacted by the breach as well.
45;14;139;4;0.02877697841726619;it's -- from our perspective, we've got to up our game on all fronts. it starts with delivering great content, great in stocks. our team is more engaged than ever from a service standpoint both on the sales floor and at the lanes, and we're going to deliver as kathee said just some eye popping, irresistible deals. so we're going to really up the ante as it makes a statement on our unbeatable pricing proposition which we have. we've price matched the competition, and we run our circulars, and with our 5% redcards rewards program, our value proposition is unbeatable. we're just going to call greater attention to that, and selectively we're going to go out and be more aggressive in that regard, so it's the combination of all of those elements.
45;15;201;5;0.024875621890547265;sure, mix in canada continues to be stronger in apparel and home, and we expect that to moderate through time. we ultimately think the mix there will be stronger than what we see in the us, but a lot like our high volume stores in the us, our urban stores in the us, we see a higher mix of home and apparel sales. that will moderate through time because we want to drive the frequency categories. that's what we're working on the team in canada. ultimately as they're successful in driving conversion, commodities, groceries, food, all those categories, we will see that mix moderate. i think we'll see margin, we expect to see some volatility. q1 for instance, the margin rate will not be at 30%, but it will be significantly improved from the 4.4% we recorded in the fourth quarter. so we will make progress, and you should expect to see that throughout the year, and of course back in fourth quarter next year we will be down a little bit from that 30% as is typical in our us business given that time of year. okay. we have time for one more question, please.
45;16;38;0;0.0;chris, we do not break out promotions individually. it was a big time of year, and the number was relatively large, but in the big scheme of the fourth quarter, i would tell you it's not material.
45;17;159;1;0.006289308176100629;there's $200 million that we recorded in 2014, we will annualize on that. or 2013, excuse me. we'll annualize on that next year, and the savings came from all over the corporation. there were savings in gross margin around transportation expenses. that will grow again in 2014. there were savings -- really it's hard to pin it down. it was literally across the entire organization where we looked at things. we looked at how we sourced product and aligning our non-retail product that we sourced and services and making that look more like we do in merchandising, and we saw significant savings there from our sourcing. there's more to do there, and we will see that grow in 2014 as well. as gregg said, it was literally across the entire organization where we were focused on stopping things that we did not need to do, and if we did need to do them, improving productivity.
45;18;84;2;0.023809523809523808;the chip technology makes it such that using the account numbers without the card becomes very much more difficult, and so the desire to obtain those card numbers goes down significantly. what we've seen in other countries that have adopted chip technology is fraud rates go down dramatically for in-store transactions, and i think in the uk or europe, i can not remember exactly, down like 60% once chip technology was enabled. so the desire for those account numbers becomes less desirable.
45;19;65;0;0.0;chris, we're in the middle of an investigation, and we can not talk about the specifics. we continue to learn. there will be learnings that come out of that investigation, and from those learnings, we will take action, and that's about what we can say today. okay. well, that concludes targets fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. thank you all for your participation.
46;1;95;3;0.031578947368421054;matt, all i can tell you is what we're focused on going forward, and kathee and i and the whole leadership team have been talking to the team for the past couple of weeks about our focus on driving the business forward. and we have three key objectives: drive sales and traffic in the us SEMICOLON accelerate our operational improvement in canada, and ultimately our business performance SEMICOLON and then third, accelerate our transformation and get to be a leading omnichannel retailer in the us. and that's where we have the teams focused.
46;2;246;2;0.008130081300813009;matt, as you know, when sales get out of -- when sales are not on expectation, and inventories get a little heavy, they get lumpy. so, there's areas where we're a little bit heavier than we would like SEMICOLON there's areas where we are a little bit lighter than we would like. and we're working to, i'd say, balance all of the inventories. and a lot of it, frankly, will be dependent on: do we meet our sales objectives? in the first quarter, a little bit light, but not materially so. and if we continue to hit our sales objectives, i think we will see our inventories smooth out over the course of the year and be in a manageable position for the remainder of the year. i do not know if there's anything you'd add, kathee? the thing that i would add, matt, is we're working on making sure that our forecasts are accurate. and then, as we buy into them, that we've got chase and cancel plans built in, so that we're able to react in-season versus what we've done this past year without any history and having to react at the end of the season to clear more. so, we are still lumpy SEMICOLON we still have product to clear, but we're getting our arms around that forecast, and i think that will help us as we move through the year.
46;3;212;0;0.0;sure, on the first question of the ceo search, certainly that's under the board's purview, and i would tell you, rather than focused on time, they are focused on getting the right individual to lead the company, as i said, to become an omnichannel retailer. so, that's their focus SEMICOLON and the time will take as long as is appropriate to get the right person. on the second one, on share repurchase, and specifically related to the potential breach liabilities, getting visibility to that in the second half a year, there's a process that is agreed to with the networks. they get some information from their forensics investigator, and then they go through a process to evaluate incremental fraud where we may have potential liability. and then they come back to us after a period of time. and as we've looked at that historically, we've seen that that's taken several months, and that's why we get to the third quarter. we do not have, frankly, bob, a lot of visibility to that, but as i said, as we looked at other incidents, that's what we've seen in the past for timing of when some of those potential liabilities may become more clear.
46;4;431;6;0.013921113689095127;sure, i will talk maybe a little bit about where we are today, and kathee can talk about what we're doing to drive growth there. the sales in our business, somewhere between 2% and 3% digital channel originated -- probably in the 2.5% range right now. redcards: given the free shipping online, we have a lot of our redcard guests shopping online. and i think, we talked in the past, greg, we have a very high penetration of online orders that we free ship because of that redcard. we think it's absolutely the right incentive or part of that loyalty package for redcard, but it drives a very high penetration and, kathee, you can talk about where we're going. in terms of growth, greg, mobile is where we're really focused, and about two-thirds of our traffic right now comes from mobile. so, we're really pleased with the results that we've seen there, not only in traffic but also conversion. we did improve conversion, both on the site and on mobile, and in total. and you know that mobile conversion is lower than site conversion. so, that headwind from the mix is there, but we still improved overall conversion. so, we're happy with that. there's also a lot of new things that we're doing. certainly there's product introductions SEMICOLON i talked about the furniture a few minutes ago. there's always new stuff that we're adding on the site. we're expanding. we've got almost all store product online now set up online SEMICOLON lots to be sold online. but now we're adding out in other areas where we should have a much larger selection, and we think online is the place to do that SEMICOLON things like apparel, home, beauty. in addition to that, there's a lot of services that we are adding that are doing really well. we've talked about buy online, pick up in store SEMICOLON subscriptions has been really successful for us. we started last fall with about 150 skus, and those items -- our online sales were about 15% in subscriptions, with no marketing, just beta on the site. so, we've now got about 1,500 items SEMICOLON and by june, we will have 5,000 items that will be available for subscriptions. and when guests purchase those items, they will be able to get a 5% discount for signing up for subscriptions. so, a lot of product and a lot of services that go with that, to drive our growth.
46;5;74;3;0.04054054054054054;yes, if you mean for an annual number, getting to an annual positive traffic number, very difficult. we're working hard on increasing traffic for each of the quarters, and i think our benchmark is: are we seeing continued improvement in traffic as we go sequentially? but for the full year, even if we just pick a number, ran a 1% comp, i do not think we will see positive traffic for the year.
46;6;452;4;0.008849557522123894;i do not think there's a target level of investment. i think, first, from a capex standpoint, our approach has been: we're going to invest in all the investments the business needs to grow profitably and generate appropriate returns. the length of time over which those returns occur -- we have a very long lead time as we think about capital investment. stores have a very long return cycle, so we're used to making investments that pay back over a long period of time. from an expense standpoint, i think there probably the biggest investment and where you will see us accelerate is in speed, and doing more testing and learning. and that's not just digital, but also in our store -- just getting more activities out into the business that we're testing, we're modifying, and adjusting and improving on. and if it does not work, pull it back and retreat from that and learn from the testing. i think the best example of that is cartwheel. we put that out in beta SEMICOLON we knew there were things about the app that we did not particularly like. our guests let us know what they did not like about the app. the team iterated and iterated, and one year later, and really not with much marketing until more recently, we have 7 million users, and the app has evolved as our guests have provided us feedback. and as kathee talked about, a lot of the merchandising initiatives in baby and in apparel and in toys and in electronics, that's the same approach we take, and get it out in the stores, modify it, test it somewhere else and modify it, and then we will move to scale. so, those are the investments we will see in expense, and i do not think that is limited by some false number of expense dollars we have to allocate toward it. it will be driven by the appropriateness of what we're testing. the thing that i would add to that, matt, the reason for getting more out, historically we've tended to work on our newness until we felt we got it to an almost complete level and then we would put it into pilot. the point now, and john's point about cartwheel and some of the in-store things that we're doing, we want to get it in front of our guest very quickly, get their reaction to it so that we're fine tuning it much more quickly and then able to move out -- to roll out at a much faster pace with a product and a service that we know our guests will love.
46;7;170;9;0.052941176470588235;yes, as we said, we continued to see improvement across the business into april, as the guest data improved and our sales performance improved. and the early cycle stores continue to be the best. and it's, again, almost in order down the sheet: cycle one, cycle two, cycle three, cycle four, cycle five. so, the earliest stores, the longer they have been open, they perform the better. but the good thing is: all cycles on an upward path. we're not where we need to be, and we're not where we need to be versus our expectations, but it's good to start to see some progress. i think the key to each of those cycles and improving them is getting this history under our belt, and now we can forecast more accurately as we move forward. and as john said, we're very committed to accelerating our performance in canada, and we think that it will continue to go by cycle as it has this past year.
46;8;235;2;0.00851063829787234;i will take the second one, and then kathee can answer the first. on sales tax, we definitely see an impact when amazon collects sales tax, and particularly in states that have much higher sales taxes to begin with, where essentially the price differential is much more meaningful. so, we've definitely seen that impact as we've watched them collect sales taxes across the country. and, kathee, you can talk about the rest. in terms of our online business, the part that i'm very encouraged about is that, as comscore reports when we look at traffic on our site versus the top seven retailers, we led by far. and obviously, amazon has a lot of traffic, but it was flat in the quarter, and ours was up considerably. so, i'm pleased with that the changes that we're making to the site with the user experience and the added product that we're adding is driving that guest behavior and that we're seeing the traffic. clearly, amazon is doing very well, and they have, in the consumables category, a lot of business. we are now ramping that up, starting with the more style-related consumable business. if you think beauty, for example, you will see us pushing forward there faster versus grocery, which we're doing dry grocery now, but we're not working on refrigerated and frozen at this point.
46;9;357;7;0.0196078431372549;at this point, i do not think we're ready to commit to what that will do from a financial perspective. our main focus right now is what will most resonate with our guest SEMICOLON getting pilots out in beta so that we can learn and experience from them. ultimately, we have to work to be profitable on all of those. but our main goal right now is sales driven and understanding guest behavior so that we can then tailor the assortment to suit them and be profitable at it. i will tell you i've been really pleased with some of these new initiatives and how rapidly our guest is responding to them. store pick-up is the biggest because it's now rolled out. but ship from store, which was really a minneapolis team member test so far, we're going to be expanding that in june and make that guest-facing, having that $10 rush delivery in boston, minneapolis and miami. and based on our team member response and the feedback that they gave us, i think that this will also resonate with our guests. so i'm really excited to see where that goes. and then, later in the year, we're going to be adding standard shipping from 135 stores in about 38 markets, and that will allow faster delivery, not the express that i just talked about, but 1- to 2-day delivery, and as well as provide access to the store assortment that you can not get right now on target.com. so, lots of good things happening. not yet ready to say what it means in terms of our sales or our profit. i think kathee's exactly right. not ready to give a lot of guidance on sales profit and how it will all work out. but i would tell you, broadly, regardless of where the profit margin rates end up, pushing incremental sales across our existing assets will be a very good thing for return on invested capital, and we're very excited about that. and with that, i think we have time for one more question.
46;10;156;7;0.04487179487179487;well, i think the point is that we want to accelerate newness and innovation in this interim period here. we've talked about: interim does not mean idle. we are approaching our business with as much passion and focus on improving results as we always have. and in terms of this structure, i think, as john mentioned, focusing on our top three priorities and having this merchant team really focused on the us, improving us performance, and leveraging deep, functional expertise to be able to speed up that innovation and newness. so, for example, putting all of our style business together, both merchandising and design all under trish adams SEMICOLON having our essentials and hardlines business all under jose barra. having all inventory and all operations under keri jones, and then our omnichannel efforts all under casey carl, are really important to be able to leverage that expertise and move very quickly in improving our results.
46;11;53;3;0.05660377358490566;i will just tell you that the board has been very supportive on these changes. we've talked at length about getting the right people in the right chair to be able to drive our performance, and we're really pleased with this structure and the people that we have leading these teams.
46;12;107;4;0.037383177570093455;as we've been focusing on irresistible deals for our guests, we've invested in both sides. i gave you the example of the coke ad that we ran in, i think it was in march, but we've also done broad categories on the want side like the ultimate spring break sale or our baby sales. we're looking at really needs and wants, and how do we invest in both sides to be able to delight our guests, and we've had great success in both categories. thank you. thanks. well, that concludes our first-quarter 2014 conference call. thank you all for your participation.
47;1;216;4;0.018518518518518517;wayne, let me start by answering your first question. my focus, right now, is to really understand the business in both the us and canada. and i'm spending a lot of time with john and kathee and the team to understand the guest perspective on target, how we improve our traffic, how we enhance our performance in canada, and how we continue to build out -- and rapidly build out -- our omnichannel capabilities. so i'm very focused on making sure that we're going to make progress against those key three initiatives, as i continue to look at the broader and longer term strategic options. so my focus is really understanding the business today and strategy before we have any discussions around organization modifications, going forward. and then wayne, in terms of the unit per transaction, most of that was driven by higher dollar items that we were selling -- things in electronics and in entertainment. so you see the healthy selling price, as you mentioned, but fewer units. the other portion of that, i would say, is that we are seeing really good momentum in our trade-up strategies. so we are selling, in some cases fewer units, but higher price points in other categories across the company. but it's predominantly electronics and entertainment.
47;2;136;2;0.014705882352941176;yes, david, there's no doubt that with e-commerce being as immature as it is, there is some pressure on gross margin. we are committed to going where our guests go, and they want to be able to shop online. and we are going to make sure that we've got all the right products for them, both online and in our stores. that does give us a little headwind on the gross margin. but as you pointed out, all of the newness that we're bringing in -- the things that our guests love most about target -- that helps to offset it. so we do not have a number to share with you today, but we are very focused on driving sales, going where the guest is, and offering them those products that delight them.
47;3;269;4;0.01486988847583643;on the gross margin rate, i think kathee said it really well. we're going to go where the guest is and meet them -- provide the product they want, where they want it, when they want it, and how they want it. but there's a lot of tools in our tool kit to manage gross margin rate. there's certainly the product that kathee talked about -- emphasizing the style categories with newness and differentiation. beyond that, there's the flexible fulfillment options, where we lower shipping expense by moving the product closer to our guest. and also, ultimately, balancing inventories better across the entire network and reducing mark downs that we incur today. so there are lots of puts and takes. and like kathee said, we do not have it all sorted out today. we'll provide more information as we do. but i think there are lots of puts and takes, as we think about gross margin rate more broadly. on the store hourly payroll -- first, on the extended hours, the investment there was immaterial to the quarter. again, that was about half the stores adding one hour of operations. so not significant investment there. but with tina schiel, our head of stores, we continually talk about ensuring that we're striking the right balance between productivity in those stores and we have great guest service results. what we see today, our guest survey scores are as high as they've ever been, and the team continues to drive really strong expense control. so we feel good about where we are today. but we constantly evaluate that.
47;4;200;6;0.03;matthew, as i mentioned earlier, i spent time just last week with the canadian team. and i'm certainly aware that the expansion has been challenging. and from a target standpoint, we've disappointed many of our canadian guests. kathee's already referenced the fact that we're conducting an in-depth evaluation of our canadian business. that began several months ago. and we're certainly looking to make material improvements in that business. right now, short term, the focus is on improving in-stock conditions, our pricing, and assortment and really ensuring that we've got plans in place to improve our performance in the holiday upcoming. so you can expect me to be spending quite a bit of time with the canadian team, along with kathee, to make sure we understand the opportunities SEMICOLON we understand the challenges that we have to address SEMICOLON and we're focused on improving in-stocks, our value position, and assortment as we go forward. so i'm going to spend, clearly, the balance of the year working very closely with that team to make sure we've got plans in place to improve performance as we go into the holiday season.
47;5;146;1;0.00684931506849315;we did add it to the chain all at the same time. we do not have any markets that are more mature. we did do a little testing with team members in minneapolis before we rolled out. but basically, we rolled it all around november 1 of last year to all stores. and we have been very pleased with the results from buy online, pick up in store. and about 14% of our digital sales today are being picked up in store. and then when they go to store to pick up those orders, we're seeing about 20% of those guests shop in the store to pick up additional items. and there's a very healthy basket with that, as well. so still early, but very promising. we think it saves guests time, it saves them money, and it allows them to consolidate their shopping.
47;6;130;3;0.023076923076923078;yes. sure. you're right. it was -- the goal for expense optimization -- about $650 million incremental to last year, which gets us to $850 million total. of the $650 million this year -- just rough numbers -- about $200 million of that was on the gross margin line, coming out of cost of goods. more of that back-weighted than front-weighted. we're probably about a little bit more than a third of the way through that. probably a little bit more than that -- maybe half the way through that. so there was definitely some benefit in the quarter from expense optimization. that was also true in the first quarter. both quarters have benefited. but later in the year, we'll see more benefit as we continue to grow those savings.
47;7;60;2;0.03333333333333333;yes. it builds as the year goes on. we're annualizing on the, roughly, $200 million we saved last year. that was primarily sg&a. there's probably a little bit more good news in sg&a right now, but that will continue to build, as well, as we go throughout the year. thank you. good to be back, greg.
47;8;264;6;0.022727272727272728;greg, i'm going to quickly immerse myself in the details of the business, both here in the us and canada. and john and kathee and the leadership team have already spent hours with me walking through a lot of the strategic work that they've been doing over the last 90 days. as i said earlier, during my very first week, i visited the canadian market to spend time with that team, and i want to be a good student of the business. but clearly, we have to have a sense of urgency here and a sense of pace. and while i want to study the business and, certainly, listen and learn from our team, no one is happy with our current performance. and our focus, right now, is to make sure we've got plans in place in the short term to improve traffic. we've got plans in place to improve our performance in canada. and we've got to continue to move faster, from a digital and mobile standpoint, to meet the needs of our guests. so you can expect a clear sense of urgency. but i, certainly, want to make sure i give myself the time to listen, learn, understand the business, both from our team's standpoint but also from the eyes of the target guest. and you can expect me to dive in very quickly to understand the business, to look for the opportunities, and to work with the leadership team to develop very focused priorities, as we go forward into 2015 and beyond. thank you, greg.
47;9;270;14;0.05185185185185185;yes, matt. i think it's more about product and the newness that we have on the floor for back-to-school, back-to-college. we've seen both of those start off really strong. even in their peak weeks, those stores are doing better the week after their peak. so we're seeing it stronger in the peak and then get even stronger after that. so i think it's really product related and newness. certainly, we've had promotions. most of them are devoted to those core categories like apparel, some of the back-to-college items. but the guest, right now, is more focused on the occasion than they are on the promotion. so that is very encouraging to us, and i think it's product-driven. matt, if i could, just early days -- but the current performance on back-to-school and the way kathee and the team have put back-to-school together at target has been very impressive to me. and i think it's a great example of getting the product right, the right balance of newness and innovation, great advertising communication that really captures the guest's attention, and very strong in-store and online execution. so i think that's one of the great examples that we're going to continue to build from, as we go forward. i think kathee and the entire team have brought back-to-school to life -- back-to-college to life -- with the right products, the right newness and innovation, great advertising communication to support it, and then very strong in-store and online execution.
47;10;171;0;0.0;upt down 8% in canada, matt. i think a lot of that -- what i would tell you is, a lot of noise going on in the canada comp, overall. so much of the surge last year, we saw very different types of transactions than we saw once we moved past that, as we opened stores. we saw that in each cycle. very different behavior for those -- i do not know -- four to six weeks when we had the surge period. and then, as the business settled down and got into a more normal state, we saw more routine transaction counts and baskets. what i would tell you is, we're going to continue to see this. it's going to be noisy in q3. and really, it will not be until we get to q4, when we've cycled past all the opening cycles -- all the densification -- that we get a real read on what's going on, on a comparable basis from the business year-over-year. thanks. thank you.
47;11;2;0;0.0;thanks, matt.
47;12;149;3;0.020134228187919462;well, have not thought about it in terms of innings, matt. but i'll tell you, we are excited about what we have coming for the fall season. i highlighted a lot of things that are coming in september and october. but then moving on to the fourth quarter, which we will not be specific about today, but we're excited about what that brings as well. we have about 85,000 items in our assortment, and we'll have 35,000 new items this fall season. so i do feel pretty optimistic about the content, the quality, the trend, the presentation. but, clearly, in spring, i think you'll see that will be a full cycle out. and we'll have much more to come, as we turn the corner into the spring season. matt, thank you. operator, i think we've got time for one last question.
47;13;220;5;0.022727272727272728;yes. the guest that shops target online is absolutely our best guest. they shop both online and in stores. it's really all about what's convenient for them, and sometimes it's just easier to knock an item off your list by buying it on your mobile device. sometimes you want to purchase it online but pick it up in store to do the rest. but this is absolutely our best guest and one we will not cede. we will go after being a seamless, omnichannel retailer with confidence, knowing that it's the best thing for our guest and best thing for our business. and i do think that, when you think about the lapsed guests, they're basically back. so traffic changes are more about consolidated trips and trips shifting online. so it's an important part for us to own, which is why you see all of the efforts in our omnichannel capabilities and strategies -- with subscriptions and with personalization and with ship from store and buy online, pick up in store. there's a lot of things that we're putting effort into that will help drive that momentum. right. simeon, thank you for the question. that concludes our target second-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. i thank all of you for your participation today.
48;1;96;1;0.010416666666666666;yes, i think a couple things. certainly there would likely be some benefits if we continue to see fuel prices come down. but we have not reached the threshold where fuel surcharges begin to come out of our contracts. and i think importantly, given the great work the team has done to manage some of the port issues out west, we're working around that and moving some freight further, expediting some freight, flying some freight, and i think net-net, that will probably be more of a drag than any fuel savings we will see.
48;2;84;0;0.0;yes, sean, this is kathee. it's predominantly a mix story for us. so we have higher ticket items like all the apple products, including the launch of the iphone 6 in the quarter. we've got video game consoles that are higher. we have a lot of trade-up strategies both in essentials, like you talked about, like in grocery with organics, but also in areas like skin care, which i described a little bit earlier. so this is really a mix story.
48;3;2;0;0.0;correct, correct.
48;4;292;6;0.02054794520547945;hi, matt. yes, i think the expense savings, i would tell you we've talked about the expense optimization efforts all year. been very focused on that and has been across the entire enterprise. and we've seen good news in sg&a and also in cost of goods. the couple of areas i would point out, the store's performance has been outstanding, driving productivity increases while still continuing to remain very strong guest service scores. frankly, our guest service scores historically, so we've seen great performance there. and then it's really many other areas. there's been great work done in marketing around the circular, there's been great work done in our transportation and how we optimize our network of transportation. so really across the enterprise. i think importantly to your question about going forward, we believe there continues to be significant opportunity for us to continue to take expense out and so for the foreseeable future, we would expect to continue to see expenses very well controlled and to lever expenses at really relatively modest increases in sales. matt, it's brian. and to build on john's point and as i discussed in my prepared comments, as we move forward, we recognize that we're going to continue to need to focus on expense management to fuel the investments we're going to make to drive continued growth across our store base and our digital platform. so as we come back to you in the spring and we talk more specifically about our strategy, you should expect us to continue to talk about cost optimization efforts and how we'll use those efforts to reinvest in the fuel that's going to drive our growth.
48;5;142;2;0.014084507042253521;yes, it's not accretive. i will tell you, we do ship even prior to the holiday free shipping, we do free ship a lot more than perhaps you would think and certainly more than some of our competitors, given redcard and the fact that ships free all year around. so we have seen -- we know it's the number one frustration with our guests and the number one reason for abandoned carts. and so it was important for us this holiday season to be able to take that friction away and we have seen a meaningful move in orders and conversion because of it. so we are very pleased with the results so far. matt, the only thing i'd add, while not accretive, the other thing i would add is not material either to our results in the fourth quarter.
48;6;561;13;0.023172905525846704;oliver, i think as we go forward, and as kathee and the team really elevate our focus around those signature categories, categories like baby and kids, wellness and style, you should expect to see additional focus in-store. you should see additional innovation, partnerships, but really ensuring that we're leading with trend. we're anticipating what our guest is looking for in those categories, and those are categories that target becomes famous for. and we're certainly going to double down our efforts in those categories because our guest has asked us to. they're categories that are very important to our guests. they're synonymous with the target experience the guest is expecting. and you'll see signs of that as we move into 2015 and beyond. certainly, some of the work that kathee and her team have done in preparation for the fourth quarter are already bringing our efforts to light in apparel. some of the things that we've done in home, the partnerships that kathee talked about in her prepared comments, our continued focus on baby and kids. and we know how important toys are during the holiday season. so we're already making progress in those spaces. but i also want to make sure it's really clear that does not mean we're walking away from other categories in our stores. they just play a different role in our future strategy. and they'll continue to be areas where we're going to look to improve our execution and performance. but from a prioritization standpoint, we think those signature categories that we've talked about are key to the guest. the guest has told us those are critically important to them. and kathee and her team are working rapidly to ensure that we continue to build our position, enhance our assortment, and bring great newness and innovation to those key categories. so couple things that i would add to that that you will already see in stores right now. brian talked about those four areas, baby, kids, wellness and style. so in baby, about 200 stores have a new presentation where we've invested in labor in the stores to help guests create registry and gift givers find the perfect gifts. we've added mannequins and things that help the presentation. i also shared today that the registry that we have redone completely, the whole experience, from the in-store hardware to the software that we use and how that helps guests create registries much easier, we're already seeing the benefit of that. wellness, we've talked a lot about made to matter, better-for-you products, and you see that already this year. and then in style, to touch on that for a minute, we now have about 650 stores that have our new presentation in apparel, including mannequins. so already some progress and we will continue to push forward in those areas and you'll see more and more as the months and year goes on. however, the final point i'd add as we think about style, certainly apparel and home are critically important in that space, but so is beauty. and as john and kathee have referenced, beauty was one of our standout categories in the third quarter, and we expect continued strong performance as we exit the year.
48;7;456;11;0.02412280701754386;oliver i think we're making progress across a number of different areas. certainly, we talked about omnichannel and really making sure that we are a significant player in this space. and we're seeing very strong performance, up over 30% in the third quarter. john talked about the fact that we expect that performance to accelerate in q4. we clearly took away the pain point of shipping by announcing free ship in the fourth quarter. and we think that's another way for us to declare we are significantly committed to this space. we're seeing a great response to cartwheel, 11 million users to date. and we're going to use that to make sure that we use digital as the front door to connect to the target brand going forward. we've talked about some of the progress that's being made in merchandising and we've got 35,000 new items in stores for the holiday. and we're going to continue to test and partner as we continue to make sure we're bringing the right solutions to our guests. if you have not seen some of the holiday creative, i think it's some of the best target's delivered in years. and i'm getting e-mails and comments from guests and friends and people i know every day talking about their reaction to the holiday creative and how the creative campaign, it's uniquely target. and we're certainly upping our game both in-store. but we're also going to spend significantly more in digital this year, to touch our guests no matter how they're connecting with the brand. in-store, we've made significant progress in a very short period of time, going from testing ship from store to now we're in 38 markets, 136 stores, where our stores are acting like flexible fulfillment centers. you can shop there, you can pick up there. but they're also shipping to, directly to our guests and allows us to cover 90% of our marketplace in a very short period of time. takes the pain away from that last mile. so i think you're going to continue to see us make these points. and that's a sneak peek of target in the future. and i think that is creating positive energy in the organization. kathee and i are hearing really positive things from our vendors. our organization knows we've got to be more -- we've got to show more agility. we've got to be responsive. we've got to make sure we're externally focused and following the guest. but i think you're seeing some of those things take shape today.
48;8;296;11;0.037162162162162164;wayne, we have not modeled exactly what that will be yet. but i would tell you, i think that it will be moving up for a couple of reasons. so you heard brian talk about those areas that we're going to focus on and really being famous for them and delighting our guests. and when we are at our best, we offer both expect more, pay less together in all of these categories. and that means a really thoughtful balance of good, better, best, having clear features and benefits as we move up that ladder, allowing guests to be able to buy whatever's important to them. but importantly, offering really good trade-up opportunities. so you're seeing some of that right now in some categories. but i think as we move forward and we become famous, again, for some of these categories, there will be a lot of trade-up opportunity. so i would say overall, seeing it moving up. and then wayne, your second question, inventory, i think the one thing i'd say, if you look at our number this quarter, 6% to 7% all the us, really only about a third of this do we view as temporary. the vast majority of that was receipt timing. but that third, we expect to stay around. we started that in second quarter this year. we'll cycle it again next year in second quarter, somewhere around a 2% to 3% increase for the first half of next year. but offsetting that ultimately, as we start to get back to positive comp sales, we should see faster turn. that should ultimately lead to better payables leverage. so not a meaningful impact overall once we get past fourth quarter here on our working capital.
48;9;148;1;0.006756756756756757;on margin, it's definitely dilutive, greg, if for no other reason than the shipping expense. and i think as it continues to grow, that will put margin pressure on the p&l. and we've talked a little bit about this. there are lots of puts and takes in gross margin as we think about it going forward that we're working through today. as that business grows, it will be margin dilutive. but as we increase penetration of ship from store and pick up in store, that significantly not only improves our guest experience, but significantly improves the p&l. we're also balancing how we look at pricing right now and balancing inventories across the network as we ship from store. so some of those are up, some of those are down. and we're working through right now where ultimately gross margin will land.
48;10;171;3;0.017543859649122806;greg, we're assessing that right now as we think about 2015 and beyond. but you should expect us to be investing in the capabilities to continue to build out our digital experience. to continue to enhance our in-store experience. to make sure we have the analytical tools to properly manage expenses and margin even more surgically going forward. and i talked about -- while certainly in the early stages, we're going to continue to look at smaller formats and how we use smaller formats to penetrate urban markets, allow our guest the chance to interact with the target brand both in-store, but also continue to build out the opportunity for them to purchase online. so we're in the early stages of assessing our long-term capital needs, but you should expect us to be investing in the right capabilities and tools to provide long-term shareholder value and allow us to continue to fuel our growth and enhance both margins and continue to manage operating expenses effectively.
48;11;115;0;0.0;greg, we think -- at least brian said i think with the caveat that we're working through this right now, we think we're probably in about the right range right now. the spend may move around a little bit. i think the one wild card is the point brian made about small formats. but i would note that obviously the investment there is significantly below what a prototypical target would look like. so it would take a lot of those to meaningfully move our capex number. like we've talked about, something for the us in that $2 billion, $2.5 billion range still makes sense, but we're doing the work right now.
48;12;48;0;0.0;yes, most of it is marketing moved around. and the magnitude, if you think about us beating by somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.09, it was a little bit less than half the beat. so somewhere in that $30 million to $40 million moved between the quarters.
48;13;90;2;0.022222222222222223;well, i would not want to get into that level of detail. clearly, last year pre breach was stronger than post breach, and we took that into account as we thought about the calendarization of the plan. and right now we're running ahead of that and we feel good about where we're at, not only relative to the plan, but on an absolute basis is what i'd say. but there is a lot of business left to be done before we get to the end of january.
48;14;313;4;0.012779552715654952;yes and let's drop back and make sure we clarify our point on the food category. we have no intentions today to streamline those categories, but kathee and the team are certainly stepping back and listening to the guest, really understanding what the target guest is looking for in food. from an assortment standpoint, from a newness standpoint, we talked about the fact that as we go forward, you should expect to see more natural and organic offerings. we've seen a terrific response from the guest as something that we call made to matter, a collection of items that are on trend for our target guest, feature a number of exclusive items that target from manufacturers that are in the organic and natural space, that can bring great innovation, gluten-free, on-trend products to our guests. and we certainly recognize that we have an opportunity to connect with the guest in a different way when it comes to food. but you should not expect us to deemphasize those categories. that's not the point. we're not streamlining our food offering, but we are stepping back and really listening to the guest, making sure we curate on their behalf the right items that are uniquely target, that meet the needs of our guests in the food categories. so a lot more to come as we talk about this in the first quarter, but to make sure we're really clear, we're not streamlining food. we're not deemphasizing food. we're not walking away from food. but we certainly want to make sure we put our mark on the food category with items that are uniquely target, that are right for our guests, that are on trend. and you should certainly expect to see more natural, organic offerings in that space because the target guest has asked for them.
48;15;107;0;0.0;we would certainly expect to see that. and kathee talked about some of the changes we're seeing in mix. and certainly when we talk about natural organic and when we talk about some of these unique items, they tend to have a higher average unit rank. so you should expect to see some mix changes, but importantly, food is an important part of our future. we're not going to deemphasize the category. we're not looking to take away space. we want it to be more impactful, more on trend, and we want to fill it with items that the target guest is looking for.
48;16;16;0;0.0;that concludes target's third-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. thank you all for your participation.
49;1;149;1;0.006711409395973154;sure, i'll start, and i'm sure kathee will jump in. but i think overall, what you observed is there's strictly some savings relative to last year with the clearance activity that went on. but i think much more important to that is, you saw the acceleration of the signature categories SEMICOLON home, apparel, style, kids. many of those with margin rates well in excess of our average margin rate. and i think for the first time, kathee and i could not even remember the last time where both home and apparel out-comped the company. so we saw a very strong mix in the quarter, delivered by the product in the stores. yes, so on top of the mix, i would also say that regular priced sell-through was very high. so less on clearance or mark down, and more at full retail which also contributed.
49;2;288;5;0.017361111111111112;we do not disclose the average wage for our team members. what i would tell you is, the store's team has always been appointed differentiation for target. and we've always prided ourselves, and believe we have the best team in retail. so very focused on ensuring we have competitive wages and that we're developing our team members. we're all the time assessing the marketplace to determine competitive wages and making adjustments, and we feel very confident that we'll be paying the teams appropriately. i think importantly, if you look at our team leaders, 60% of them came from team members. so development is a really big part of what we offer to our team as they progress. overall as we look at some of the announcements that have been made and the marketplace and the minimum wage legislation that's been [enacted], really has not changed our view of the quarter or the year really at all. and will not be material changes to us. i just want to build on that. i'm sure we're going to receive this question again next week. but to john's point, and our goal is to make sure we have the very best team in retail. and we're going to continue to invest in their development. and make sure that from a marketplace standpoint, we're very competitive with the wages we provide. so i've been very pleased to learn that over 60% of our team leaders actually started as part-time hourly employees. that development is critically important. it allows us to attract terrific team members. and as john stated, we do not expect to see any material change next year.
49;3;218;7;0.03211009174311927;well it's certainly going to be an area that we'll highlight next week. and i think you've captured it really, really well. our focus right now throughout the organization is to reduce complexity, simplify the way we work, the way we operate each and every day, continue to empower our team members to make the right decisions that are going to impact the business. we want to create an organization that's much more agile, that moves with much increased pace as we go forward. and we deliver the right innovation and product that our guest is looking for. so it is a significant area of focus for us. we're going to talk about it in great detail. but we think it's going to be a very important part of our strategy going forward. it's going to fuel the key growth priorities that we've been talking about, and we'll go through in great detail next week. but our goal is to make sure we eliminate complexity at target, we simplify our operating model. we empower our team members. and create an environment where we're agile, we're taking advantage of marketplace opportunities, and we're bringing products and services to market that respond to the needs of our guest.
49;4;53;1;0.018867924528301886;actually, the return rates were higher than our expectation, but they were essentially right on last year. we had seen some improvement throughout most of the year, and they basically just returned to last year. so not a material change. just a little bit different than our expectation for the last couple weeks.
49;5;454;16;0.03524229074889868;scott, while there's certainly a number of critically important metrics as we look at the business going forward. i can tell you that the entire leadership team has prioritized, one, increasing traffic to our stores, and two, visits to our site. those are critically important as we go forward. so we're going to do that by executing many of the priorities that we outlined today. we certainly want to make sure we're building the right digital, and importantly mobile capabilities, that drive greater visits to our site and build greater engagement with our guests. not only when they're shopping at home, but also when they're shopping inside of our stores. and cartwheel is a great example of how we've used digital to drive greater engagement. i am really pleased, and kathee highlighted the fact that our signature categories drove our growth in the fourth quarter. and it's critically important that while we're in the early stages, we're already seeing the guests react well to our focus on style, on baby, and kids, and importantly wellness. and the fact that healthcare and beauty and home and apparel outpaced our overall performance in the fourth quarter, is a sign that we're connecting with the guest. and we're certainly driving more of the traffic because of these great new offerings in store. so our focus on elevating signature categories, we think brings our guest back to target more often. they're going to be coming back in to see what's new. and kathee and her team have a great lineup in 2015 of new exciting products, coupled with an improvement in our in-store experience and merchandising. so those elements are critically important. we think localization allows us to build a more meaningful relationship with the guest, which will result in more traffic and more visits. and certainly as we expand our smaller formats. both city target and target express, it's a way for us to engage the guest in these urban settings that are critically important. so all of those are focused on making sure we build greater engagement. but the metrics that are going to be important for us is to ensure it results in more traffic, like it did in the fourth quarter, and more visits to our site. so we're pleased with q4. lots of work in front of us. but i felt very good, as did the entire leadership team, that our comp increase of 3.8% in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by traffic. and our industry-leading growth in digital was certainly going to be fueled by more visits and better conversion from our site.
49;6;264;6;0.022727272727272728;scott, i think you already know the answer to that, and we're going to talk about this specifically next week. food is very important to our guests. and they've confirmed that with us as we've gone back and researched the food category through the eyes of the guest recently. we all know food trips drive traffic. and we want to make sure we compliment our signature categories with guests that are coming to us for the great food products we can curate. we recognize we have a lot of work to do in food. and kathee and i were recently out in the market together. we spent several days visiting our stores, looking at competitive food retailers, as we begin to build our reinvention plans for food. but as kathee will talk about next week, we recognize we need to make changes to our assortment. made to matter and some of the changes we're making right now in our assortment that deliver more organic, natural, gluten-free items critically important to the guest. and we also recognize we have to change the in-store experience, and really make sure our food and grocery merchandising compliments the great experience we create at target. so a critically important area of opportunity. we will not get there overnight. it will be a multi-year transition. but food is going to play a very important role in complimenting our other signature categories, and making sure we drive traffic to our stores and to our site. scott, thanks. hopefully we'll see you next week.
49;7;219;10;0.045662100456621;matt, we'll certainly go through much more of this next week. i think if you were to look at the changes we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter, the big change would have been a significant increase in our digital support of our brands. so as we continue to make sure we're connecting with our guests, we're connecting with them the way they're looking to connect with the target brand, digital is going to play an increasingly important role. and we were very pleased with our overall marketing in the fourth quarter. we had some outstanding creative on air. it received very positive response from the guest, and we complimented that with a very strong digital campaign. so i felt and the team felt very good about the progress we made from a marketing standpoint in the fourth quarter. we had creative that broke through the clutter, connected with our guest, drove traffic to our stores. we complimented that with really impactful digital and online communication, and tied that back in with great in-store marketing. so you'll see more of that as we go forward into 2015. and we'll take you through a lot more of the investments and the plans we have when we see you next week.
49;8;155;6;0.03870967741935484;sean, we're going to talk about food in much more depth next week. but fresh is a very important part of food. not only traffic and number of trips for our guests, but just in terms of what's important to them, in terms of wellness. fresh food plays a very important part. and as brian said, we've got a lot of work to do here. so both in super target as well as in p fresh format. and it centers around our assortment, how fresh the product is, and ways that we can improve upon that, the presentation, showing abundance in that great product. so we have a lot of work to do. but critically important to us because our guest has said they want to be able to eat better both natural and organic. we see it in our results today. and we know that there's much, much more opportunity.
49;9;64;0;0.0;sure. lots of variability across categories, as is always the case. we saw some inflation in food. we saw a lot of deflation in electronics, like we always do. but if you look across the entirety of our business, essentially flat to last year. so no net impact to the business from inflation in aggregate, but as i said, lots of variability within that.
49;10;408;12;0.029411764705882353;michael, let me start, and i'll let kathee and john jump in. i think you've certainly identified some of the big levers. and i think as we sit here today, we recognize that the consumer confidence has certainly improved. lower gas prices, certainly helping the industry overall. we did have some favorable overlaps certainly as we overlapped the breach. but i also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint, from a marketing standpoint, and we continue to deliver great execution and service inside the stores. and when you look at the two year stacks, we had a very challenging november, a very strong november from 2013 that we overlapped and saw growth. that to me was a sign that not only was the consumer healthier, but they were choosing to spend their dollars in target stores. and they came back in december, as kathee alluded to. we had a very strong close to the holiday season. but importantly, we felt really good about traffic and our performance in january, particularly in the last two weeks of the quarter. so a combination of we certainly did have some issues from last year that we are overlapping. the consumer, we do believe is healthier. and we're pleased that they're spending in our stores, both in our stores and online. but i also think we made significant strides from a merchandising standpoint. we had terrific marketing, and a great digital connection with our guest. we were able to leverage both an improved in-store experience, the convenience of shopping online and picking up in store. and we had industry-leading online sales, and we leveraged our stores to help make sure that we fulfilled the needs of our guest. so i think the combination of all those elements added up to a very solid quarter. the only thing that i would add to that is just that a lot of that focus came in our signature categories, which is why you saw our growth there in particular. so major investment in product, both quality as well as aesthetic, and number of skus, newness that we brought to the market. the marketing reinforced that, and that was very well received by our guest. and then coupled with presentation, both online with enhancements in our app and our desktop site. and the presentation in our store, driven by focus on signature categories really helped drive our growth.
49;11;294;5;0.017006802721088437;i think we continued to see gift card redemption. we intentionally -- we had a significant gift card promotion on black friday that was very successful. we saw all of those come back in january. i think that helped. and we saw continued strength in the product in home and apparel. very strong sales in home and apparel, and i think that was an element of it as well. and i think that it's a combination of both. and our wellness business is healthy. as we turn the corner in to the new year, we saw that continue. so the trade up that we had seen during christmas, we saw continue into january. which is just guest choice for products in our discretionary categories. so i think lots of things drove it. michael, i think, well summarized. i would put four elements on the list. john talked about gift cards, i think that was very important. and we certainly saw our guest come back to target with gift cards after the holidays in through january. our focus on wellness, certainly well received by the guest. we had great newness in our stores to start the new year. and our store teams did a terrific job of recovering of the holidays. and we offered our guest a very strong in-store shopping experience. so a lot of the basics. but our gift card plans were well executed. we saw the guest come back in january. our focus on wellness, that important signature category. well received. we brought newness into the stores to start the year. and our store teams did a traffic job of recovering after a very busy christmas holiday season. thank you. i think we've got time for one more question today.
49;12;180;10;0.05555555555555555;health and beauty were both very strong. so in the health categories, that spread across many categories. i talked about made to matter. i talked about better for you product in food. but it was also in our health business and our style business. both beauty was strong, as well as in apparel it was driven really by kids and by babies. and in home, it was domestics and seasonal product. and then in kids, we had incredible season in toys with a double-digit comp. we really were pleased with the overall holiday. as we mentioned earlier in the call, wellness, home, apparel all comped in excess of the 3.8% we reported in the quarter. so strength across all those categories. and in order to win in the fourth quarter, you have to win in toys. well, our team won in toys, and showing a double-digit comp was critically important. so we felt very good about the early progress in those signature categories, and we'll build off of that momentum as we go in to 2015.
49;13;32;2;0.0625;i think brian hit on it earlier. we're continuing to drive for positive traffic. i think positive in the store and growing digital online, and that's part of our guidance.
49;14;128;0;0.0;yes, i think like we said, it was a little bit of deleveraging. there was some marketing expense we talked about in november, moved from november into -- or from q3 in to q4. as brian said, we made some investments in marketing. the other elements were ongoing all year. we had some technology. and then the thing that really drove a lot of it relative to the other quarters was incentive expense. we clearly out delivered our expectations, and that will be reflected in our incentive expense. thanks for joining us today. that's going to conclude our fourth-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. we appreciate everyone's participation today, and we really look forward to seeing you next week in new york city. so thank you again.
50;1;155;2;0.012903225806451613;oliver, , and thanks for joining us today. as we think about the balance of the year, i would ask you to think about three important variables and you saw those come to life in the first quarter. we're clearly focused on driving traffic to our stores and we expect that to be a very important driver of our growth over the balance of the year. but you're also seeing the benefit of our focus on signature categories and the higher ticket that that generates. but importantly the third element is the increasingly important contribution we're seeing from our digital and online businesses. so as we go forward, we're going to continue to make sure we're seeing growth in traffic, growth in our signature categories that leads to that gross margin rate improvement we saw in first quarter and the higher ticket, but importantly, the ongoing contribution of our online channel.
50;2;238;4;0.01680672268907563;oliver, you heard kathee talk about some of the key initiatives that came to life in the first quarter and you're going to continue to see us build off of that over the balance of the year. we've completely rebuilt our app. we're focused on improving our subscription and registry. we're leveraging our stores to shift to our guests. so we're going to continue to build on those initiatives as we go forward and continue to make sure that we're making the investments both in technology but importantly in the supply chain that brings that online business to light for our guests. and, oliver, if we can go back for a minute to your question on thinking about price versus innovation and how do we balance those. i would just say that we start from the guest, looking at what it is that they expect from any given product category and then how do we build the very best product? which is, depending on what it is, could be a combination of both price and innovation or more heavily leaning on one or the other, depending on what we're talking about. but very much guest focused to make sure that we're offering them the content that's going to inspire them and resonate. so there's not one size fits all. it's really guest-focused driven by each category.
50;3;5;0;0.0;oliver, thank you, appreciate it.
50;4;296;4;0.013513513513513514;let me start with the gross margin and the focus for not only the quarter but for many years to come. and we've been very clear about the importance of focusing in on our signature categories. we believe that's our path to differentiating the brand. so you should continue to expect us to focus on building our style categories. and kathee and her team are making great progress in apparel and home and beauty. and you saw the comps that those categories produced in the first quarter. we'll continue to focus on baby and kids and accelerate our focus on wellness. so we believe those categories both in store, but importantly as we demonstrated in q1 online, where a significant portion of our growth in the digital channel was driven by apparel and home. so that is a very favorable impact to mix, both in store and importantly as we improve and accelerate our online performance. the other thing i'd add, matt, is more tactically between q2 and q3, that's really last year where you saw us transition from focusing on significant promotions that were primarily hard lines or some of our lower margin categories' focus to the business, back to back-to-school and then into the holiday season. so as we think about the way q2 looks versus q3, where that promotional impact was real in q2 but it was also we had a significant mix impact because of where we focused those promotions. little bit less of that as we go into q3 and q4. so the delta between last year's margin and this year's margin will change meaningfully. and as kathee said, we continue to invest in price and quality across all of our brands.
50;5;61;1;0.01639344262295082;i think, matt, i would answer it broadly and say that what we see across all guests is when they become engaged in the digital channel, we see incremental growth in that channel and, importantly, incremental growth in the stores. so their total engagement with us is very incremental, we pick up incremental sales and importantly incremental profitability in both channels.
50;6;152;2;0.013157894736842105;yes, i would say that, scott, it's pretty early in our transformation to say that we see momentum in that measure as it pertains to food. i will tell you a lot of our growth in transactions is driven by new guests and that's driven more in the signature categories that we have been talking about. now we believe that we have an opportunity to drive traffic in food and that's why we're in the midst of putting a lot of tests out in front of our guests, both product and presentation, to get that business on track and to make sure that we've got a really compelling point of view for our guests. and then we will measure that over time to make sure that we're making progress. but today i would say it's more driven by the signature categories that we've highlighted.
50;7;101;2;0.019801980198019802;scott, it's certainly something that we're going to continue to monitor and measure over time. it's still very early for us, but that is a measure that we're clearly looking at. we absolutely want to make sure we're building loyalty. we want to build engagement and traffic. we believe our focus on signature categories brings guests back to target looking for what's new, what's exciting. and we also want to make sure we complement that with an improved food assortment because we know food is critically important to building engagement and driving overall traffic.
50;8;295;6;0.020338983050847456;i think as we would measure that and as we look at the guest feedback that we get, scott, i would say store execution is very high. guests are very satisfied with the number of people that we have, their ability to help them. i would say that we have an opportunity on the in-stock side and we've been working on that collectively, stores and merchandising, as we worked through the port situation and getting those back in stock. but also just our everyday basics. and it's one of the reasons why our inventory is elevated, as we've talked about, is that we have been making investments, particularly in essentials category to make sure that we can raise our inventory levels appropriate to be in-stock in those categories. so i think that's where we have the most opportunity right now. and, scott, that's reflected in the key initiatives we've been talking about. as we think about changes we're making in experience to elevate apparel with mannequins, to restructure our home layouts, to begin to make changes in electronics. we want to make sure we provide the guest with a great in-store experience particularly in those signature categories. but as kathee just noted, we also need to make sure we're focused on the basics every day. and we need to make sure we've got very high in-stock conditions, particularly in those key consumable categories. so for us, execution at store level is critically important. we believe we have the best team in retail and our focus now is on elevating the experience in those key signature areas of our store and ensuring that we're improving the in-stock conditions for basic essentials.
50;9;5;0;0.0;thanks, scott. appreciate the support.
50;10;154;2;0.012987012987012988;yes, so this is something that we aim to do all the time and of course right now we're comping against some pretty weak numbers post breach last year, so certainly that's part of it. as we focus on signature categories, i do think that's getting more new guests back into the brands and in a variety of different areas because signature categories cover so much from beauty to home, et cetera, to the different style categories. and i think the way that we're doing it is really what brian was just talking about, presentations that are really compelling with product that's very inspirational. and inviting them into the store through our marketing, which resonates with them. and then when they get to the store or online, being able to convert them to a purchase. so it's all of those things that i think are moving the needle.
50;11;281;6;0.021352313167259787;no, we've seen this coming for a little bit now. third quarter was the start of it, continued into fourth quarter and now again in our first quarter. but i think as we're improving quality, as we're stepping up our assortments to be more aspirational, we're seeing the guest really resonate with that product and move. and that's broad across virtually all of our categories. so not just in one segment of our business but really all of them. so i think it's driven by the guest perhaps having a bit more money in their pocket. i think it's the quality that we've put in, they're recognizing those benefits and they're wanting to be able to trade up. robbie, the one point i'd emphasize so that we're really clear, this is not an either/or, it's an and. so we want to make sure we're delivering exceptional value every day on those core essentials and continuing to bring great quality, newness, innovation and value to our guests as they look for these more aspirational items. so it's not a shift in strategy and it's not a either/or, it's an and. and we've got to make sure that both elements of our strategy include a focus on core essentials and more experiential offerings. and when we bring those together, that is the target brand promise and experience. that's where we bring expect more, pay less to life. so both of those elements are starting to work together and i think you're seeing the guests respond very positively to it. thank you.
50;12;133;1;0.007518796992481203;let me start with the regional performance trends, and we did not see any correlation between what you just referred to, changes in the oil and gas industry, and an influence on our comps. obviously, like everyone else, and this happens every single year, weather did impact regional performance. we had some challenging days in the northeast. we faced the same ice storms that others did in the southeast and in the texas market. but overall, we saw very consistent comp performance across signature categories. the growth kathee talked about was strong across the country in apparel and beauty and home. and we've seen very consistent performance trends and responses from our guests across the country. and to the minimum-wage question, no, we have not seen those types of impacts either.
50;13;150;3;0.02;it's a great question, robbie, and we're sorting through that. we wanted to get through annualizing past all of last year with the breach and the impact there. we're really pleased that we saw 110 basis points of penetration growth. we're seeing new accounts grow again, roughly split equally between credit and debit. i think as we learn a little bit more here as we get through this year, we'll figure out where we want to go. we still are very energized by redcard as a product offering. i think the opportunity for us is to tie that into a more holistic loyalty offering for our guests. we're testing some of that now out east, and you'll see us, as the year goes on, continue to test that, take those learnings and apply it more broadly to loyalty for our guests. thank you.
50;14;123;5;0.04065040650406504;yes, i think -- yes, you're right and all of that increase is really incentive expense offset by, again, some productivity improvements. i think as the year progresses, we'll continue to see improvements in sg&a. as we said throughout the year, as the year progresses, we'll continue to start to see the savings that we committed to, the $2 billion, $500 million of savings this year, about half in cogs, half in sg&a. in sg&a that will be offset somewhat by investments in technology. so we should continue getting past the noise SEMICOLON as the year progresses we'll continue to see leverage probably similar to what you saw in q1 as we get into q3 and q4.
50;15;187;4;0.0213903743315508;greg, in some ways you've answered the question for me. and we've been very clear in the fact that we're going to make $1 billion investment in technology and supply chain to enhance those capabilities, to improve our capabilities, to make sure we're partnering up technology with the ability to provide the product effectively through our supply chain. so the lilly event, while a sensational event for the brand, and we're really proud that we were able to create a black friday-type event in the month of april with hundreds and thousands of our guests lining up waiting for that product. but online, we know we had some missteps and we're doing a deep dive, we're looking at root causes, and it's going to provide important learning for us as we get ready for the traffic we expect to generate during the holiday season. but we are very committed to putting our capital behind improving technology capabilities and the supply chain requirements necessary to continue to grow that business at the accelerated rates we're delivering right now.
50;16;151;2;0.013245033112582781;well, this afternoon would be nice, but we are actively tearing apart the learning and clearly want to make sure that we have the diagnostics in place as soon as possible. and we're making the necessary adjustments and investments to enhance our overall digital experience. so this afternoon would not be soon enough and the team has an incredible sense of urgency to ensure that we have the right capabilities so that we're constantly meeting the needs of the guests. and, greg, i would just add that we're never done with that. so certainly we're learning from the lilly event and we will put that into play as soon as possible. but as we're growing at the rate that we are and we're introducing new code all the time, we are never done. so this is an ongoing effort probably until the end of time.
50;17;333;7;0.021021021021021023;yes, so made to matter has been a fantastic program for us, peter, as you know. we went from about 15 vendors last year and we increased that to about 30, 31 vendors this year, and we're seeing about 25% lift in sales. so the guest is really loving the product that we're offering. it's in a variety of categories. there's certainly food products, but there's beauty products, there's otc, there's baby. all of them, though, are really driven by simpler, better-for-you product, whether that's in food with cleaner labels and organic, or whether that's in baby, where it's cotton and more natural materials. but really great results and we marketed it most recently in the past month in what we call the rear seasonal area of our store where we brought all the products together for the first time and had really fantastic results. there was a marketing campaign that went along with that that really resonated with the guests and then the in-store presence helped make it easy for them to find when they came to the stores. peter, i think the great part of the program is it's just another point of validation that when we understand what the guest is looking for and we deliver the right curated assortment, they respond really well. you know that we have over 25 million guests visit our stores every week. we know that 98% of our guests purchase natural or organic products. thus we need to make sure we offer them the products and the selection they're looking for. it does not mean that conventional products do not play a very important role going forward, but our guest has voted. we understand the guest better than ever before. and kathee and her team are doing a sensational job of curating the right assortment and bringing the guests what they're looking for when they shop at target.
50;18;146;6;0.0410958904109589;i think that's a pretty good number. we're still evaluating the program. we launched the new vendors this spring, so we're still analyzing those results. but to brian's point, the guests will guide that work. the important part about made to matter is that while these brands might be carried elsewhere, we have exclusive product with meaningful innovation within the program within target, and that's what's really resonating with the guests. they recognize those brands are at target and they love to buy them. but they come looking for those new exclusive, really innovative products. so i think keeping the number at a reasonable amount so that we're sure that we can drive that right innovation, it's very much a partnership with us and these suppliers, so i think we're in the hunt with the right number.
50;19;398;6;0.01507537688442211;peter, kathee and i have been talking about this for several months now. we're using 2015 to test and learn. kathee's talked about key categories within food that we really think target should stand for and we're looking very closely at how we evolve assortment and how we merchandise those categories going forward. but this is not about how fast we make the changes. we want to make sure we really have a chance to test, learn, get the feedback from the guest, iterate. so then as we move into 2016 and beyond, we move forward with confidence. and with the confidence that the guest has guided us through the changes we're going to make. so we're clearly focused on it. the team is making very good progress. but we're in that test and learn and validate environment right now and you should expect to see much more unfold as we get into 2016. the thing that i would add is, as we're going through the testing, as brian mentioned, we're testing many different things, whether that's assortment changes that we're making, presentation changes that we're making, supply chain changes. part of our testing is to try to isolate those tests so that we can get a good read. so there's not going to be one place that you can go to look at what does the new food innovation look like. we've got it all over the place. and the other thing that i would add is you know that we just hired anne dament to run the senior vice president of grocery and we're very excited about that. she's been on board now for about a month and brings us 19 years of experience in grocery and cpg. so she certainly is learning and onboarding into target and bringing a wealth of knowledge from grocery, which will also impact what we put forth in terms of tests for the rest of the year. but i think you can look to 2016, as we learn and prove out what's working with the guests, what's resonating, we will start rolling those in 2016, but do not expect a big bang on january 1. to brian's point, this is really about getting it right and delighting the guest, not moving fast.
50;20;182;4;0.02197802197802198;so certainly shipping expense went up when we moved to $25, but i would tell you not a material impact on the quarter. and net, net, as we've said, as that brings more guests online, they shop our store and so a net positive, as far as we're concerned, across the lifetime value of those guests. i do not have the actual number of redcard holders that use free shipping on the site, but i can tell you the penetration of free shipping due to redcard on the site is very, very high. in general we have a very high percentage of our shipping that goes out free from the site. we talked about this last year when we shipped to free -- switched to free shipping during the holiday season, and i think that is why, going back to what brian said, the supply chain investments we make are incredibly important for our guests because they provide speed to market from their perspective. but they're incredibly important for us because they improve the economics of our online business meaningfully.
50;21;107;2;0.018691588785046728;a lot of that depends on the categories. i think the good part about licenses at target is that our guests respond to them very broadly, so it is not just a toy or a video game. for us, there's apparel involved, there's back-to-school products like backpacks and notebooks. so they have a pretty healthy margin mix, just given the breadth of category, and most of them fall into our signature categories. so we're very excited about the lineup of licenses and the fact that they start this summer and really go all fall. okay, we have time for one more question.
50;22;96;5;0.052083333333333336;it was mix is what came in better and i think we see that in two ways. first of all, there's just the mix of selling those products. and then when we see strength in home and apparel, of course our sell-throughs go up and so we have less markdowns. and so the positive benefits of mix go on and on. i'd only add, christopher, that again, we saw that mix benefit both in store and online, so the combination of those two channels working together clearly impacts and improves gross margin rate.
50;23;234;9;0.038461538461538464;that is certainly core to our strategy as we go forward. and i think what you saw, what we saw in q1, very solid performance. kathee and her team did a terrific job of curating the right products, particularly in those signature categories for our guest. despite some of the port challenges, our supply chain teams did an outstanding job of making sure we had inventory in place for the guests. i was very pleased with our marketing program, and if you have not seen the target style campaign or some of the things we just did for avengers, it's spectacular advertising and the guest is responding to it. and our store teams just did a phenomenal job throughout the quarter, despite port challenges and weather challenges of providing the guest with a good experience. and it added up to really solid results in q1. so we hope that continues. we're confident it's going to continue throughout the year. but we feel good about the progress, we know we've got a lot of work in front of us. but that combination of strong in-store and online growth in the first quarter gives us a lot of confidence that we're heading in the right direction. so, operator, that concludes our call today. i thank everybody for their participation and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. thanks.
51;1;272;14;0.051470588235294115;overall, i think we're making really good progress against our key strategic initiatives that we've been talking about for a year now. the change we announced this week is to make sure that we elevate our focus on execution and really ensuring operational excellence throughout the organization. and that's why i'm so excited about john stepping into this new role to make sure that we complement the focus we've placed upon creating strategic clarity with a recommitment to operational execution. and i think the combination of those two elements is critical to continuing to drive traffic, make sure we delight the guests, see an improvement in our net promoter scores, and make sure that both in-store and online, we're continuing to see an acceleration in traffic and visits to our site. so i think we're making very good progress right now. i think that is showing up in the results we delivered this quarter. but we're not satisfied. and we know we've got more work to do to ensure that we do meet the needs of the guests every time they shop. and critically important in meeting those needs is to make sure that we provide a great in-store experience and dramatically improve our in-stock conditions, particularly about core essentials. so i think very good progress. i think this is an excellent quarter where the entire team performed well. but we know we've got more work to do, and we've got to make sure both in-store and online, we deliver a consistently great experience for the guest.
51;2;400;7;0.0175;so on the comp guidance, we do not break out traffic and ticket. but i would tell you just from a business perspective, we are very focused on driving traffic over time. ultimately, we have to bring people into our stores. we need to bring people to the site, onto mobile devices. and so that's a key driver for us for our sales as we continue to move forward. related to the supply chain, there's -- the team has done a great job responding to the needs of the organization over time to develop more flexible ways to meet the needs of our guests and really fulfill on-demand shopping. i think we're just at a point now where we need to step back and build broader capabilities across the entirety of the supply chain as we continue to expand the way we want to serve our guests. so there is not one particular area of the company or one particular part of the business that we are completely focused on. [absent], i would tell you, as i said, and you heard from brian, in stocks are a key priority. and then specifically, being sure day to day in every store we're in stock on essentials. that's a key priority for our guests. we hear it from them. it's a key focus for the team, and we have teams working on improving those in stocks across our essential categories today. and that will be a focus as we go forward. oliver, i can build on that because as we talk about improving our focus on operational and executional initiatives, i go back to some conversations we've had in the past. i absolutely believe we have the best team in retail. our store operations -- tina and her team do a sensational job. but one of the things that john will be focused on is ensuring we simplify the work. and we make it much easier for them to execute each day and take care of the guest. so we want to complement a very strong store leadership team that does a sensational job each and every day, executing store by store, by simplifying some of the work, by making sure that we push work upstream, and allow them to focus even more on the store experience and the service we provide our guest. thank you.
51;3;131;8;0.061068702290076333;matt, i would tell you that the improvements we are seeing is really driven by mix. and as we've talked about, we've invested heavily in ensuring we're on trend SEMICOLON we're bringing great quality to the guest SEMICOLON we're accentuating our position in key categories. we were really pleased during the quarter to see how well be connected with sub cats like swim. we've seen really strong performance in ready-to-wear, and most recently, a very positive response to the changes we've made in denim. so the improvements we are seeing in those categories are really driven by great quality, following the trend curves, bringing great style, and fashion to our guest. and it has not been driven by a reliance on pricing.
51;4;97;5;0.05154639175257732;no. matt, we're in a place where we have, we believe, just great, great assets across the supply chain. great distribution centers, great upstream distribution centers, food distribution centers, fulfillment centers, and, of course, the stores. i think we've said over the past couple of years, our focus of our investment has been supply chain and technology in support of becoming an on-demand company. that will continue to be the case. we're going to continue to invest in technology and supply chain. but the physical asset side, we feel really, really good about.
51;5;24;1;0.041666666666666664;it is. and it would be. and we are seeing a very positive start to back-to-school and back-to-college. thanks, matt.
51;6;1;0;0.0;morning.
51;7;552;4;0.007246376811594203;sure. let me start with localization. and as i said, during the last couple of calls, this is still a very nascent effort for us. we're in one market, a handful of stores in chicago. but we've really been focusing on a handful of areas where we recognize we need to change our assortment, change our presentation, be more relevant, and really recognize the needs and the demographics of these local markets. so there's a handful of categories i might lift up. one, craft beer. and really making sure that in a category like craft beer, we have locally relevant items. and we recognize that even in a market like chicago, those need to be tailored neighborhood by neighborhood. so we've looked at specialty foods SEMICOLON we've looked at categories like craft beer. we've looked at categories like patio and grills. and recognizing that in the suburbs of chicago, we can offer, and should have in store, large patio sets, five-burner grills. but for our stores located in more of the urban neighborhoods, of chicago, we need bistro tables. and we need two-burner grills, because those guests are living in condos and apartments. they've got small patios, and we need to make sure we tailor our assortment and our presentation to recognize their needs and to make sure we're mode locally relevant. so we're certainly spending a lot of time looking at food. and as we think about the food reinvention, a lot of this is going to be driven by making sure we have locally relevant brands, those hometown favorites. and also in broader categories, like patio and furniture, making sure that we're matching up our assortment in-store with the needs of that local guest. so a lot of additional work for us to do, but we're really pleased with the progress. and i talked about a 1 to 2 point lift versus the test and control stores. that is a very important measure for us to continue to evaluate. and working with john and our merch team, we'll be looking to rapidly rollout the learning from chicago into other relevant markets. from a digital standpoint, david, obviously, we continue to see really positive responses in some of our efforts like cartwheel. and cartwheel has now been downloaded over 18 million times. and every time i'm in stores, i run into guests that have their smartphone in their hand and they are looking for their offers from cartwheel. but we also recognize that target is a brand that's talked about in social media, every day, thousands of times every day. so if you were to visit our headquarters here in minneapolis, just down the hall from my office, we have what we call guest central. it's our guest command center where we're monitoring what people are talking about, what they are blogging about, how target's being referenced in the news. and we're making sure we're very engaged with those bloggers and making sure that we are in the discussion. so it's a very important part of how we think about the brand and making sure that we incorporate social into our overall brand development initiatives. thank you, david.
51;8;369;14;0.037940379403794036;well, i think it starts, scott, with the reaction we've seen from the guests to some of the changes we've made in signature categories. when i think about, in today's marketplace, apparel growing at 4% to 5% SEMICOLON the changes we've seen and the reaction we've seen from the guests to our home offering SEMICOLON the fact that within kids, toys growing this quarter at 12%. and while, again, still in the early stages, the reaction to some of the changes we are making in our food assortment SEMICOLON the reaction the guest is taking to made to matter SEMICOLON our wellness initiatives, gives me a tremendous amount of confidence that as we continue to bring great design, fashion, quality, and excitement to our signature categories, and combine that with the opportunity to reinvent food, to bring the right assortment that meets the needs of our guests. that to me is the magic to unlock sustainable sales growth at target and make sure we're driving traffic to our stores, more visits to our site. and it gets back fundamentally, scott, i believe we win. and we'll continue to grow by combining a great story experience, the convenience of allowing our guests to order online and pick up in our stores whenever they want, and also being able to ship directly to their homes and using our stores as flexible fulfillment centers to make sure that response is a quick one. so i'm very optimistic about the future. i think you are starting to see that embedded in the results, and the results in signature categories is very encouraging for us. we're getting great feedback from the guests. as i think about the third quarter, we expect plaid to be a really exciting initiative, and the buzz that we are seeing already is really positive. so we've got work to do on food. but when we reinvent food and get the assortment right there and improve the presentation, i think that gives us all great confidence that we're going to continue to drive traffic to our stores. and that's going to convert to really solid and sustainable comps.
51;9;373;11;0.029490616621983913;i think we can all drive ourselves crazy doing two-year, three-year, five-year stacks whatever you want. but in this case, i do think the two-year stack is important. we've continued to see our two-year stacks improve. if you do last year's q4 against the previous q4, the average there is about -- or the number there is about a [1/3]. so we expect to cycle path that this q4. and we've seen putting our -- putting the applied guidance -- you guys can do a rough number around that. putting that against last year's comp will be in acceleration of our two-year stack. and so we feel good about that. and i think to the points brian just made, part of it is we need to continue to grow. we feel confident we're going to continue to grow and comp against whatever it is we delivered in the prior year, and we feel good about doing that. we feel great about our fourth-quarter plans. we're cognizant that that's an intensely competitive time of year. we'll be very promotional. we're not going to get beat on promotions, and we'll be in the game. and we feel really good about what we'll offer the guests in q4. yes. and scott, obviously, we'll update our guidance for the fourth quarter at a later date. but trust me, we are spending a tremendous amount of time evaluating our plans week by week in the fourth quarter. i spent time just yesterday with our team, going through our fourth-quarter plans, our merchandising plans, our marketing plans, how we're going to approach the key holiday periods. and, to me, it's all about making sure we've got the right content. we've got to have great product. we certainly know we need to make sure we're winning from a promotional standpoint. but then we've got to make sure we surround the guest with a great experience and really iconic marketing. and i think we're going to combine a great in-store with an online experience and be very competitive and well-prepared for the fourth quarter.
51;10;2;0;0.0;thanks, scott.
51;11;152;5;0.03289473684210526;so matt, i'm not going to go through the details of our plans. we'll kind of maintain that powder for the fourth quarter. but we are certainly looking at newness in electronics. we're looking at categories where we think we are uniquely positioned to win. so working very closely with our suppliers, to ensure that we have the right newness, that we're ready with the right presentation. i think there's a lot of exciting things in the pipeline. we certainly think, as we continue to focus on wellness, that wearable technology is a space where we can and will win. but we also recognize right now that many of those categories are waiting for new innovation. and we're working closely with our key suppliers to make sure that we are going to be bringing that innovation to the guest and featuring it throughout the fourth quarter.
51;12;368;8;0.021739130434782608;i'll take the second one first, and then let brian comment on the growth. i think on our supply chain for the digital channel, we actually have six dedicated fulfillment centers. and we think the combination of fulfillment centers with our existing regional distribution centers, and along with the stores, gives us all the capability we need. and then you'll see us continue to grow the store channel, our regional distribution channel, all three of those channels, as ways to fulfill, depending on the product and how quickly the guest wants it. yes. and peter, i'll step back and just talk about some of the fundamentals. we've got to continue to make sure we build awareness. we've got to make sure that as our guest engages with us digitally, we make it really easy. we make it easy to find product, an easy checkout experience. we believe that available-to-promise, which will roll out this fall, will give our guest the confidence that they know where the product is and when it will arrive for them. either in a store for them to pick up or being available directly to their home. so we are focused on making sure that we provide, not only a great in-store, but a great digital experience. and we've got to make sure that we continue to make our site easy to work with. and more and more that's the mobile interchange that we've got to make sure is easy for our guest to find product and check out. we want to give them the confidence that when they order, they know it's available to promise. and we're going to have it there for them when they need it. and to the point john made, we do not need to be building upstream dcs. we're going to continue to convert more of our stores and as we go into the fourth quarter, close to 450. that will act as flexible fulfillment centers to make sure that we can quickly and efficiently get product to the guest. so those fundamentals are critically important as we think about driving industry-leading growth.
51;13;279;4;0.014336917562724014;yes. so we're right on track with savings. we've got programs identified to deliver the entirety of the [$2 billion], the $1.5 billion in sg&a, plus the cost of goods savings. so we feel really good about that. we're on track for our commitment this year as well. one of the things we talked about when we first announced this, and we've talked about it in a great detail in the company, is the stores are already productive. and if we're going to take hours out of the store, it will be because we eliminate work, or to the point brian made earlier, move work upstream into the distribution centers. and so we're not focused on taking hours out of the store. we are focused on taking work out and we have not -- we're in the process of working through that. that's a little bit longer lead process than some of the other things we've done. but we are very focused on, essentially, freeing up those hours in the store. and then we'll decide, do we need them for improved guest service or how we'll utilize them. but in fact, there's a couple areas where we have invested hours back into the store. as we put in the whole merchandising sets and as we put in manikins, we've realized the need for dedicated store team members who can merchandise those displays and make them look great all the time. so that's an area where we've invested back into the store. thanks. all right, we have time for one more question this morning.
51;14;217;5;0.02304147465437788;yes. good questions. on the credit side, the benefit, it was up, but not meaningful. and it was less than, i'd say, less than half a penny of improvement versus last year. so very, very small. we are pleased it was up given that the, as we said, payment rates continue to go up. and so we're seeing the portfolio continue to shrink. so clearly, a portion of where the gas dollars are going, at least from our perspective. sg&a through time, we'd expect to lever sg&a, go up, over the long term here, go up modestly, slower than sales growth. i think we've said we're going to continue to take expense out. but we also said that the majority of that expense will likely get reinvested. so i would not count on big reductions in our sg&a over time. there will be places where we have to add back expense to meet the needs of our guests i just talked about in the stores. so modestly slower than sales growth over the long term would be what i'd say. well, great. thank you. and for all of you, that concludes our second-quarter earnings conference call. and i really appreciate you joining us today, so thank you.
52;1;148;6;0.04054054054054054;well, matt, i would tell you, we're feeling really good about the trends we're seeing, the reaction we're getting from the guests, certainly the growth in traffic for us is really encouraging. so we're seeing more target guests come back to our stores and visit our sites. and they're continuing to respond very positively to the work we've done in signature categories. so sitting here today, we're very confident about our position. we think we're connecting with the consumer and our guest, and i feel fantastic about the plans we have in place for the fourth quarter. so while obviously still cautious, as we sit here early in november, we feel very good about the way the consumer and the guest is responding to our brand. and i feel as if we're really well-positioned for the fourth quarter.
52;2;229;5;0.021834061135371178;let me talk about the owned brand investments we're making and then let cathy talk through the rx implications. as we've consistently talked about throughout the last year and year-and-a-half now, we think one of the things that differentiates target is the value, the quality, the innovation we bring to our own brands. so we're clearly looking to make sure we bring more value to our own brands. i talked about the number of handcrafted items we're going to have for the fourth quarter. and we're being very surgical with those investments, but we're seeing a great reaction from the guest as we elevate the value we offer in our own brands. so we'll be very surgical, very selective, but we're certainly seeing a great return for the investments we're making. and matt, , this is cathy. with regards to the pharmacy reimbursement pressure, as we said when we announced the transaction with cvs, that we lack scale and we knew that we were going to continue to see pressure here over time. so what we're seeing in this quarter is in the range of 15 to 20 basis points of pressure in the quarter. and -- which is why we're excited to be partnering with cvs, because they'll be able to help with that scale.
52;3;124;3;0.024193548387096774;right now we're still very focused on testing localization in chicago. we are very pleased with the results. and certainly a lot of localization is taking place in our food and beverage offerings. we're seeing the guests respond to that, and we're going to take the learning from chicago and apply it to the 25 stores we're remodeling in los angeles. so we'll continue to expand the learning, take it from chicago to la, but i am very pleased with the progress we're making. and we're partnering with john and the store and supply chain teams to make sure over time we can scale the learning from chicago and los angeles to multiple markets around the country.
52;4;8;0;0.0;we are consistently seeing those kinds of returns.
52;5;265;2;0.007547169811320755;i think the most important measure to look at is what's happening with online growth overall. and just in the last 24 months -- or 24 hours we saw the october e-commerce growth rates in the us, and it was up about 8.6%. the outlook that nrf has for e-commerce growth in the fourth quarter is somewhere between 6% and 8%. so while our 20% growth rate is not in line with our expectations, it's still dramatically outperforming the industry. and i think the most important measure we're looking at is the fact that over 80% of our guests start their shopping journey online, either at home on their desktop or with a mobile device. and that digitally influenced guest is coming into our stores more often. so as we've talked about our strategy, our strategy is to make sure we allow our guests to shop anywhere anytime they want with target. and what we're seeing right now is they're voting with their feet to spend more time in our stores. they're downloading our cartwheel app: 20 million downloads so far to date. so i think we're seeing an overall slowdown in digital growth across retail. and we're really pleased that we continue to outpace the industry -- dramatically outpace the industry, but our digital efforts are driving more traffic into our stores and helping us grow our overall comps. so while there's been a slowdown broadly across the sector, we continue to outpace the industry, and that's our fundamental goal. thank you.
52;6;298;8;0.026845637583892617;i think we're making some very good strides starting in apparel. and while 3% in q3 was slightly less than the growth rate we saw in the second quarter, compared to many of our peers we recognize that we're continuing to build traffic and growth in an important apparel category. so the work we've done with mannequins, with changing the in-store experience, clearly paying off. one of the changes that we've announced recently is the addition of 1,400 visual merchandiser's to make sure we combine the changes we're making with mannequins, and fixtures, and layouts with experts in store that can maintain that great in-store merchandising experience. so that's a new venture for us, we're standing it up for the holidays, we expect that to continue to strengthen the in-store experience, and we know with our signature categories we're still at the very, very early stages of standing up our wellness position. but we feel like we're in an excellent position with baby and kids, feel very good about our performance in the third quarter with kids apparel. certainly toys has been a highlight throughout the year, and we feel as if we're well-positioned coming off of second and third quarter comps in toys that were up 12%. the reaction we've seen from the guests to our star wars assortment, where we've captured an industry-leading position and expect to be a destination during the holidays. so while we still have much more work to do, we feel very good about the progress we're making in signature categories. and i think the addition of visual merchandiser's in store will help us maintain our merchandising appeal throughout the holidays.
52;7;289;4;0.01384083044982699;scott, i'm glad you asked the question. i do think one of our highlights in q3 was the improved performance in food. we've actually seen food comp acceleration throughout the year. and while we have not made major changes with fixtures and in-store decor, we've been very focused on assortment changes and bringing more natural, organic, local items into many of our categories. and we're seeing the guests react very favorably. so, to me it's getting the basics right. and before we start making fixture changes and decor changes, it has to start with the right assortment and making sure we have the items, the brands, our guest is looking for when they shop food at target. so the acceleration you're seeing right now is driven by section by section getting the assortment right, bringing more appealing items to our guests, adding more natural, organic, gluten-free items that are on trend to those categories. we made some significant changes in yogurt in the third quarter and saw very, very positive responses SEMICOLON high single-digit growth rates in those categories. so while we are not shouting about it, we're making steady progress in food. we'll learn a lot more in 25 stores in los angeles where you will see some changes in fixtures and decor. and as we learn, we'll continue to grow. so i think we do have significant upside, but scott, this is about making sure we get it right, and we're going to take a slow, steady approach, solid, consistent results every quarter. and continue to deliver what the guest is looking for from an assortment experience standpoint when they shop food at target.
52;8;217;7;0.03225806451612903;yes. scott, we've looked at this very carefully. i know we've talked about it a number of times. we feel very confident that the capex budgets we've had in place will be very adequate over time to make the changes we need to make from a technology standpoint, a supply-chain standpoint, continue to refresh our stores, and maintain our focus on maintenance investments. so sitting here, cathy and i have spent a lot of time recently, obviously john's been a great steward of our capex spending. and we feel very comfortable that our current spending levels will allow us to modernize the organization, enhance technology, improve supply chain, and make sure along the way we're continuing to enhance the in-store experience and match that up with a great online experience for our guests. i would offer just real quickly to add to that, because we have pressure tested this one ourselves a lot, we have not -- target has not under-invested over the years. and i think that bodes well with the state of where you find our stores as well as our technology and supply chain investments we need. so i feel very good about where we are, and with that level of investment we've been pretty consistent.
52;9;193;2;0.010362694300518135;so i'll jump in and take that. i think from a tracking perspective, what we said, your point, $1.5 billion of sg&a, $0.5 billion of margin, and we would deliver in 2015 about $0.5 billion of that. we're running a little bit ahead of that pace. and both in the cost of goods and in the sg&a space, both are running perhaps a little bit ahead of what we envisioned going into the year. so we feel really good about that. i think stepping back and tying this back to scott's question, the other thing we said at the time was we're taking $2 billion out of the p&l but we did not expect ebitda margin expansion. and our view was that we would need this to fuel the investments, exactly some of the expense investments that perhaps scott was referring to, and this would provide the capacity to do that. and that is in fact what we've seen. we've seen great expense discipline across the corporation, but where we needed to invest, we have had the capacity to do that.
52;10;27;0;0.0;we will take out $600 million this year. and then part of next year's will be annualization of that, and part of it will be incremental.
52;11;80;4;0.05;we do not see any material change in the marketplace. again, we've talked a lot in the past about making sure we're investing to have the best retail team. and we look at this very surgically year after year, market by market, we think we're in a great position and we think we're hiring terrific talent. and we're excited that we've got a great team in place as we get ready for the holidays.
52;12;316;6;0.0189873417721519;greg, this is cathy. i'll take the first part of it. to answer your question, yes, we expect it to be essentially flat and it will be pretty much offset. we'll have pluses and minuses, so the savings we're getting we will continue to reinvest as we had planned. john will answer the 40% digital shipment. sure, greg. 40% this quarter, and it will peak a little bit higher than that actually, typically running in more in the 20% to 25% range. but as we peak, this is a great way for us to utilize our store assets. the labor model, what happens here is actually it's quite efficient because we have dedicated teams in those stores who do the picking, do the packing, i mean we're just able to utilize them more efficiently. and so while there is more store labor that we are using, the offset clearly comes in our shipping expense, because we're much closer to the guest we are shipping to and they are not on the same p&l line, but it's an outstanding trait for us. greg, i think it's important as you tie out the math on the ship from store. last year at this time we had just over 120 stores where we were shipping from store. as we sit here today, we're up to 462. so we've expanded the base. we're going to leverage and sweat the assets i think much more effectively. but importantly, that enhanced base allows us to deliver to our guests in a much shorter timeframe. so we would expect that to grow during the holidays. we've certainly ramped up for it. and we think that's going to provide a much better shopping experience and allow us to deliver product to our guests in a much shorter period of time.
52;13;126;0;0.0;i'll answer briefly and then anyone can chime in. we're really not seeing an impact on it, in our product cost or in -- obviously in our margins. so it's really been kind of a non-event for us. remember, greg, with many of those items, those are long lead time items. so we'll certainly be watching that over time, but as we sit here today many of those orders and pos were placed many, many months ago. so we'll continue to monitor that over time, but we certainly like our position with our own brands as we enter the holidays, and that's an important way that we differentiate. operator, it looks like we've got time for one more call.
52;14;169;2;0.011834319526627219;bob, first on the a&a side, again, we think the guest is responding really well to some of the changes we've made with our own brand assortment. and the investments that we talked about today we've been consistently talking about for over a year now. making sure that we're reinvesting in quality and innovation, in style, making sure that we deliver that expect more pay less brand promise. so the guest is reacting really, really well to that. and we're going to continue to make sure that we deliver great value in our own brands. so it should not be a new phenomenon. it's something that we've been very clear and transparent about. and we think it's paying off with increased traffic and growth in those core signature categories. so looks like we've run out of time for today. i do appreciate everyone calling in. and that will conclude our third-quarter earnings call. so thanks, everyone, for joining us.
53;1;3;0;0.0;we can now.
53;2;312;8;0.02564102564102564;well, it's still very early and we'll be tracking this carefully over the next few months. john mulligan was actually down in the charlotte market just a few weeks ago, where we've rebranded some of the very first cvs pharmacies inside of target. so john, why do not i let you share some of your impressions? yes, i think overall, i do not think the rebranding will be a significant disruption for the store or the technology changes that are going to go on. as we walk the store, it looked fantastic. the cvs brand looks great. i think they've done a great job, between our team and theirs, tying it into the total target store environment. when we did this, we spoke a lot about the tools that cvs would bring, not only to our guests, but to our teams. the teams were certainly excited about the tools that cvs is bringing to them to help them do their job, so that they can focus more fully on guest service. so we're very excited about that. and we're excited to see, like brian said, as we go along later in the year, we'll see more marketing to talk about the relationship of the two companies and also see the reaction of our guests as those capabilities are made more front and center for them, as well. i'd only add, we've been working for months and months now with our colleagues at cvs to make sure this is a very smooth transition. and the plans we have in place will minimize the impact on the guest. so we're very excited about what this brings to target, what it brings to our guests, and to our shareholders, and expect it to be a very seamless transition over the next six months. thank you.
53;3;370;9;0.024324324324324326;why do not i start by talking about the promotional environment? and we approach every year recognizing that the fourth quarter, this holiday season, is a very important time of the year for us, and it's going to be a very promotional environment. and as we sit here today, we really believe our playbook that we rolled out during the holiday drove traffic to our stores, drove traffic to our site, allowed us to accelerate our comp performance. and remember, we were comping a very strong q4 from 2014. so we felt very good about the effectiveness of our promotions. they were broad, they were very simple, and they worked both in store and online. so we feel great about the performance during the holiday, where our signature categories performed well. we've worked with nielsen and npd to look at market share performance and clearly recognize that we gained market share as a by-product of our playbook in the fourth quarter. so feel very good about our approach. but to your question about the future, we're always stepping back and analyzing promotional effectiveness, looking back at our playbook. and as we plan for next year, we'll continue to enhance and refine and make sure that we have very broad, very simple and very effective offers that continue to drive traffic and profitably grow our sales. john, do you want to talk about the impact of in-stocks? yes, i think we certainly can analyze, triangulate around the sales impact of in-stocks, but that would be providing you very rough estimates. what i think is much more important when you talk about essential categories, ultimately this is about the guests trusting that you will have the merchandise they want when they come in our stores. if a new mom takes her baby out in 10-degree weather for diapers and formula, you better have diapers and formula in your store. and so really, it's about the trust that they have in the target brand to always deliver wherever and whenever they want. and over time, there is no doubt in our minds that will drive sales growth for the long term. thank you, michael.
53;4;0;0;NA; .
53;5;371;11;0.029649595687331536;i'll start out, and then i'll let cathy and john also build on it. but as we talked about last year, we've had a very clear multi-year plan. we targeted over $2 billion of savings. and in 2015, we've made very good progress against that plan. we're on or ahead of all of the key metrics that we're tracking and we expect that to continue as we go forward. so john and cathy are working across the organization to make sure that those initiatives stay in place. and as john continues to build his team and we bring people like [anu] gupta on board to focus on operational excellence, we expect to find even greater opportunities for further improvement. so i think we're well positioned today. i feel very good about the progress we've made to drive productivity across the organization, and you should expect that to continue in 2016 and beyond. i'll just add on a little bit. with regards to our performance with sg&a, the beauty of what we're seeing with the plan we laid out last year is we're delivering upon it, but we're also recognizing how we can reinvest back in the business on the priorities that matter to our guests. and so if you think about our investment in visual merchandise leaders, that's a great example. 1,400 stores now have someone who is an expert at helping to showcase the categories that matter most to our guests. and so we're seeing ability, as we save on one line, we can invest in other areas in our business. and you had asked about wage pressure. i'm going to just put a plug in. we believe in having the best team in retail. and that has always been a differentiator for target, and we believe more today than ever that is going to be a differentiator is our wonderful team member engagement with our guests every single day, any way they interact with them. so we're going to be competitive in wage. we always assess it market by market, because we believe in fielding that best team in retail.
53;6;125;0;0.0;yes. so greg, thank you. first off, i'm going to put a plug in to say we look forward to seeing you next week, because we'll obviously unpack a little bit more of it then. but with regards to the share repurchase comment, in our guidance we did assume a consistent level of share repurchases, like we've been talking. however, we're also ending the year with a pretty heavy cash position, because we closed the transaction late in december. and so you'll see us provide additional color into that. but suffice it to say, it will be at the level of this year or higher, and we've included that in our eps guidance of $5.20 to $5.40.
53;7;29;0;0.0;yes, so as we've said, it obviously was an impact on sales, but very little on the aggregate ebitda line, which is what we've said longer term.
53;8;3;0;0.0;yes. thanks, greg.
53;9;153;4;0.026143790849673203;sean, as we think about our performance in the fourth quarter, it played out pretty much as expected. we know the fourth quarter is going to be very promotional, very competitive. we certainly saw the guests respond very positively to our offers and that drove great traffic. it allowed us to build market share in our signature categories, and i think it positioned us well for 2016. so as we sit here, there's a lot of variables that go into building our plans for a quarter like the fourth quarter, but we're very pleased with the way our plans drove traffic to our stores, visits to our site, allowed us to accelerate comps on top of a very strong quarter last year. and we saw very broad increases across many of our signature categories, as we reported. so i think our plans were in line with our expectation for the quarter.
53;10;129;4;0.031007751937984496;sean, again, a number of puts and takes as we look at the impact of changes in currency and cost of goods, but it's all baked into our outlook for next year. and i think we approach 2016 with a lot of confidence that we've got great plans in place, terrific momentum. and as you'll see next week at the conference, the team's done a terrific job in building some exciting new brands that we'll showcase next week and we're already seeing some really positive responses from our guests to our new kids line, pillow fort. so we're excited about 2016 and we look forward to seeing you next week. with that, operator, we've got time for one last call today.
53;11;309;12;0.038834951456310676;we're going to spend a lot more time unpacking this next week, but we recognize that today, our target guests interfaces with the brand in a number of different ways. sometimes they are in our stores, sometimes they're shopping online. we certainly heard many times, because of some of the proprietary items that we offered during the fourth quarter, they were shopping online, but as john referenced, quickly coming to our stores to pick up those items. so we felt really good about the way the guests responded to our offers during the fourth quarter. and a great combination of in-store traffic, more guests than ever before clicking and collecting items in our store, and then the fact that we were able to leverage our stores, this year over 460, where we were shipping from stores to our guests' homes, that overall package came together really effectively throughout the holiday. so we feel as if we had a winning strategy in the holidays. it drove great comps on top of a very strong performance last year. and you and many of the others that are on the call have asked me repeatedly throughout 2015, would we be able to comp the 3.8% increase in 2014? well, hopefully, we answered that question. we answered it with strong momentum, and we were able to see both strong performance in our stores and we delivered industry leading performance online. so we feel really good about the way we're exiting q4 and well positioned for 2016 and beyond. so we're looking forward to seeing all of you next week in new york and thanks for your patience this morning. i know we started a few minutes late, but hopefully it was worth your time, and we look forward to seeing you again next wednesday. so thank you.
54;1;384;5;0.013020833333333334;hey, greg. i'll start. we did see -- obviously, we had a very strong february and march, and felt really great around our performance in easter. we saw that we took share in apparel in easter and so we were really good there. but we did see a slowdown in april. a lot of it, though, is that ad shift that we were seeing. so that's part of what we're seeing with regard to april. but we did see slowdowns throughout the course of april. greg, let me provide some color as far as the geographic volatility, and i'm going to be really transparent with some of the examples. as we looked at business in april, and again in the start of may, we've seen a significant performance difference between our west coast markets and, particularly, our northeast markets. and significant variability, where we've seen some very positive growth performance across our entire portfolio -- in los angeles, in san francisco, and many of our core west coast markets -- offset by significant slowness in the northeast -- in boston, in new york, in philadelphia, in dc. in given categories, we've seen dramatic performance differences. in the ready-to-wear category, on the west coast and in parts of the midwest, where we've seen an earlier spring, we're seeing double-digit growth in ready-to-wear, offset by fairly significant declines in the northeast. we had a review with our team yesterday. we looked at categories like fans. we have markets that are up 20% and markets that are down 90%, so we're seeing volatility driven by, certainly, climate, but i think a number of other factors that we're certainly analyzing. cathy talked about an earlier easter. we've certainly looked at weather patterns. we recognize that, year on year, fuel prices have increased. and our guests and the consumer is spending more than they did a year ago at the pump. and we certainly recognize that within overall categories, today's consumer, our guest, is reinvesting in their homes. they're spending money on home improvement. we've seen that in our home category, which was up 4% in the first quarter. so, a lot of volatility, and it's both geographic and within category mixes.
54;2;31;0;0.0;greg, i'm really sorry but you literally cut out right when you said what you were trying to ask about ebit margins. so, i'm sorry, can you please repeat?
54;3;79;0;0.0;we did talk about gross margin. we expect gross margin to be 40 basis points at the midpoint. and we still expect a promotional environment, and we're planning for that. again, greg, i think, under the circumstances, as we've looked at our competitors' reports, we recognize there's significant inventory in the marketplace. we expect the second quarter to continue to be very promotional, and that's factored into our guidance for the second quarter. thanks, greg.
54;4;321;5;0.01557632398753894;oliver, let me address the trips. and we talked about, in the prepared comments, we continue to see very strong performance in what we'll describe as that stock-up trip, where, as a company, we performed very well throughout 2015 and again in the first quarter of 2016. where we have seen some trip erosion is with the guest who is coming in for that fill-in trip. so, as we think about actions we're taking in our business right now, we want to continue to make sure we're serving the guest who's looking for that stock-up item, that stock-up trip. and we're going to be even more focused as we manage through the quarter and the balance of the year to make sure we're winning and driving more fill-in trips. you'll see us enhance and change both our promotional calendar, our in-store presentation of more fill-in items to make sure that we're doing both -- continuing to win with the guest who's shopping target for that stock-up occasion, but also making sure we're capturing more of that fill-in trip throughout the quarter. so those are actions that we're taking right now. the team's working on making adjustments in our promotional cadence and presentation to make sure that we're doing both. we're continuing to win with the stock-up shopper, but we're also capturing more share of wallet with that fill-in guest. from a promotional standpoint, we would expect to see most of the intensity in the apparel space, where we certainly recognize that many of our competitors are sitting on high levels of inventory. we've got to be prepared for continued promotional intensity in that space. and i think we're well positioned, as both cathy and john have noted, to manage through that throughout the quarter.
54;5;254;7;0.027559055118110236;well, i think, oliver, the one thing that we continue to see, and we've embraced as an organization, is whether our guest is shopping in-store or online, it starts digitally. so we continue to make sure we're investing in our digital assets to make sure we're providing the ease and convenience for our guests, whether they're in-store or shopping online. it's why we've made such a commitment, as john talked about, to enhancing our order online, pick up in-store capabilities. it's why we've elevated our focus on making sure that we provide an easy shopping experience for our guest online. we continue to build out those capabilities. so, we recognize that, even as we look at the start of 2016, the majority of the retail business in the united states continues to be done in stores, but it starts online. so we better have great digital capabilities to make sure, when our guest is shopping target -- no matter how they shop -- we make it a convenient, easy experience. so that has not changed dramatically. and one of the numbers that we feel best about in the first quarter is the fact that, on top of a very strong 38% growth in the first quarter of 2015, we grew our digital sales by 23%. so we're continuing to connect with that guest that wants to shop target online, and we'll continue to invest and build our capabilities in that space. thank you.
54;6;221;3;0.013574660633484163;joe, in some ways, you're looking inside of our current play-book. and, certainly, as we think about winning more trips with that fill-in guest, cartwheel plays an incredibly important role. and we'll continue to make sure that we activate cartwheel to drive those trips and meet that guest's need. one of the things that we're certainly recognizing, as we look at 2016 shopping patterns, is there is a consumer and a guest who continues to look for value. and that value is expressed in more fill-in trips, buying smaller packs, smaller baskets. so, again, it's not a shift in our strategy SEMICOLON it's a recognition that we have to do both. we have to continue to delight the guests when they come to target for that big stock-up occasion, and we have to have the right assortment, the right value, the right presentation for that guest who's coming to us for the fill-in trip. so, cartwheel plays a very important role in that. and, as we think about adjustments and modifications we're making to our plans, cartwheel plays a very important role in driving more trips back to our stores and certainly meeting the needs of our guest who's coming to us for that fill-in occasion.
54;7;194;2;0.010309278350515464;joe, it was a significant disruption. you know our stores. you know the layout. and for all of our center store dry grocery items, we moved every one of those aisles in all of our stores. so, significant disruption for the guest. short term, it certainly has an impact on our performance in grocery and food. but, as we've made the changes, the response we're seeing from the guest is very encouraging. they're recognizing the new assortment, the new brands, more local items, the fact that we have more organic and gluten-free items on our shelves. and, in many of these categories -- like the significant change we made in bars -- we're seeing very strong sales results coming out of the reset. so, it was an investment we had to make, in both labor and in disruption, to make sure we continue to move forward in the reinvention of food. so, short term, it had a meaningful impact on our food sales. but we certainly expect to see the recovery over the balance of this year as we provide a more relevant assortment to our target grocery shopper. thank you.
54;8;226;6;0.02654867256637168;we were as promotional as necessary. we drove, as we shared, a 4% comp in our signature categories, which are the areas that tend to be more promotional. so we feel very good about our promotional cadence. continue to work on being more and more effective, but still have a long way to go there. so i would not say that we saved any on promotions, in particular. we were as promotional as we thought was appropriate and it showed up in our comp. chris, i'd only add that, as we look at individual category performance, we felt like we were very competitive in categories like apparel, where, as we look at the npd data, we look at the market-share results, we were one of the big market-share winners in the first quarter. and, clearly, in apparel, we picked up market share the two weeks leading up to easter, during the easter week, and the week following. so, our assortment, our presentation, our promotions certainly connected with the guest. and, in important signature categories, we continue to advance market share. but we feel particularly good, in a tough apparel environment, that we posted positive comps, we grew market share, and, importantly, we grew market share before, during, and after the important easter holiday, which is a critically important holiday for the apparel category.
54;9;121;0;0.0;well, on the in-stock question, i think it's hard to parse that out, a very difficult question to answer. certainly we have some estimates internally, but it gets into trading behavior, as you know, and how guests will trade out. but, overall, i think the in-stock definitely having it there when the guest wants it. but, more important than that, is ensuring that they trust us, that no matter when they come in the store, we'll have what they want. and that's about building trust for the brand over the long term. and so there is an immediate impact, but this is much more about being sure we're reliable all the time for the guest.
54;10;50;0;0.0;you know what, i thought i had said gross margin. i meant 40 basis points on ebitda. so we should see actually a slight uptick in gross margin, a slight downtick in sg&a, and then the ebitda was the 40 basis points. so, thanks for asking that for clarification.
54;11;35;1;0.02857142857142857;the team did a great job of managing expenses in the first quarter and will continue to do that. and, yes, it was down year over year, and we'll continue to manage our expenses.
54;12;12;0;0.0;no change. $1.8 billion. no change at all. peter, thank you.
54;13;426;14;0.03286384976525822;bob, it does not. obviously, it's been a question that we've asked ourselves. and, as cathy and john have both mentioned, we feel very good about the progress we're making from a strategic standpoint. we've talked multiple times now, certainly we talked to most of you on the call during our march investor day, our continued focus on building out our digital capabilities, we're making very good progress there. we think those are going to be essential to our future. we feel very good about the progress we're making on signature categories, where we continue to build market share and drive differentiation. we're very excited about the early results of pillowfort, and feel as if, when we launch our new cat & jack brand for kids, that is going to be another potential $1 billion brand in our portfolio. so, great progress from a category roll and signature category standpoint. as john mentioned during his remarks, our flex formats continue to be very well received as we move into new urban markets. we're excited about our tribeca store that will open up in october. but we've been excited about every one of these new flex formats, and they've been well received in both urban and college markets. we continue to think we've got significant opportunities in localization, and the work we've done in chicago and now los angeles just continues to confirm that. so, our strategy continues to perform well. john and the team continue to enhance our store and supply-chain capabilities to continue to meet the needs of our guests. so, as we sit here today, there's no significant change in our strategy, but, tactically, we recognize the consumer environment is tougher. we've got to make sure we're delivering the right value, we're winning with both the stock-up and the fill-in trip. we're making sure that we have the right experience for our guests, where they're shopping in-store and online, and we do not see any structural change in the consumer environment. we think this is a short-term bump in the road. but we think we're well positioned. and everything we see from a gdp and consumer confidence standpoint gives us the confidence that this is going to be a short-term impact and we're going to see very solid results in both the third and fourth quarter, and keep us on our long-term guidance track. thank you. thank you.
54;14;141;1;0.0070921985815602835;scott, it took place right after easter, during the month of april. so, a major effort inside of our stores. we touched, as i mentioned earlier, all of those center store grocery aisles. we added a number of new items, over 1,000. we brought new brands into those categories, and we've expanded our simply balanced line. so all that took place and it was very disruptive, and we planned for it in april. we now have the work behind us, and i'm very excited about the feedback we're receiving and the responses we're seeing in many of these categories. and certainly expect that we'll see those businesses accelerate, now that we have more relevant assortment. and we've significantly increased the representation of organic and natural and gluten-free and local items in those aisles.
54;15;198;3;0.015151515151515152;yes, i think that's largely the case, scott. again, as i said earlier, and i want to make sure we're really transparent about this with examples, we've seen very slow sales performance in the northeast. and, we have the same presentation. we had the same ad. we had the same value. we had the same great in-store experience. but on a day-in, day-out basis we're getting very different outcomes. so, on one hand, it gives me confidence to say what we're doing is working, because it's working in many parts of the country. but we have isolated geographies where, whether it's a late spring, whether it's a change in short-term consumer behavior, we're not seeing the same results. but we're delivering the same great content. so, i expect the northeast to recover. i think spring will arrive there. and i think when the guest is out shopping, they'll continue to choose target and we'll continue to provide them a great in-store and online experience. but we are seeing very significant geographic volatility, unlike anything i've seen in many, many years.
54;16;120;1;0.008333333333333333;scott, you're spot on. it's much more about consumables, household essentials. and, to be very clear, it's probably less about promotional intensity, but ensuring that we are promoting and presenting the right items, particularly at the back end of the month when the consumer and our guest is more likely to look for single-unit items, more items at a value. so we've got to make sure we're making the tactical adjustments to what we advertise, what we present in-store, and making sure that we're winning both with the stock-up guest, but also with the guest that's looking for value and looking for smaller, single-unit packs at the right value.
54;17;5;0;0.0;it's a fabulous store.
54;18;542;13;0.023985239852398525;i'm smiling, and i may turn this over to john. we've all actually visited our bixby store in long beach over the last few weeks. the store really captures the best of target in a smaller, 30,000-square-foot environment. and very positive reaction from the guest. so as we think about future flex formats, that is a model that we're excited about, a model that certainly seems to be connecting with the guest, and you should expect to see more of those as we go forward. but let me hand it over to john who's been intimately involved in the roll-out of flex formats and, specifically, the work we're doing in long beach. i would just -- obviously, we're very excited about the performance of the stores. i think the financial performance, certainly, but i think, like brian mentioned, really it's the guest reception of those stores. and, while they are very conveniently placed, like the bixby store, they're not convenience stores. the intent is to lead forward with what target does well -- home, apparel, our signature categories -- and that's what you really see in that bixby store. we will continue to increase the number we're doing as we go forward, but continue to test geographies and sizes of stores and how those two work together. obviously, the bixby store is quite large, and that's a little bit different neighborhood than we've done in the past. so the tribeca store that brian referenced, again, very different. very dense, urban store, two-level store. we continue to test configuration and neighborhood but feel very, very good about what we've found so far. and you'll see us continue to grow those number of stores that we open over the next several years. just to finish up on that, scott, i think the long beach store that you visited is a great example that really shows how we're approaching each of these initiatives. we are testing, we're learning, we're refining. the team's getting better and better at layout and assortment, and you've seen that when you walk the long beach location. and the feedback that we've received from the guest is, even in a smaller box, it feels like target. and it feels like the best of target. the work that the team's done in the center of that store to merchandise our soft lines is really outstanding. we're getting great feedback around our food presentation in that store. we've got the right home assortment. so we're tailoring that for the local market. but it's an example of the fact that we've been disciplined. we're not sprinting, we're making sure that we're really thoughtful. we're learning. we're adjusting. and you're seeing each of the new flex formats get better and better in layout, assortment, and tailoring to meet the local market. so, we are very excited about it, and we'll continue to take that learning and build it into new flex formats that we'll be opening up over the balance of this year and into next year. thanks, scott.
54;19;324;5;0.015432098765432098;well, john, as you might imagine, we're spending a lot of time, and have spent a lot of time, as a team looking at performance from a number of different vantage points, both internally, but also certainly incorporating external data. certainly it was an earlier easter. we recognize the impact of that. certainly weather in many major markets has been a factor. it's not an excuse. we've got to figure out how we perform under any circumstances. we know, as the guest and our consumer has moved through the course of 2016, prices at the pump, fuel prices have risen, and that's certainly an impact. and then when we look at a macro basis on overall spending, we certainly recognize that consumers are spending more on travel, on leisure activities, they've been investing in their homes, as i mentioned before. but there's no structural change that gives us pause and has us changing our strategy, altering our outlook for the full year. we think -- we're continuing to improve our digital capabilities. i think our store experience is improving each and every week. the response we're getting from the guest based on changes we made in apparel and home, and recently in food, are very encouraging. as john mentioned, our flex format's performing quite well. so we feel confident that the content we have in place, the plans we have for the second half of the year, some of the enhancements we've made from a branding and in-store and online standpoint are going to continue to deliver solid results. so we see this as a momentary speed bump, but we see no reason to alter our strategy. these are tactical adjustments we have to make. and, market by market, we've got to make sure we're well positioned to compete going forward. thank you. we've got time for one more question, operator.
54;20;199;6;0.03015075376884422;so we, obviously, have insight into where may is at today, and then we've got memorial day coming. we've got great plans around -- leading into memorial day and have every confidence we're going to have guests come to target, whether in our stores or online. and then, summer and warmer weather will come, and so we have an expectation that the trend we see today does not change overnight. but it does improve throughout the quarter because we've got some really great plans to deliver for our guests. and then also, in the latter part of this quarter, we have cat & jack launching, and we're very excited about cat & jack launching before back-to-school season. and we expect that to be a leading target-only brand that will be a $1 billion brand in time. so, chris, thanks for your question. and i really appreciate everyone who called in today. we tried to make sure we allotted significant time for your questions. hopefully, we had a chance to answer your questions, address some of your concerns. so, that will conclude our quarter. i appreciate your time today and thank you for dialing in.
55;1;146;5;0.03424657534246575;matt, as i discussed in my prepared comments, our traffic was impacted by a number of factors including cvs. do we certainly saw a slowdown in our pharmacy operations. we're working closely with cvs to launch the new marketing campaigns to win back our target guests, and certainly to begin to unlock the potential of their pbm network. so that certainly played a role. but we also had other factor that we're focused on right now. we're not pleased with the performance we saw in food, despite making some really good progress in presentation, improving our assortment, and certainly the freshness of our products. so our number one focus, as we sit here today is driving traffic back to our stores, and accelerating visits to our site. and addressing the pharmacy impact is just one of the variables we're focused on today.
55;2;179;5;0.027932960893854747;matt, for us it's a broader story across the product suite. and one of the first things we've had mark tritton do, is actually spend time with our apple partners, really making sure that we're putting the right plans together for the back half of the year, that we're ready to capitalize on their new innovation that they'll be bringing to market. but again, as we think about factors that we have to address to improve our traffic and overall sales performance in the back half of the year, we have to improve electronic performance. it was a significant drag, 70 basis points on our overall comp decline in the quarter, and apple played a significant role there. so we over-index with apple products, our guests come to us looking for those products, they're looking for the newness and innovation, and we're putting together plans with apple, and our merchandising teams to make sure we're ready to take advantage of that in the back half of the year. thanks, matt.
55;3;1;0;0.0; , david.
55;4;279;8;0.02867383512544803;well, matt, i think we've seen this environment persist now for well over a year. it's a very cautious consumer. if we look at the overall trends within retail, we've certainly seen on a rolling 12 month basis a slowdown in retail sales growth, but that's not an excuse for us. we got to make sure we're leveraging our strategic levers. we continue to make sure we improve our in-store experience. as john talked about during the call, we've got to make sure that we offer a sensational in-store pick-up experience. and also make sure that our site is easier to work with and allows us to ship directly to home. so we've got to make sure we're leveraging the key components of our strategy. i feel really good about the progress we've made in-store, in preparation for back-to-school, back-to-college, i've announced into a number of markets. i do not think our stores have ever looked better. so it's a competitive environment, it's going to continue to be a competitive environment, and we've got to make sure that we leverage our strategy, make sure that we're bringing the best of our signature categories, and bringing the value the guest is looking for in core household essentials, to win trips, and win back trips in the second half of the year. so it's competitive, but it's always competitive. and we've got to make sure that we're leveraging our assets, and our strategy to continue to drive performance in the back half of the year.
55;5;235;3;0.01276595744680851;david, you've used an important term that i've been using internally, and that is balance or rebalancing. and as i look at my experience now over the last couple of years at target, we're best when we balance both ends of our brand positioning. we've got to deliver on the expect more component, and i think we've done a sensational job there. our progress in apparel and home has been really significant, and we've got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise, and that's the pay less side. and that's all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively in-store, in our circular, on our end caps, to our guest each and every week. so as we think about the back half of the year, and the keys to driving our business going forward, we've got to have both of those levers in balance. we've got to continue to make sure our signature categories, and particularly those important style categories, continue to connect with our guest. and we've got to deliver a great value through household essentials, those every day products that drive that target run. so that balance or rebalance is critically important to the actions we're taking in the back half of the year. thanks, david.
55;6;907;22;0.024255788313120176;oliver, let me try to break apart those three questions, and have cathy and john jump in as appropriate. as we think about the rebalancing, and the work we're doing from a merchandising stance point, an in-store presentation standpoint, and also a weekly advertising standpoint. we recognize we have to continue to deliver the right presentation for that stock up occasion, and particularly in the back half of the month, have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right availability of the items our guest is looking for in that fill in occasion. so we're activating and ensuring we put those changes in place, to find the balance as we speak today. so we're certainly very focused and aware of the fact that we have to win on both fronts. we have the right assortment for that stock [up] occasion, and we need to make sure we have the right pack price architecture to meet the needs of the guest during that fill in occasion -- so we're very focused on that. from a cvs standpoint, i'll let john jump in here. it's not a surprise to us that there has been some disruption and i think, for all of us on the call, we know what it's like when we change a pharmacy prescription, and move from one provider to another. and while they're staying in our location, they've got to sign up for some new programs, they're entering a new environment. there is some time that's going to take. but we've been very pleased. john has been working with his cvs counterparts on the transition. we've had great collaboration, great partnership. we're starting to activating the marketing and the personalized messaging. and we expect over time, we'll see that business accelerate, and we expect pharmacy and the partnership to be a future driver of traffic and growth. but john, why do not you talk about some of the things we're doing at the store level with cvs? yes, i think i'd start by first echoing what brian said, we talked going into the deal, we had a great partner. and that is certainly what we have observed through the transition here, been a great partner to work with. our teams have worked together very well to transition. we've done the best job we can, in transitioning guests. but as brian said change is change, and sometimes you just need to work through that. from a go-forward perspective, we're working with cvs, certainly on some of their capabilities that they'll bring to bear for target. and as brian said, unlock their pbm network into our stores. but more importantly day-to-day, in the stores, we see great guest service -- continue to see great guest service from our pharmacists. cvs would note that probably the best score they've ever seen in a transition like this. and then starting to work with them, to engage the pharmacy more back into the store, through things like the opportunity here at back-to-school, back-to-college with flu shots, and having the pharmacy play a more prominent role as we go forward. and so the teams continue to develop plans like that. they're very focused on it. we're focused on it, and we're very excited about the opportunity here, as we continue to move forward. hey, oliver, this is cathy. i'll add a little bit more too around priorities for driving traffic in the back half, and that we're really excited to be going to this part of the year, where we have a lot of events, and that's where target really has some great plans. we always have great plans, back-to-school back-to-college. we're excited about, obviously, the launch cat & jack has started out very successfully, with a lot of learnings that we took away from pillowfort, both online and in stores. and then obviously, we go into our prime time. and so standing tall on the events that we typically have always done, but we're really well positioned. and then, it's the things that brian and john have already mentioned, the rebalancing of our messaging, that we are re-looking at all of our grocery efforts around presentation, assortment and promotion, at the electronics, the newness that brian mentioned. then, obviously, the work that john just said around cvs. yes. so oliver, as we think about the second half, we've got to continue to build on the things that are working today. even in a challenging second quarter, we grew market share in the important apparel space. we saw very strong results in our home categories. we continue to be a destination for toys. so we've got to build on the things that are working and ensure that we're also winning trips for those core household essentials. so we'll be focusing on rebalancing, on leveraging the improvements we've made both in-store, with our in-store pick-up process and also online. and we're not altering our strategic focus, it's making sure we get our strategies in balance, and we deliver against both signature categories, and those important household essentials that drive traffic to our stores, and put cars in the parking lot. thanks, oliver.
55;7;0;0;NA; .
55;8;209;9;0.0430622009569378;well, we certainly think we are winning in the apparel space. and i think a lot of that's really driven by the changes we've made, the improvement in our assortment, in quality, in being more on trend with some of our fashion assortment. i talked about xhilaration performing very well in the quarter,. who what wear continues to be a real winner for us, and connecting well with our guests. and we've also matched that up with an improved in-store experience. and we've been talking about mannequins for awhile, but the role that our visual merchandisers are playing. the investment that john and i made last year to ensure we had, not only mannequins and home vignettes, but the talent in our stores to maintain that experience 52 weeks a year is certainly connecting with the guests. so we think we're benefiting by really executing against the strategy we've been talking about for several years, making sure we have the right quality, innovation, presentation in our stores, and we surround our guests with great service. and that's paying off with market share gains in a challenging environment, where we continue to see improvement in our apparel and home assortments. thank you.
55;9;192;3;0.015625;yes, greg, we certainly do, and cathy and i talked about this at the end of the first quarter. we've seen quite a bit of variability on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis between different markets. we've seen particular strength in many of our west coast markets, very strong performance in california, driven by great performance in la and san francisco, but other parts of the west coast. we've seen pockets of softness on the east coast. and we've really tried to make sure market by market, we're looking at those dynamics, looking at the competitive dynamics, understanding what we can leverage from the markets where we are seeing increases like los angeles, and bring that into challenged markets. but we've seen over the course of this year in 2016, much more variability than i've seen in many, many years. so we're drilling down on that. and as we think about our plans for the second half of the year, we're building market-specific action plans to make sure we address the market-specific needs of our stores and our guests.
55;10;1;0;0.0;yes.
55;11;21;0;0.0;yes, so it's slightly down ebit margin, we said gross margin and sg&a about where they were last year.
55;12;14;0;0.0;it is slightly up. so yes, so slightly down q3, slightly up in q4.
55;13;13;0;0.0;greg, we're very comfortable right now with our inventory position. thank you.
55;14;165;6;0.03636363636363636;dan, i think it's largely driven by the new innovation that we bring to the guests in the fourth quarter. so we've certainly seen pockets of strength. i mean, there's certainly winners and losers within that space. we've seen continued performance with wearable technology. but it's not overcoming the softness we've seen in mobile, in tablets, and in some of the core items. so i think the success of that category, as always is going to be driven by new news, and news that connects with the guest, and drives traffic into those categories. so again, it's why mark and his team are very focused right now, in working with our electronics vendors to make sure we have the right innovation, we're presenting it in a way that's impactful for the guest, and we have to see improvements in a category that's been a big drag on our comps over the last couple of quarters.
55;15;200;4;0.02;yes, i think, dan there's been a lot written recently about the competitive nature of the food channel. and for us on one hand, we feel, i feel, really good about the progress we've made with assortment. if you walk our stores today versus even six months ago, aisle by aisle, you're seeing more organic, more natural, more gluten-free, more local items that are on trend. the freshness and the work that john and his team have done from a supply chain standpoint is clearly connecting with the product we're delivering to the guests. and we've seen an uptick in categories like produce, because we're delivering better product. but at the same time, market by market, this is a very competitive space. there's clearly food deflation right now that we're facing, and it's a very competitive environment. and back to the earlier question about traffic and performance trends by market, we're looking very specifically at food by market across the country, because we face a number of regional competitors, and we've got to make sure our presentation, our promotion, our approach enables us to compete market by market.
55;16;171;5;0.029239766081871343;well, dan, we've certainly used it as a learning lab, but our intention is to lift the winners from la25, and quickly bring them into other stores across the country. and while it's still very early, we have effectively one quarter of learning under our belt, i'm very pleased with some of the results we're seeing in apparel, in home. and certainly in food, whereas i mentioned during my prepared comments, we're seeing performance in those 25 test stores that are clearly, really encouraging from a food standpoint, particularly in the perishable space. so we'll be looking to leverage that learning. that's part of our strategy that we've articulated for several quarters now, that we want to use la as a test market to lift and shift the winning concepts into more stores across the country. and we'll continue to lift and leverage the learning from la25, to improve the experience in the presentation of product throughout our target stores. thank you.
55;17;290;8;0.027586206896551724;well, scott, i'll start with, we're playing to win. and we've invested heavily in that very important category. we've had a long-term commitment to food, we think it's very important for our guest. and over the last couple of years, while we've done it in a very disciplined fashion, category by category, and i appreciate hearing you say that you've seen an improvement in execution, and hopefully in presentation. now we've added thousands of new items, and we've worked with our vendor partners to make sure we're bringing the right innovation, category by category. our team is absolutely going, literally item by item, commodity by commodity, to look at how we source, and how we flow product to improve freshness, and the quality we present to our guests. so we've got to make sure we have the right assortment, the right presentation, the right quality. we have to have the right promotional strategy to compete, but we're playing to win both short- and long-term. we think that it's very important that we continue to make progress in this space. we're going to make sure we do it in a very focused manner. we really like what we're seeing in la25. we're not going to roll it out to 1,800 stores tomorrow. we're making sure we that can validate what's working, and how can we drive profitable sales in that space. but we are playing to win in food. we're going to continue to roll up our sleeves, and make sure that we're into the details, finding ways to unlock the growth potential in that critically important category.
55;18;371;8;0.0215633423180593;yes, and scott, in all due respect to the journal, let me speak on behalf of our leadership team and the board. we have no hesitancy at all, in investing capital in our business that drives growth and the right returns. as cathy has demonstrated throughout the last few calls, even in challenging times, we generate significant cash flows. and we want to make sure the first thing we do with that cash is invest back in our business. so it's why we're spending time, looking at la25. it's why we've been testing a number of different features throughout our stores, from apparel, to home, to food. it's why we're so excited about investing in flex formats, where we see a very strong response from the guest. those are delivering very strong returns, well ahead of our original plans, and food plays an important part in those smaller flex formats. so despite what you may be hearing, we have absolutely complete support from the board to make sure we're investing capital behind the initiatives that are going to drive future growth. so again, we're not just playing for just the short-term, we're playing for the long-term. those capital investments have to be done on behalf of the guest and our shareholders, but we're looking right now at a number of different opportunities to continue to invest to drive growth. so there's no hesitancy at all in making those investments. and as you just said, food and perishable and consumable categories will play a very important role in driving traffic to our stores. and in the future, we've got to continue to bundle that with the work john's doing, to make sure and we're investing and improving our in-store pick-up processes and experience. that's an investment we're making, and an investment we're making for the holiday season. we're continuing to invest in our digital assets. so there's no hesitancy at all, from this management team nor the board, in making the right investments in our long-term success. thanks, scott. operator, we've got time for one last call.
55;19;274;3;0.010948905109489052;yes. joe, it's a great question for us to end on, and i'll take personal responsibility for this. i've talked earlier about the fact we've got to be rebalancing our messaging, and we've done a really terrific job of elevating our messaging and communication around our signature, and particularly our style categories. as we go forward -- i've used this term before, we've got to make sure we're rebalancing, and we got to make sure we continue to elevate our messaging, our communication around style and those core household essential categories, which include food, that drive traffic to our store and are important to our guest. so making sure we go back to the brand promise. we've got to make sure those expect more categories like style, we continue to elevate. and we've got to make sure we deliver the pay less component, and ensure that we balance the work that we're doing from a style standpoint, with the progress we're making on those core household essentials, which include food in that offering. so it's really an important question. it's certainly a big area of focus for us, on the balance of the year, and into 2017. and i think, it's going to be part of the formula that drives traffic back to our stores, and improves comp store growth over the balance of the year and into 2017. so operator, with that, we're going to conclude our call. and i thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call today. thank you for participating.
56;1;148;6;0.04054054054054054;bob, . as we think about the holiday season, we expect it to be a very competitive promotional environment, like we've seen over the last couple of years. so we think we've got great plans in place. we're very excited about the merchandising, the marketing and promotional plans, and we think we're going to be very competitive throughout the season. as it pertains to toys, again, we've had a multi-year positive run in that category. and one of the things that's really been important for us is working with key partners like disney, mattel, hasbro, to make sure we bring new exclusive items to our assortment. as we go into the holiday season, we're excited to have 1,800 exclusive items in that category, and we think these are going to be very important to our guests throughout the holiday season.
56;2;264;14;0.05303030303030303;bob, as we think about our strategy and our approach, while we're certainly very pleased with the progress we saw in the third quarter, it's a result of being very focused on the strategy we've had in place for almost 2.5 years now. our results and the improvement we saw in the third quarter is really driven by, one, our focus on those signature categories, our commitment to apparel and home, baby and kids, where we continue to see very strong growth and market share improvement. we've been very committed to improving our digital engagement and year-to-date we're up over 20%. we saw 26% growth in the third quarter. and the investments we've been making to improve functionality and ease online is certainly connecting with our guests. we've been very focused, as we've talked about, in expanding our format into new urban neighborhoods. and every time we open up a new store, whether it's in new york in tribeca, or philadelphia, we're seeing a great response from our guests. and we've been on a journey over the last couple of years to drive greater efficiency throughout our organization, and with john's leadership, we continue to see very strong improvement in operational efficiencies and costs that we're returning to the bottom line. so our focus over the third quarter is very similar to the journey we've been on for the last couple of years, and we've just intensified our focus on executing against our key strategic planks.
56;3;213;8;0.03755868544600939;as we think about the next several years, you're going to continue to see us make significant investments in our assets, improve the in-store experience. we're already seeing the benefits of the investments we've made in apparel and home. we're very pleased with some of the learnings from la25 that we'll be transitioning into our new remodels as we go forward. so we think the importance of the in-store experience, great customer service, continuing to bring newness to our assortment, elevating and developing our own brands. i think one of the big highlights for target in 2016 is the way our guest has reacted to two great new brands, both pillowfort and cat & jack have been incredibly well-received. the style, the quality, the value we're delivering is connecting with our guest. so the combination of great in-store experience, making sure we surround our guest with great customer service, whether they're shopping in our store or they've ordered online and they're coming in to pick up that order. and then delivering great target brands at a value. so we think that combination is the strategy that drives traffic into our stores, cars into our parking lot, and even more engagement online.
56;4;172;6;0.03488372093023256;scott, i will start with, scripts matter a lot to us. and key to the partnership with cvs is making sure we're working together to drive scripts, because back to the importance of traffic, scripts will be an important part of driving traffic to our stores, and we were very pleased in the third quarter with the progress we were seeing. we're seeing much greater awareness now that we've competed the new branding. the combination of our in-store marketing and cvs marketing at their pbm is driving increased traffic to the pharmacies, so that is a very important lever going forward. and we're very confident in our partnership. john mulligan works very closely with the cvs team. we've got great plans in place for the fourth quarter, and even stronger plans as we go into 2017. so that is a very, very important part of the traffic equation. and we think over time that's going to be a key driver of traffic into our stores.
56;5;284;11;0.03873239436619718;greg, let me start on the grocery side. clearly, we have more work to do there, but we feel like we're making very good progress. changes we made to assortment, improvements we've made to the quality of our produce items, and we're certainly pleased with the reaction we're seeing as we enhance the experience in our la25 stores. that being the case, we've got to continue to make sure we build a greater connection with our guest, as it pertains to the convenient food offering we provide. mark and i are working closely on the next phase of our grocery evolution, to make sure that we continue to provide the right assortment, the right value, the right quality our guest expects from target, while they're shopping our store. so you'll see a lot more of that, when we get together in february, but we recognize that's an area that we've got to continue to drive progress in. from a loyalty standpoint, we are working very closely with the marketing team, to ensure that when we get together with you in february, we'll be able to talk about the next iteration of our personalization and loyalty programs. key to that, greg, is bringing together some of the great assets we already have in place, leveraging our redcard, leveraging cartwheel, which continues to see great response from the guests, and making it easy for the guests to leverage the existing loyalty assets we have in place. so we think that's a key unlock as we go into 2017 and beyond, and that will be a key topic of conversation when we see you in february.
56;6;219;6;0.0273972602739726;we're very focused on our own opportunity. we're in 30 locations today. we think we have the opportunity to enter many, many new neighborhoods. we're really focused on making sure we build the back-end capabilities in supply chain, in assortment management, the in-store operating capabilities it takes to run these smaller stores. we think the unique opportunity we have is bringing the best of target to these individual neighborhoods, making sure that we custom tailor assortment, we bring the right assortment of apparel and home, baby and kids that's right for that neighborhood, complement it with convenient foods and household essentials that really make that local target run impactful for the guest. so we're still learning. we're very pleased with the feedback. but as we enter very competitive markets like new york, we're going to learn a lot from tribeca, we'll take that to other locations. as we do more and more business adjacent to college campuses, we'll understand more and more about the needs of the college student. we really think right now, we've got a unique opportunity to leverage this new footprint as a future growth element in our strategy, and the guest continues to say thank you every time we enter a new neighborhood.
56;7;200;8;0.04;matt, i'd start with, we feel really good about the way mark and his team have managed gross margin throughout the quarter. but it's really a byproduct of the strength we continue to see in those important signature categories, and both in store, but importantly online. our growth has been led by apparel and home, great strength in baby and kids, those important high-margin categories that drive differentiation for our brand. so the benefits that we're seeing in gross margin are a byproduct of the strategy we had in place, and really making sure that we're building market share, we're bringing great style and design and newness to those signature categories. the payback has been margin expansion while we continue to invest in value, and getting back to rebalancing our brand promise. we're bringing tremendous product to the expect more side. and now we've rebalanced our value message on a pay less side. so we were able to invest in value throughout the third quarter, and still see gross margin rate expansion. so we feel really good about the balance we're bringing there, and think that could be sustained over time.
56;8;114;5;0.043859649122807015;again, john, it comes back to the mix of our business, and the strength we're seeing, particularly in categories like home. the strength we're seeing in apparel and accessories, some of the strength we're seeing in baby and kids. so those are important categories. obviously in many cases, higher ticket, still a great value for our guest, but higher ticket. and obviously offset by some weakness we've seen in the grocery category. so the mix is clearly impacting those metrics you're seeing. and we feel very good about the way the guest has reacted to the quality, the style and the value we're offering in those signature categories.
56;9;66;2;0.030303030303030304;absolutely, and again, as we noted in our earlier comments, while overall we saw our digital business grow by 26%, the bulk of that business, the high growth areas were in apparel and home. so again, higher ticket items, we feel really good about the progress we're making from a digital mix standpoint, and that's also coming through in the metrics you're seeing.
56;10;218;7;0.03211009174311927;chris, backing up and i know there are a number of embedded questions there, there was some shift because of the promotion between q2 and q3. i'd really focus on the year-to-date number. year-to-date from a digital standpoint, we've been growing at 20%. as we talked about earlier in the call, we're very pleased with the reaction we're seeing during key event periods. back-to-college, back-to-school, a very important period for us, both in-store and online. and we think the combination of the investments we've made to improve ease, functionality of our digital engagement, and the fact that we're certainly showing the ability to win during key holiday and thematic periods, that's the right balance for us going forward. we think digital is going to be an important part of our growth strategy going forward. we think digital is certainly the way our guest interfaces with the brand, whether they're in-store or online, and we're very pleased with the progress we're making. our overall growth rate is approximately 2x the digital industry. so we're building market share. we're winning during key seasons. and we certainly expect that to be a key driver to our fourth-quarter success.
56;11;84;1;0.011904761904761904;chris, this is cathy. as we said, we're guiding for ebit margin to be up about 10 basis points. we do -- cvs was -- we closed it remember, about halfway through the fourth quarter last year, so we'll get a little bit of that impact still. the biggest driver in the fourth quarter as we said was the -- is sg&a. so we'll continue to see some improvement there, and that's going to get us that 10 basis of ebit margin.
56;12;6;0;0.0;robert, we appreciate that. thank you.
56;13;240;10;0.041666666666666664;great question, robbie. i think the team has made a lot of progress, and as we said, at least the way we measure it today, our in-stocks, out of stocks is actually the number we focus more on, is at our historically low number. so we feel great about that. having said that, we think there continues to be significant opportunity for us and i think we see opportunity first at a store level, ensuring we always have what the guest wants when they walk in, because even though we've improved meaningfully, there's still a lot of distance there to go. and then more important than that, digitally ensuring we have the right unit at the right place for the guest, whether they want to come in store and pick it up, whether we're going to ship that from a store, or ship that from a fulfillment center. today, we're not completely optimized there, either. while we've seen great progress, and there's absolutely benefit to the guest and their trust with us when they come into the store over time, we still think there's a lot of runway there for us to improve. and you'll continue to see us focus on reliability and speed in our supply chain, and those are the two things that we will continue to drive against, over not only next year but the next several years.
56;14;398;11;0.02763819095477387;dan, it's a great question and obviously we feel really good about the support we received during back-to-college and back-to-school. in those off holiday periods, we've got to make sure we've got the right balance between newness and those important style categories, and great value in our household essentials and food. mark and his team have spent a tremendous amount of time reshaping our promotional strategies, making sure that both in our circular, but also in store. it's really clear to our guest that we've got this great combination of newness and style, and the value our guest deserves and is looking for in those key household essential areas. so we've done a lot of work in-store. i think with mark's leadership, we're clarifying value on our end caps, clear assortment that connects with the guest in those off-holiday periods. so i feel really good about the progress. you'll see more of that as we go into the fourth quarter. but why do not i let mark talk about some of the work that he's been leading, as we think about really ensuring that value message is very clear to our guests, when they're walking our stores each week? yes, hi brian. thanks, john. what we've seen is a hyper competitive market in the first half of the year and it really made us take stock to look at how do we represent and resonate value to our guest more readily. so what you're seeing emerging in third quarter and more in the fourth quarter and beyond is a representation not just of price and value in our circulars, as brian talked about, but in store ensuring the guest clearly sees that value up front and center. representation on our end caps, increasing single price point end caps to really generate a buzz about our value, and really delivering on expect more, pay less. so this is a continuing trend, and then the spaces between the key seasonal events that you raised, as brian said, we're hyper focused on that. we've seen some strength in some of our options that we've put in place, and really looking forward to our plans about how do we continue guest traffic and post major events, where we do win.
56;15;199;4;0.020100502512562814;let me start with e&e. as i mentioned in my earlier comments, we feel really good about our plans for the fourth quarter. and obviously entertainment, electronics and toys are critically important gifting items for the fourth quarter. so again, i think the work that mark and his team have done to make sure, working with our vendor partners, we have a combination of new items, exclusive items, items that are on trend, we've seen a great reaction to our toy and gifting catalog, and we think that we're very well positioned for the fourth quarter. those categories did trend downward in q3, but the important part of the year is in front of us, and i think we're very well-positioned. from a script standpoint, we are still rebuilding some momentum in that space, but sequentially we've seen improvement from q1 to q2 and q3. we recognize that with time, as the branding's in place, as our in store marketing and the cvs marketing takes shape, we're going to be rebuilding and growing scripts in that very important part of our store. operator, we've got time for one more call.
56;16;459;10;0.02178649237472767;oliver, great way to wrap up the call. from a fill-in and stock-up standpoint, again, the work that mark just talked about on the value side, is clearly addressing the fill-in guest. i feel very good about the progress we've made and will continue to make in that space. i think to the broader question, it's a terrific way for us to wrap up before we all get together in new york city. we continue to feel very good about the strategy we have in place, and how that will allow us to be very competitive, and continue to win in the current retail environment. we think the investments we're making in our stores are critically important, and that store experience that we continue to elevate is a very important measure for our guest. we've learned, as i hope you have, guests still like physical stores. and year-to-date, still almost 90% of all retail shopping is taking place in a physical store. so we've got to make sure we've got a great experience, we've got great service, we continue to elevate that experience and service, and combine it with outstanding merchandise and value every time our guests shop. we think our strategy of moving into new neighborhoods, whether it's these densely populated urban centers or on college campuses, is a critical growth vehicle. and again, the reaction we've seen every time he we open up a store in boston, philadelphia, chicago, and certainly in new york, tells us our guest loves the convenience of having target right there in their neighborhood. but we're also continuing to make investments online. and we want to make sure we continue to give our guest the choice of shopping any way they want. the ease of shopping online and picking up in our store, which we think is going to be a very important factor during the fourth quarter. but building out those capabilities, leveraging our stores as flexible fulfillment centers. as we go into this holiday season, well over 1,000 locations will be locations that not only you can shop in and pick up, but we're using to deliver the last mile. we think that's a huge competitive advantage. so we feel very good about the strategy we have in place. we think it's a strategy that will win, not only in the short term, but over the long term. we look forward to seeing all of you in new york in february. so with that, operator, we're go to wrap up our third-quarter call. i appreciate everyone participating, and we look forward to seeing you in new york in february.
57;1;208;2;0.009615384615384616;chris, let me talk about the pricing investments we're making. and i think, as most of you know, coming out of the data breach, we invested heavily in promotions. as we go forward, we're going back to our roots and reestablishing our everyday low price commitment. so that's going to take some time. it's starting today. we're going to make sure that we reestablish our value with the guest. there's an investment we have to make. and we also recognize we have to continue to invest in digital, to grow that channel, to continue to make sure we are accelerating market share. you're going to see us invest in 2017. as john talked about, we expect greater efficiencies over time. one, as we continue to optimize our digital performance, but importantly, as we transform our supply chain. but in the short term, we have to compete, we have to invest to make sure we're delivering the value the guest is looking for. we want to make sure we're taking market share, both in-store and online, and we think those are two very important investments in the near term that provide long-term benefits for the company. thank you.
57;2;207;1;0.004830917874396135;i will go back to what cathy talked about just a few minutes ago. we certainly view 2017 as year of investment. in 2018 we will continue to transition as these different initiatives begin to mature. as we get into 2019 and beyond, we certainly expect stability and a return to growth. that's the model we are looking at. we can not lay it out for you quarter-by-quarter. we want to make sure we're properly investing and accelerating these initiatives. and if there's a message i want everyone to walk away with today, these are not new initiatives. we've been working on these for several years. now is the time for us to go faster. this is about accelerating at the right pace for our business. but whether it's our digital channel, the work john talked about in the supply chain, the acceleration of remodeling our existing stores and reimagining that experience, or opening up these new smaller formats, we've got to step on the accelerator. and as they mature, we are going to return to growth, we're going to capture market share, and we're certainly going to see the benefits that our shareholders are looking for.
57;3;267;1;0.003745318352059925;craig, it's a great question, and it's embedded in everything we've talked about today. the reinvestment in our stores, reimagining over the next few years hundreds and hundreds of stores. we've certainly learned in our tests in both los angeles, and as we've remodeled stores in texas, that as we bring a new experience that drives traffic to our stores. as mark and his team continue to roll out these new proprietary brands that are unique to target, that drives traffic to both our stores and our site, and we've seen that with cat & jack, a $1 billion brand in year one, on its way to being the number one kids brand in america. so as we continue to elevate brands, those drive traffic to both our stores and our site. as we move into our new urban neighborhoods, it's striving for traffic every single day. so as we think about how this smart network comes together, brands play an important role, that in-store experience is critically important, being in the right neighborhoods. but then we also know from a digital standpoint, more and more of our guests are ordering online and conveniently coming to our stores to pick up that order. that allows us to really make sure that once they're in our store they continue to shop. all of these elements are all about driving traffic to our stores and more visits to our site, and as they mature, that certainly is going to be one of the key metrics that we will all be tracking.
57;4;450;6;0.013333333333333334;let me start with price, let mark talk about brands, and the cathy can talk about our real estate portfolio. i think you answered the question for us. as we think about the investments we're making in price, we will start with those core essential and food categories. those trip drivers that craig just referred to. we've got to make sure that we move from a promotional cadence back to our traditional every day low price and great value every time the guest shops in those core personal care, household essential, and food categories. we will certainly make sure we're revisiting price across the box, but it certainly starts with making sure we are priced right on those trip driving items that our guests depend on target for every day. mark, why do not you talk about some of the brand work? yes, as we roll out the new brand work we're looking at guest insights about what brands and what spaces we should play in, but more importantly, what is the sweet spot on pricing for regular everyday pricing. so as we reset these brands, we are going to be defining great value every day for our guest as we introduce in every niche in the business. robby, i will quickly address store portfolio. as we said, we've had a very disciplined process forever. the team has done a great job. our pace does not change, we've been closing about 10 to 15 stores a year, that has been consistent year in and year out. we will continue to do that, but that's just normal course for us. we look at every store every year and say does it make sense to keep open. today the answer is, yes. universally generate positive cash cathy, on the store front, just to close that out, and i know we talked about it during our prepared remarks but our store portfolio is not mall-based. we are in some of the centers where most of the retailers are trying to migrate to. we're very fortunate that over time we built 1,800 stores that are effectively located. they are in the right neighborhoods, they are not off remotely on interstates, they are not tied to dying malls. we have an obligation to revitalize some of those stores and re-image some of the stores, but one of the things that where most confident about is we have an exceptional store portfolio. so as we invest, as we bring those stores up to the expectation our guest has from target, we expect those to drive traffic and continue to flourish in the years to come.
57;5;277;3;0.010830324909747292;matt, i'd start out by talking about the last couple years as being a time of very disciplined capital allocation. we've taken a very surgical approach to some of these initiatives. we've remodeled 25 stores in los angeles. we've been testing and learning and iterating, improving the expectation that the guest has, making sure we deliver against that. now that we've got the feedback, we're ready to accelerate. john talked about we have opened up 32 small formats, not 300. we studied each one of those very carefully to make sure we understood how to customize them for new local neighborhoods. now that we understand the expectation, we are ready to accelerate. from a capital standpoint, we've actually benefited from the fact that mike has taken a very disciplined approach to setting priorities within technology, and we've seen phenomenal improvement in our platforms, our capabilities at a lower cost. our approach to capital has been very disciplined. we've been testing and validating and learning. now that the learning is complete we are ready to accelerate those investments. but we have been very disciplined. john talked about supply chain. we know the changes that we need to make, but we have been very surgical, very disciplined in putting together that playbook. now that it's in place, we will begin to accelerate. so from a capital standpoint, we will continue to make sure we're very thorough, we test and validate, but once we've completed the learning, we will be ready to accelerate. and that's what you're seeing as we think about the next three years.
57;6;337;9;0.026706231454005934;why do not i start and then i will let mark talk about some of the progress we've seen on grocery. and while we did not spend a lot of time on it today, i want to make sure it's very clear. we're very focused on improving our grocery performance. but we have not just been standing still. we've made significant progress in procurement, in supply chain, in making sure we've improved our assortment, in making sure in those test stores in los angeles and dallas we understand the changes that need to be made in the in-store experience. we're going to follow it up immediately with the right investment in pricing to make sure we are competitively priced every day in those key categories. so we've got more work to do, we're certainly not satisfied with where we are, but we have been making progress, and there's bright spots, mark, that i think you can talk to? yes, just looking at the format, fresh produce is a really good example where we've changed our supply chain, our assortment and are focused on quality and value. so investing there has really made a difference where the guest has perceived and responded to with great growth in key categories. so here we've invested in fresh, and we've gone from an organization that used to deliver multi-times a week to every single day, increasing the freshness and quality and guests are responding. some of the tests that brian talked about in la and dallas have really paid dividends for us. and one great example of that is our adult beverage business where we've seen great growth in 2016, and we're going to amplify that growth and accelerate in 2017. this is a business that for us was our number one growth category throughout all target, and we see an upside of $1 billion business here that we're fast tracking on in 2017.
57;7;232;7;0.03017241379310345;mark? yes, so the key focus of the brand growth is really in what we talked about with john, and our key strength there is apparel, accessories, footwear and home. these are high margin and high strength areas for us. and we believe that target has the right dna on exclusivity and differentiation. our guests love it, our brands, and have loved them. but we've been a little slow here in terms of the changing face of the guest. and i guess the insights showed that we could sharpen that and bring new ideas. great proof of concept in 2016 with the launch of who, what, where, pillowfort and, of course, cat & jack, that showed us where we replaced our strengths with a new focus we could create double-digit comps and guest love and trips for our store. so we've taken key areas across -- men's, women's, home and kids and are going to amplify our offers there and redefine. in terms of overall space, we're just utilizing our existing space and really refreshing that. one of the things we're excited about in 2017 is this combination of new brands, capital investment in the space for those brands, but also the addition of extra resources like visual merchandising. they're really going to create a new experience for the guest in-store and create real excitement.
57;8;142;3;0.02112676056338028;why do not i start. i think the proof is in the results we've delivered. outstanding results, as we've talked about with the launch of pillowfort. the same thing has been true with cat & jack. this is an example of where we've gotten the value equation right. great quality, on trend, at a great value and the guest response has been terrific. that's the same approach mark is going to take with each one of those new brands, making sure we combine great quality, items that are on trend for the consumer with the right value that drives trips, but also makes sure the guest recognizes they're getting value from target, so coming back to our brand promise. expect more and pay less. those elements have to work hand-in-hand with our new brands going forward.
57;9;721;19;0.026352288488210817;john, do you want to start with supply chain and we will finish up with guidance. sure. i think, the past year we spent doing really two things in supply chain. one was just optimizing what we do today to improve out-of-stocks in-store which had been a chronic problem for us. they have improved dramatically, they're not where they need to be but they have improved. the second thing we focused on is right to the heart of your question, which is, how do we optimize the entirety of our supply chain, go back and relook at everything to, one, take work out of the store, and, two, be much more efficient in how we deliver and especially on the last mile. we spent the last couple years expanding our ship from store capability. we have believed for a long time that is the single best advantage we have in the supply chain is our store network. it puts us right next to the guest. and what we're working on today is how we move inventory more efficiently and more quickly in each because that is what is required for direct-to-guest. out to the stores and then from the store directly to the guest and do that quickly. you will see us this year, as i said, start to make those changes in the northeast. several pilots are already underway that have significantly improved our speed to guest. and, as i said -- as cathy said, we will continue to come back and report on how we're doing. but that is the heart of what we're doing. that becomes the basis for improving. everything mike can do is giving him flexibility to put services on top and to deliver at whatever speed the guest wants. in a store like tribeca that could be today. hey, i came in, picked up my five things, i'm going to go run some errands with the kids, deliver this to my house in three hours. it could also mean, hey, bring this to my house in 10 days, this patio set, bring it to the back of my house, set it up, detrash it and take the garbage way. it's really about flexibility and speed and allowing the guest to choose how they want to interact with us. and that's what we're building the platform of our supply chain around. kathy, why do not i start by talking about the competitive landscape and let cathy talk about guidance. but to your point, we certainly see over the next three years significant market share opportunities as we see the contraction in our competitive store base. and that is going to be particularly true in the apparel and home spaces where we're strongest. but we also recognize, as you do, as many retailers are closing stores, if not exiting the business. the short-term implication is massive promotional discounts which takes consumers out of the marketplace for a period of time. so over the long haul, this is a growth story we are putting together. we think we are going to see significant market share opportunities across a number of categories. to capture that, we need to make sure we've got the right in-store experience and a very strong and easy digital experience for that guest. but in the near term, you're going to see deep discounting, you are going to see liquidation sales, which takes prices down and takes consumer trips out of the marketplace. but over time, we see significant market share opportunities. yes, the only thing i'll add on to that, because that's where i was going to go too, is we are absolutely investing to be able to play offense. we see this as a huge opportunity for target when you think about the playing field that's going to be available. and so we are investing to play offense. but i do not anticipate, and we do not anticipate, that to be demonstrably changing this year. this year is an investment year for us. as we set ourselves up for that great success to take the share over the next multiple years, there is going to be a ton of disruption in this space.
57;10;869;18;0.020713463751438434;why do not i start by talking about food, let mark add some additional color, and then give mike a chance talk about our digital approach going forward. one of the things that we've talked about over the last year as it pertains to target's food and beverage offering is the recognition that we do not have a full service grocery experience. we do not have meat and seafood counters, we do not have deli counters. we do not provide a full assortment of experiences and services that many of our full-line competitors do. but we can offer a great self-service, convenient experience. and that starts with the right quality, the right assortment, the right in-store experience, great value. we've got to make sure we are supplying those products to our guests every single day to make sure the freshness is there. so we are embracing who we are. and we want to make sure that the guest knows while they're shopping at target there is no compromise. we've got to build trust, we've got to make sure that while they are there shopping for their baby, picking up a toy for a saturday night birthday party, picking up something new to wear for dinner that night they have confidence in the selection and breadth of food products we offer. we are being true to who we are and we're not a full service grocer. we do not have rotisserie ovens in our stores, but we do have the right allocation of space and selection to compete and be that convenient alternative in food, and we're going to held on that going forward. we're very pleased with the response we've seen in los angeles in dallas where we enhance that experience, where we improve the assortment. the reaction, as mark talked about, to categories like craft beer and wine that fit in very well with the target guest. we've got to strengthen that offering, make sure we have got great quality, the right assortment, that we've got the right experience in-store. and that we provide the right value the guest is looking for. so we will continue to build off of that going forward and make sure that while our guests are shopping target they are also shopping our food and beverage offering. yes, i think our space is set. we're not talking about flipping or divesting or investing in more space, it's how we utilize the space more definitively. and i think that what we've learned in these test markets is the role of fresh and convenience in creating trips and creating guest love as being very powerful. reformatting the space and really curating the assortment is more of what we're focused on rather than wholesale changes to macro space. mike, why do not you talk about where we are with digital? sure. we've spent very little time talking about our performance in 2016. we felt great about how we exited the year, comps up 34%, making really good progress, like we've doubled the business in the last couple of years. so why do not you talk about where we are and where we're going. look, i think, particularly in the last year the focus has been on guest experience and making our floor as a great guest experience. and while some of those investments may not have been obvious and they have pay dividends. we grew the business at almost twice the rate of the market last year. john talked about earlier how we expanded our ship from store capability which has been really, really important to as. we shipped about 1 million parcels to our guests in the two days following cyber monday. and that's really important because that is our cheapest route to the guest at home is shipping from our stores. and as we can expand that model, we can be closer to our guests physically, and in time, and we have the lead time during the holiday period to guests, as well. so all of those investments have improved the guest experience. we've almost doubled our guest satisfaction rating over the course of the year whilst we grew the business at twice the rate of the market. and we see that again going into this year. there will be a relentless focus on the guest experience going forward. all the work that john and his team are doing to reconfigure our supply chain will give us a lead time advantage and a cost advantage as we deliver more and more parcels to our guests doors. the work that mark is doing on assortment and creating exclusive product, exclusive brand for target that is not available anywhere else will be vital to our online merchandising going forward. we will always look at other ways maybe of how we might expand our assortment online, but right now we've got our sites fairly firmly focused on how we can get to guests quicker, how we can execute flawlessly, and how we can bring exclusive brand and product to our guests.
57;11;224;3;0.013392857142857142;bryan, we spent a lot of time as a leadership team looking at different alternatives. there was only one path forward. that's the path we've chosen. we've got to win best to grow. we've got to reimagine our stores, we've got to enter new neighborhoods, as we're doing with these small formats. we've got to transform our supply chain. we have to build out the digital capabilities required in this environment. we have to continue to elevate our proprietary brands. and i think most importantly, we just have to embrace the realities of this new era of retailing, and make sure that we also embrace the way consumers are shopping today. we certainly debated whether there were other options. every time we came to the table there was only one conclusion, and it's the path we've chosen to follow. we think this is the right path for our company, the right path for our shareholders, and ultimately, it's a path back to growth and an expansion of market share. we've done our homework, we've looked at this from every different angle. this was the path we kept coming back to, it's the right path for the company today. it will be the right path for the company 10 years from now.
57;12;616;9;0.01461038961038961;greg, why do not i start with the metrics, the things that we're going to be watching closest. it's going to come back to, we're going to watch the guest. how does the guest respond when we reimagine a store? how do they respond when we move into new neighborhoods? how do they respond when a new digital offerings? how do they respond as we roll out new brands? ultimately, that guest satisfaction and that guest vote is the most important one. and when they are in our stores more frequently and visiting our site more frequently, and shopping with target versus other retailers, we know we are winning. but we're going to clearly monitor the guest reaction as we remodel these next 100 stores in 2017, and we continue to accelerate with another 30 small formats. and as mark introduces new brands throughout 2017, and mike enhances our digital offering, it's going to come back to the guest reaction. and we are fighting for footsteps, we're fighting for clicks online and we're fighting for a share of mind. so for this to be a growth story, it is all about gaining market share and that starts with building greater trust, greater loyalty with our guest. so we will be watching that each and every day across these initiatives we've laid out today. yes, brian, maybe i can address the other two questions, greg. this is a multi-phase, multi-year journey, and we tried to make sure we set that expectation. we are recognizing that the environment is going to be disruptive. and we've got a ton of work still to do, although, we're not we're not starting from scratch, we're going to accelerate that pace and that investment. we are not, and we guided that in our guidance, planning for anything but low-single-digit negative declines this year. and that's what we said, it's an investment year. as we move into transition and then we will get into stability where we can sustainably, consistently drive profitable growth and market share gains, and so i want to make sure we do set that expectation appropriately. on your question with regards to how the capital allocation is being spent over, that $7 billion investment over the next three years, it's really in the three areas of brian talked about, the three big areas. the biggest ones being, obviously, as we reimagine our stores because they will still be central to our story. their roles will evolve but they will be significant investments there, as well as the new stores, supply chain and digital. and that's exactly where you would expect us to be spending that money. mike, why do not we come back to the shipping question? the reality is that in a digital business one of your biggest costs, biggest marginal costs is transportation, and it is cheaper for us to drive, or to deliver from our stores which are, as we said, about 10 miles from 75% of the population. so that last leg being very shorter makes it our cheapest option. the marginal cost of us getting product to the stores on the back of our existing network, that already -- to the distribution center is already out there -- is very, very low for us indeed. the additional cost on that last mile is very low. we also have, of course, order pickup which is probably our most economic fulfillment channel. why do not we, oliver, you have been very patient waiting, waving your arm. why do not we see if we can get him a microphone.
57;13;947;16;0.01689545934530095;oliver, let's try to unpack those questions. let me start with the last one, as we've think about the role of data science and analytics. i made the comment that three years ago this was a nascent capability for us. it's now quickly become one of the strengths of the company. we're applying that across all of our various functions. it's helping mark and his merchant team make better choices. it's certainly enabling some of the work that john is leading from a supply chain standpoint. it's influencing how we lead and manage our stores. and mike can talk about the important role it plays as we think about digital and the personalization of our communication. data science is going to play an important role across all of our functions going forward to make the company focused on the right decisions, smarter decisions, more personalized decisions. mike, why do not you talk about the role that it has played just recently as we think about digital and how we are interfacing with the guest? i think, as brian says, it's an important, it's a very important growing area for us. data sciences team out in sunnyvale we have over 40 phds who are doing nothing but thinking of clever ways to how we tune our supply chain and how we personalize the offer to our guests, particularly online. one recent improvement they've made is on some of the bottom recommendations that we give on our homepage. we've seen an eightfold improvement on conversion rate on that. we do note that as you make that experience more relevant to the guest that we will improve our sales online. it will improve our conversion rates. that's just one example. and i've seen a lot of examples in john's area around how we are improving sales forecasting and our ordering algorithms which has helped the flow of stock all the way through our supply chain. let me try to come back to your question around the consumer trends, the role of the millennial, how that takes shape over the next three to five years. i think as we look at it today, i will start with the investment we're making in our stores. and as we've looked at the outlook, as you've done the math, while we expect this continued accelerated shift to digital, stores are still going to be very important. and pick the number three years from now, the stores represent 85% or 80% or 75% of the business. i do not know? but even if they are 75% of the business three to five years from now they are still the dominant portion. what we know every time we talk to the consumer, every time we talk to the guest, they crave experience. if they're going to shop a physical store, they want it to be a great experience. we've seen the reaction to the changes we've made with visual merchandising. some of the things that mark and his team are bringing to light every day in our stores in our apparel and home categories. we have to make sure it's a great experience. if they're using our stores as a smart pickup point, we need to make sure when they come to our stores they are greeted by phenomenal team members who can quickly find their order and invite them to shop more often. so we've got to make sure that experience is critically important in our stores. we know going forward that millennial consumer that we serve, they are going to be digitally connected, and their shopping experiences are likely always going to start with that digital device. then they will choose whether they want it delivered to their front door, they want to pick it up, or they just want to make sure they know where the products are placed inside of that target store in their neighborhood. so we've got to embrace the way consumers are shopping, but we recognize when they come to a physical store they expect a great experience. when they shop online, they want it to be really easy. when they come to pick up a product at one of our 1,800 stores, we've got to make sure the product is there, we've got the right items and we invite them to enjoy the convenience that we did the shopping for them. now they can take the next 20 minutes and explore the store and discover and enjoy the merchandise that we have to offer. so physical stores will continue to be important. but we have to reimagine that store experience. today's millennial shopper does not enjoy shopping one of our tired stores that has not been touched in 10 years. but they love the reimagined stores and they give us that feedback, as we've remodeled stores in los angeles and we have reimagine stores in dallas, or as we open up new flex formats. the feedback we are receiving is sensational. and they use those flex formats, those smaller stores as places to fill in, but they're filling in two or three times a week. we are looking at it very carefully, but we know stores will be very important, but it's going to be part of our smart network where we combine the digital experience, the store experience as one and make it really easy for the guest to connect with target any time they want, any way they want in their local neighborhoods and towns.
57;14;351;9;0.02564102564102564;let's go back to pricing. let me make sure we are really clear about what we're doing and why. we spent a lot of time looking at the changes that we had made following the breach. we were very promotional. that promotional intensity has actually continued. as we go into 2017, you're going to see us get back to our roots, get back to establishing every day low pricing in those essential categories. there will be a transition period, but it's really going back to it's always worked for us in the past, and moving away from that promotional intensity, the reliance on big promotions to making sure we give our guests the confidence and trust that every day they shop in our stores for those core essential items they're getting a great value. it's a transition, there's an investment involved in that, but it's really getting back to it's made as great going in the past and really making sure that's part of what we bring going forward. we will continue to be very disciplined. as we talked about the question about capital allocation, we're still going to be company that will continue to innovate, innovation is very important. innovation is alive and well at target. but we're going to make sure we test, we learn, we validate. the innovation has to benefit our core enterprise. it has to translate to driving more traffic to our stores, more trips to our site, greater guest loyalty and engagement. innovation will be an important part of our future. we will do it, as we've done in the past, in a very disciplined way. when things do not work we will shut them down. when we need to iterate, we will continue to iterate and learn, and when we've validated the model we will step on the accelerator, as we are right now, and we will move forward quickly. i guess we've got time for one only last question. why do not we go over here. scott?
57;15;537;17;0.03165735567970205;john, you want to start with stores and then i will come back and talk about pricing. yes, just to check off really quick, cost of a remodel for a prototype, what we call a p store, $5 million, $5.5 million, a little less for lower volume stores, a little more for higher volume stores. super target, what do you think, cathy, about double? no, a little less than that. a little less than double. store execution, i would say two things about. one, on out-of-stocks, made a lot of progress. when we talked about it last year they had improved by about 40% last year, almost another 15% improvement. we've seen significant improvement in doing what we do today. the next leap in improvements in out-of-stocks in our stores will come from fundamentally changing the supply chain, which is what we talked about today. that's on course, and we will keep working on them and we'll update you as we go forward, i guess. and, scott, i will finish by talking less about price and lot more about value. we know we have to be competitively priced every day on those core essentials. but we win when we deliver a compelling value, which means a great in store experience. which means new exciting brands, which means surrounding the guest with great team members, which means a great online experience that's easy and friction free. so it can not be just about price. it has to be about value. and value is the combination of all the things we do and historically have done so well. we've got to make sure we surround the guest with a great in-store experience. the reaction we've seen as we have brought visual merchandise to like in our stores has been fantastic. we've got to continue to build compelling brands that deliver great value for the guest. we've got to surround them with a great experience, whether they're picking up an item or checking out in our stores. and that's got to translate to how we interface with the guest online. value is critically important. we think we're positioned in a way that's unique in the industry with our assortment, our in-store experience, our multi-category portfolio, the capabilities we've now built online and the changes we're making in-store. that's what gives us so much confidence that we are on the path back to growth. that it will take time, but there's going to be significant market share opportunities in front of us, and three years from now when we've reimagined stores, and we are in new neighborhoods, and we've rolled out new brands, and we've got it great new supply chain capability to complement what we've done from a digital standpoint, we will be sitting here talking about the new target, a growth company that's captured market share in this new era of retailing. so i appreciate your time and your patience today. thanks for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you in the future. so thank you.
58;1;203;5;0.024630541871921183;it's brian cornell. paul, we're very focused on executing the plan we laid out back on february 28. so you're going to continue to see us invest in store labor, making sure our standards continue to improve, and we saw very strong progress in the first quarter SEMICOLON invest in value and continue to invest in the growth of our digital business. so over the course of the year, we're committed to executing against that plan. we'll see that continue over the second, third and fourth quarter. but the plan we've laid out back in february is the plan we're going to continue to focus on executing throughout the year. our overall focus is to continue to see traffic patterns grow in our stores, improve and accelerate our digital performance. we want to make sure we're capturing market share as we did in the first quarter SEMICOLON continue to build and invest in our brands and, ultimately, improve our value proposition with the guest. so there's going to be no change to the plan we laid out in february. we're committed to executing and making those investments over the balance of the year.
58;2;266;4;0.015037593984962405;yes. so we are working to restore positive traffic and, more importantly, preference over the long term, and i think that's everything you continue to hear us say. and so over the course of q2, we're going to just keep doing what we said we would do, and that is we're going to make sure we're continuing to invest in a great experience for our guests, both online and in stores, and you'll see us doing that. mark and the team have some really exciting things coming into q2, but do not want to dismiss the positives we saw around category mix in q1 even. so i'm just going to tell you we're just in this for the long haul. we're going to keep doing what we said we'd do, and restoring positive traffic's high on our priority list. mark, did you want to talk about anything in particular with regards to food and beverage? yes. paul, in terms of promotional posture and the price/value equation, we've made some rapid changes in a number of our signature categories, but probably the key areas that we're focusing on, of course, are food and beverage and essentials. so we've been testing and iterating quickly since q4 and definitely in q1, and we'll see an evolving pattern of change and evolution on how we'll roll out both the communication to the guests and the simplification of our everyday price positioning. and you'll see that evolve more deeply in q2 and then beyond.
58;3;651;23;0.03533026113671275;simeon, let me start by really summarizing q1 performance. and certainly, i think we saw some changes in the overall macro environment, but i also saw -- we also saw very strong execution, both from a digital standpoint where we grew the business by 22%, but also meaningful changes in-store. and i think our store standards and our store execution continues to improve. i also think we showed great adaptability in the marketplace, and i'll let mark talk about some of the successes we saw in categories like apparel. but i'd highlight the efforts that we've put behind our swim business, where we started out with a #1 share position, but we saw changes in the marketplace, competitive closures, competitive exits. and as we talked about back in february, we are absolutely focused on taking advantage of market share opportunities over the next 2 or 3 years, and this was a great example where mark and his team recognized the consumer opportunity, saw a change in the competitive environment, quickly build a brand by partnering with our vendors and introduced shade & shore during the first quarter, which allowed us to take even more market share in swim. and it's a great example of the work that we're going to continue to focus on over the next few years: looking at the market, recognizing where we have competitive opportunities, where we can gain share and how we use both our digital and physical channels to meet the needs of the guests. mark, why do not you spend a few minutes just talking about the work you and the team did to take advantage of the opportunity in q1 with swim? yes. i think it's a great example of we're excited about our new brand launches as we've been testing, learning and constantly iterating to create new ideas, and they're really resonating with our guests. so as brian talked about, the story here is really one about agility and market insight. so in -- where we already had a strong #1 unit market positioning in swim, we did not rest on our laurels, similarly to our action in kids, and we looked at this market with declining players and saw an opportunity to win even further. so we looked at deep guest insights, market insights and worked really, clearly, closely with our vendor insights to create a new brand, a new paradigm and a new service level for our guests all in a very rapid period of time. launched in q1, shade & shore gained share in hearts and minds of our guests and is creating accelerated growth and real confidence for us as we build our brand portfolio. and it's important to note, as brian said, this was an omnichannel play. so we looked at both stores and online to meet the guest needs and get exemplary results. more work to do as we go into q2. but as we talked about during our prepared comments, q1, we remodeled 21 stores. we've got much more work to do over the balance of the year. we opened up 4 new small formats. we've started to make very surgical investments in value and simplify our value communication in-store and amplify that with a new advertising campaign that we call "target run. and done." so in the early stages, we're going to continue to build off of that. we want to make progress every quarter. but we recognize it's going to take time, and we're going to stay very focused, very measured against the initiatives we've laid out. and quarter by quarter, we're going to strengthen our performance, continue to drive traffic to our stores, more visits to our site and capture market share as we improve our value perception and continue to build proprietary brands within our portfolio.
58;4;280;2;0.007142857142857143;i mean, as mark and cathy have both discussed, we are making investments in value, very much focused on household essentials and food and beverage. those are going to continue over the balance of the year, and we're going to be very surgical. we're going to measure and iterate. we've already made some significant progress in simplifying our overall value and promo communication and now enhancing it with additional advertising dedicated to those core household essential items that drive trips to our stores. so you're going to continue to see that focus, not only over the balance of this year but over time. maybe, simeon, i'll add on just real quickly. so on -- let's look at the sg&a line, in particular, to give you an example. we invested more hours in the store, in store service and store experience, and obviously, we also invested in marketing. but it's being offset because of all of the work we're doing around -- in our supply chain and fulfillment. in the back rooms of our stores, we're starting to see some of the benefits there. again, we're early days in a long journey, but you are seeing some of that offset. so it does not show up as apparently on the sg&a line. and then i'd remind you to look at -- i mean, clearly, not where we want to be with sales down slightly and ebit down quite a bit more. so the investments are coming through as we said, and it's not going to show up in any given quarter. it's going to show up over the time.
58;5;290;6;0.020689655172413793;let me start. first of all, jeff has only been on board for a handful of weeks, so still in the early period of time, really trying to understand our business, assimilating to the target environment. so we want to certainly give him plenty of time to assess our business and begin to build strategies going forward. but i think it's important to recognize he's not starting from square one. over the last couple of years, we've been very focused on improving the quality of our fresh assortment. and the work that our merchandising team and our supply chain team have done, we've made significant progress in improving freshness, evolving our assortment to make sure we have more organic, natural, gluten-free items in our assortment in each and every category where we participate in food and beverage. as you've heard us talk about time and time again over the last few quarters, we made significant progress in categories like adult beverages. so jeff will build off of that work. we've certainly recognized, based on the work we've done in los angeles with the la25 remodels and additional remodel activity in the dallas-fort worth market, that as we change the in-store environment and elevate the presentation, the guest is responding very, very well. so we want to give jeff plenty of time to take his own inventory, begin to build his own strategy that will enhance the work that we've been doing over the last couple of years. and we're very confident that over time, jeff's going to build a plan that will allow us to continue to accelerate our performance in those important food and beverage categories.
58;6;83;4;0.04819277108433735;ed, we look at m&a opportunities all the time, but we look at them through a filter of what's going to really enhance our current business initiatives. so i would put out-of-the-box on the side and really think about m&a as something that's going to complement and strengthen our core strategy, help us accelerate, complement the interaction we have with the target guest, and we'll continue to look strategically at m&a opportunities over time.
58;7;256;2;0.0078125;michael, we are very focused on executing against the initiatives and investments we outlined earlier in the year. so we'll continue to iterate as we learn through our remodel experience, as we continue to open up new small formats. we learn every day as we develop new brands. but our focus remains the same, so you should not expect to see any drastic changes. and we'll continue to mature those initiatives over time. if anything, what i would say, michael, is we're accelerating. when we test and learn and validate, we accelerate our investment into that area. and so that's where we're looking across the company. when we see an opportunity to accelerate something that's working along our strategies, that's what we're doing. look, michael, over the next couple of years, you should expect us to continue to focus on reimagining our existing stores. adding new small formats that bring us into urban markets and on to college campuses, our continued investment in supply chain and technology, the support of our new brands that we'll be launching over the next 18 months, those commitments will not change. and our focus is on execution. and i think what we saw in the first quarter is a company that's making progress, we still have a long way to go, but continuing to focus on executing each and every day, both in our physical and digital channels. and that's not going to change over the next few years.
58;8;138;2;0.014492753623188406;yes. i'm happy to take that, michael. i think that -- we started work here in earnest in q4 and continuing with healthy work in q1. we actually show our indices are actually closer than the guest gives us credit for, and that's an issue for us because we know that's a bigger message that we need to convey. so we're continuing to sharpen our price and our value messaging at the same time and make sure that we move to a more regional-based pricing, localized pricing so we're more relevant to the guest and the competitive set, which is not what we're doing during '16 and we've rapidly iterated on in '17. so you'd see more of that activity and more of that benefit as we move through 2017.
58;9;271;2;0.007380073800738007;yes. so i'm happy to start, kate, and then mark can amplify as well. so on the impact that we saw coming through gross margin, as mark shared and we've shared actually for a couple of quarters, our biggest work has got to be around making sure that the value we're delivering is really clear. and it's going to take a while for our guest to give us credit for that, and so that's the work that we're going to continue to do. so while we're sharpening and making it more regionalized, you'll see that come through slightly. but the bigger effort is all of the work we're doing like the "target run. and done." campaign that we launched this last quarter and making sure that our guests recognize the value we are delivering. yes. i'd just add into that, kate. our efforts, as we've discussed, are quite surgical. so we're doing this area by area, classification by classification as an evolving transfer. and we've really begun those efforts through q1 but more in the back end as we matched to the "target run. and done." campaign. so what we're seeing here is, on the handle side, we've been clear that we've had up to 28 different handles that we've been using to resonate value across all our classifications. so rationalizing the voice and the nomenclature down is part of that. so we -- that's why we've come into q2 with an evolving position, and we'll assess its impact and its opportunity.
58;10;61;0;0.0;yes. as we said in our q2 remarks and guidance, that we expect a couple hundred million dollars of ebit decrease, and we also said that the majority of that would be in sg&a. so it's pretty -- i think it's pretty safe to assume that, that would be how i'd quantify the shift from q1 into q2.
58;11;143;1;0.006993006993006993;greg, we'll talk more about that in the second half of the year. we're spending a lot of time right now with rick gomez, who's now our chief marketing officer, really stepping back and thinking about loyalty and, importantly, as you just said, the integration of the redcard into that loyalty program. and one of the other highlights from the first quarter is the continued penetration growth of our redcard. so we recognize that's a very important asset that we need to leverage going forward, and rick and his team are working right now to think about the next phase of loyalty and how we continue to leverage the redcard to build even a stronger relationship with our guests. so you're spot on, and we'll talk about that much more in the second half of the year.
58;12;157;9;0.05732484076433121;greg, you know we do not break out monthly sales. as we said, we saw strengthening in the latter half of february, into march and april. but obviously, our comps were still down for the quarter, so we've got work to do. we're not satisfied with where we ended up. but we certainly feel good about the progress we made in the quarter and, importantly, the market share gains that we saw in very important signature categories. so we're focused on driving traffic. we are certainly committed to restoring positive comps throughout our system. but one of the other important metrics that we're going to be looking at every single quarter is how we're performing from a market share standpoint, and i feel very good about some of the market share gains that our team achieved in q1. we're going to continue to focus on market share opportunities throughout the year.
58;13;339;11;0.032448377581120944;john, there's a lot of learnings that we're bringing forward from those small stores, not only as we expand into new markets but as we think about application to our traditional stores. i think the biggest learning is, as we move into these new neighborhoods, consumers love target and they love the brand. and the response we're seeing has been really outstanding. so we feel very good about our small-format strategy. as we move into new neighborhoods, we're getting better and better at curating and localizing assortments, understanding how to operate in various markets. and we're also encouraged to see the early comp results as we lap some of the new small formats we opened up last year. so encouraging signs, and we're going to build off of that as we go forward. so we feel good about the progress we made in q1. but as a team, we're not doing high fives. we know we've got a lot of work to do. but i think it's important, as we end, to recognize, as a company, we have a very strong foundation. if you look at our results in the first quarter, we generated $16 billion of revenue. our operating income was almost $1.2 billion. we were able to invest $500 million of capex and still see a very strong return on invested capital of over 14%. and as we did that, we were able to reduce inventories by over 5%. so we know we've got a lot of additional work to do, but i think it's important to recognize we're a fundamentally sound company. we've got a very clear strategy in place, and now our focus over the balance of the next 3 years is week-to-week execution, both from a physical and digital standpoint. so we appreciate you dialing in today. we look forward to talking to you at the end of q2. and operator, that concludes our call. thank you.
59;1;139;1;0.007194244604316547;with regards to both third quarter, fourth quarter and full year remainder guidance, as we said, we'll continue to move with urgency but plan prudently. and i think that's what you should expect from us. we are finding every time we see results coming from our investments, we're choosing to continue to invest to accelerate our transformation. and so that's how i would think about the backside of the full year. with regards to the reclassification we did on the supply chain depreciation expense, we posted a great schedule, john and the team posted today to the ir website, gives you 3 full years by quarter. you can see the bottom line, it's 30 to 40 basis points a quarter change. and you would see that -- the shift from d&a to gross margin.
59;2;1;0;0.0;yes.
59;3;61;0;0.0;yes, so it is. it's related to our increasing store remodels as we accelerate some of the depreciation there. and for the full year, i was just quickly looking here, we're -- you'll see a little bit of continued pressure coming through, so it will pick up. but we'll follow up with some specifics if you need it.
59;4;206;4;0.019417475728155338;mark, why do not you provide some insight into our view on electronics? yes. thanks, chris. i think, firstly, just on the apple comments, they were not just driven by tablet. they were all driven across the board in categories. and we had really strong showing in q2 on the iwatch, which we worked with apple on clearly. and we have a lot in our plans to q3 and q4 with potential new launches as i've outlined. so we think that there's still room for growth and continuing the trend. in terms of nintendo switch, we worked really closely with those guys as well to develop not only a product but a marketing campaign that the guests really responded to. and so we've been able to secure inventory and a plan all through to the fourth quarter, so feeling positive about sustaining a trend there. and chris, i think it's consistent with our focus on bringing newness to the guest, not only in electronics but through our assortment. and i think mark and his team have done a terrific job of working with our vendors and also building own-brands that bring excitement and newness to our guests each and every day.
59;5;101;1;0.009900990099009901;so chris, as we've said, we know that we've got a multiyear journey around the supply chain transformation, which will help that working capital continue to come through the business. and we want to just make sure we keep making that progress through time, so not going to commit longer term just yet as we -- it's really going to be associated with a lot of the supply chain transformation. on the increase in capex next year, again we're not giving all of next year guidance but thought important to signal where we were going with our capex.
59;6;170;4;0.023529411764705882;david, i would tell you it's a combination of both. and overall, we're very focused on improving the guest experience, whether they're shopping in store or online, making sure that we deepen the relationship with existing and new guests. and we are very pleased with the traffic increases we saw during the quarter. we're honestly very excited about the work that mark and his team are doing around bringing new brands to our guests. and we recognize that to move forward and to continue to execute, we've got to continue to make sure we're providing fulfillment options that our guests are looking for today. so as john talked about during our prepared comments, we're very focused right now on testing and expanding different fulfillment options. we've seen some very positive responses to things like target restock. and we're going to continue to ensure that we could meet the needs of our guests no matter how they want to shop at target.
59;7;278;2;0.007194244604316547;it's a very important question. and i'm going to turn it over to john here to build on that. but we're trying to make sure we are very, very focused right now and that we have the guest in mind first, that the initiatives that we're bringing forward are guest-centered. but importantly, that we have the right focus on execution each and every day. and i think what we saw in the second quarter is a by-product of our focus on execution each and every day in our stores, online, in our supply chain. and i think you're starting to see that focus really connect with the guests. yes, i think the only thing i'd add, you're 100% right about the focus. i think the key challenge there for us is to continue to take work that is not guest-facing out of the store. and guest-facing work there is, like we said, the investments we're making in food and beverage, in beauty, in visual merchandising. that includes things like order pickup and shipping from the store. but there are opportunities everywhere else to pull work out of the store. and i think the stores' teams have done a great job optimizing within the box. we need to continue to optimize upstream to help them take work out. and that's a lot of the testing we're doing today. now i did not talk a lot about it, but we have test going on in multiple parts of the company focused on taking work out of the store, so they can be focused on the guest.
59;8;361;10;0.027700831024930747;so robbie, there's 4 or 5 different questions there. and we'll try to unbundle each of them. but as mark talked about during his prepared comments, during the second quarter, we saw very strong market share growth across a number of categories. we continue to see share growth in apparel, in home, in hardlines. and one of the things that, i think, we felt best about in the quarter, and it's a by-product of the work we've done from a promote standpoint as we continue to see our businesses in essentials shift back to regular-priced sales and the impact of our new marketing and advertising campaign, the target run and done campaign, which has driven really positive reaction from the guests and accelerated our business in essentials. so that was a real big highlight for us in the second quarter. and we've talked about this before. we're at our best when we balance both style and household essentials. and you're seeing that balance come to play in the second quarter. and we certainly are going to continue that over the balance of the year and into 2018. so it was a period of time where we feel good about the progress we're making as we pick up market share in many of our signature and style categories. we've seen growth in our essentials businesses. and we'll build off of that as we go into the balance of 2017 and '18. sorry, robbie, around cartwheel. cartwheel remains a really viable promotional vehicle and guest engagement tool for us. and what we're doing though, in the simplification of our pricing message and creating great priced-right daily items, is we're using cartwheel, but we're reducing the amount of stacking that's coming in. and that's really helping us to clarify and simplify our message to guests about what true everyday value is as well as what's an exceptional promotion. so the rescoping of that has been tremendous so far. and really, our regular business is shining and our promotional business is rescoped in a great way.
59;9;2;0;0.0;obviously not.
59;10;224;7;0.03125;yes. why do not we turn it over to mark to talk about both food and what we saw during that prime period? thanks, bob. i think that we outlined in our q1 comment around the emergence of our strategy and that we're going to be on a journey of implementation as jeff burt joined us in the business. and jeff has already come in and begun start testing and iterating new ideas and concepts on top of our strategies that are creating growth vehicles, so we're excited about that. the new people entering our business are just creating new strength against those strategic intents. so firstly, liz nordlie will add value to our own brand growth potential there and strengthen our efforts there as well as mark kenny, really with his expertise in general grocery but specifically in the convenient meal area and in bakery, et cetera. i mean, that is part of our ongoing strategic intent to strengthen and focus there. so these are key investments in our strategy and in our team, balancing them against existing talent. in regards to your query around prime, we're really happy to see ongoing trends maintained during prime period. and we had positive comps and a really strong growth in regular price business continuing through those days both in-store and online.
59;11;121;2;0.01652892561983471;yes. thanks, peter. so let me start with pet. we announced this month the addition of blue buffalo to our assortment, which is the #1 brand in the u.s. and a really core assortment get. and so excited to add that into our mix, and we already have a lot of data from our guests who suggested they wanted to see that at target. we also embarked on an agreement with barkbox. so really refocusing our accessory and our total assortment of doing business inside pet. so an exciting uptick there because that brings further guest trips and conversion. around the food and beverage area, in terms of general assortment, we're still working on there and more to follow.
59;12;77;3;0.03896103896103896;i think that we've talked openly about a roster of more than 12 brands that we'll be bringing to life over a period of time. we've begun that journey. that continues into 2018. it highlights definitely the signature areas, but the strength, providing differentiation, exclusivity and therefore, preference that target through this is applicable to many different areas. so we're looking at all areas and opportunities, and we have some plans in place.
59;13;146;3;0.02054794520547945;i think any time you focus on just one slice of the total fulfillment, you lose picture for the whole thing, right? we're trying to optimize the total economics for target. and those economics include investments, capital investments we might otherwise have to make if we do not utilize the existing assets. so i think we can point to any one slice and say, "this one is going to be better or worse." but again, we're optimizing total economic picture. and i'd have you think about that. i think the remodels, where they will really help us, and it's in conjunction with us taking inventory out of the backroom, is our ability to optimize that backroom more efficiently to drive more productivity as we ship from the store. and so that's the real opportunity as we go through the remodel cycle.
59;14;29;0;0.0;for sure. and in conjunction with operating changes to reduce inventory, like i was talking about earlier, and take work out of that -- other work out of the store.
59;15;129;1;0.007751937984496124;as you saw in the quarter, we are seeing the continued investment in both sg&a as well as gross margin. we also though are working really hard to make sure we can offset with efficiencies throughout the organization, where appropriate. and so you're seeing that -- you saw it come through in sg&a and in gross margin this first -- the second quarter, you saw in the first quarter as well to do that. so where we see the investments get the return that we expect and the results we expect, we're investing faster and heavier to accelerate the transformation. so i would say we're on path to what we said we would do. and you're seeing it come through in both q1 and 2.
59;16;371;7;0.018867924528301886;yes. okay, i'll take that one. so our promotional efforts are really a roll through the quarter event. and we began them in first quarter in april. and our second round of taking key items that comprise our guest basket and focusing on priced-right daily items really took hold and then second wave by end of july. the next round of that is through october. and that's when we'll be coming together to have a more concise in-store marketing campaign and regular cadence of new brands to the guest to communicate value. so we think at that point that we have a strong base to maintain. and this is why in half 2, we've been prudent in how we forecasted our sales and margins based on also unit growth initially. we see trip growth initially. and we need to see that dollar growth balance out over time. but we know that we've been patient with that, hence some of our earlier discussions at the start of the year are about investing ahead of the curve. kate, i think promotions, along with many of the other things we've talked about, are still obviously in the early stages. now we're excited about the results that we've seen with remodels. but we have hundreds of stores in front of us. we've seen great responses in some of our small formats. but again, we'll open up dozens of additional stores over the next couple of years. the brands that we've launched have been well received. but we're really just getting into the heart of the brand launches as we go into the back half of '17 and '18 as well as the pricing and promo work. so we're very pleased with the progress. we know we've got much more work in front of us. but we thought today would be a great chance to give you a progress report and give you a sense for the amount of work and the scope of work that's taking place within target. so that concludes our second quarter 2017 earnings call. i really appreciate all of you participating, so thank you.
60;1;312;13;0.041666666666666664;david, i think sitting here today, we feel very confident that we're making very good progress against the plans that we set out earlier this year. if i think about the state of our business today, we're seeing a great response to the 8 new brands that we've launched as we've remodeled now over 100 stores, which we continue to see the list that we're projecting of 2% to 4%. we've seen a tremendous response to our new small formats that we've been opening up in new neighborhoods and on college campuses. and as you know, we opened up a number of new stores in this last quarter. and whether it was the results we've seen in herald square or all the way out in hawaii, the guests have responded very, very well. we continue to see very strong performance from a digital standpoint, outpacing industry by a 2x factor. and during the quarter again, we saw very strong digital growth. and that's been underpinned by the progress we've made from a digital fulfillment standpoint and some of the things that john talked about during his prepared remarks. so sitting here today, i think we're making great progress, and i think we'll continue to see that progress extend into the fourth quarter. so we entered the quarter with a lot of confidence. we know there's a lot of business that has to be done, and we're off to a very good start led by the reaction into hearth and hand as well as some of the other initiatives that are in place. so i think we're taking the right approach, but we entered the quarter with a lot of confidence and making a lot of progress against literally every initiative that we set forth earlier this year.
60;2;78;7;0.08974358974358974;david, we do not expect to see any deterioration in the progress that we've been making throughout the year. so again, i think we entered the fourth quarter highly confident and in a very strong position with our stores performing incredibly well, great merchandise, a terrific marketing campaign, great digital capabilities and an expanded suite of digital fulfillment capabilities. so we feel very good about how the entire business is set to perform in the fourth quarter.
60;3;137;6;0.043795620437956206;peter, i think mark and his team have made tremendous progress over the course of the year. and as we've talked about a number of times now, we're seeing a significant shift of our business towards everyday regular price, which is really important over the long term. so we're going to continue to make sure that we're committed to offering great value, that we're priced right daily, and during the fourth quarter, we'll provide exciting promotions to support those items that we know our guests are going to be interested in shopping for at target. so it's an ongoing commitment. we want to make sure we deliver great value across the season. and we're going to make sure that we couple that with exciting promotions in the fourth quarter.
60;4;219;3;0.0136986301369863;well, i think, clearly, as we do more fulfillment out of the store, we will add labor to support that. i think we've said since february, we're going to invest in the labor in our stores, invest in training, invest in having experts in the store, invest in having people on the sales floor and changing the operating model for those stores. so that's an important part of what we're doing. almost separately and independently, we're building teams that -- so that we do not take hours away from everything else we're doing that are handling the fulfillment in the back room. so it's really a question of the operating model in the store that's evolving. and we feel really good about utilizing the stores, they're the closest, fastest and cheapest way to get merchandise to our guests. they have significant capabilities now. we're doing same-day, next-day, 2-day pick up, drive up, all kinds of ways to meet the guests' needs, and i think that's the important factor, all centered around using the store as the hub. and we think it's a highly efficient way to use our assets, and we have great teams that can meet the capabilities that we need for our guests.
60;5;184;6;0.03260869565217391;ed, again, as we entered this season, i think we're in much a stronger position. john underscored the fact that we've got an expanded array of digital fulfillment capabilities. mark's talked about the progress we've made from both a brand standpoint but also a value standpoint. i think we continue to enhance our digital capabilities. so i think we entered this season in a much stronger position. and i think what's really important to recognize is the investments we've made in our team and our stores puts us in a very strong position as we enter the fourth quarter. so i feel great about the investments we've made in wages, in hours, in seasonal hiring. and i think our stores are going to drive both our digital business and our store business throughout the fourth quarter. so i think we entered the season in a very different position versus last year. and i think that's reflected in the start that we've seen to the season and the approach we're taking throughout the fourth quarter.
60;6;199;3;0.01507537688442211;well, ed, we're hopeful that you'll join us in march for next year's financial community day. obviously, we're not going to provide 2018 guidance today. but i'll give you a preview. you're going to hear us talk about many of the same things we've been talking about this year: our commitment to the store experience and continuing to remodel stores across the country, our commitment to opening up new small formats in new neighborhoods and on college campuses, our continued commitment to digital, our commitment to enhancing our fulfillment capabilities, our continued commitment to new brands and building our proprietary fleet of brands and an ongoing commitment to value. and all of that will be underscored by our commitment to our team. so we'll go through that in much more detail in march. but as a preview, we're going to be talking about the exact same suite of initiatives next year that we've been talking about this year. we feel great about the progress. our strategy is working. each one of those initiatives is on track or ahead of schedule, and we expect to accelerate those initiatives in 2018.
60;7;207;3;0.014492753623188406;sure, chris. why do not we let mark walk you through how we're approaching our investments in essentials? chris, yes, let me share with you. so we've been sharing this year that we took a journey in terms of ensuring we're priced right daily and that we were able to create and communicate to our guests the right value. and that started in april of this year and we completed that through the end of the third quarter. what we've seen with that is we had an expectation that's not an immediate just that (inaudible) response we need to build ongoing, deeper trust with the guests and get them to connect with that priced right daily ethos, and we've seen a really fast reaction, a positive reaction to that. so we're creating in trips and traffic within our adjustment on -- to be priced right daily. and as a result, we've seen an increase in our unit velocity. we fully expected and baked in some of the short-term sales deflation that we would see as a result. but we're starting to see that equal out, and we expect that stability to continue through the fourth quarter into 2018.
60;8;64;2;0.03125;chris, i think that's exactly what we're saying, continued investment across multiple categories. and as mark talked about, the first thing we see is an increase in units, an increase in trips and ultimately that's going to drive positive comps over time. so i think the efforts are paying off relatively quickly, and we feel really good about the guest response.
60;9;215;2;0.009302325581395349;i'll start with the in-stock question. i think, bob, we talked about in-stocks last year in february. it's a journey for us, we know. i think we've made a lot of progress in in-stocks given our current capabilities. but we also said, in order to really solve the problem, we need to fix some fundamental capabilities in our supply chain around speed, reliability, inventory placement. and that's where we're on the journey. so the inventory increase at the end of q3, as mark said, more related to us being sure we're ready for the fourth quarter in categories like electronics, hearth and hand, where we took positions, intentional inventory positions to increase inventories in advance of the fourth quarter. less to do with our management of day-to-day in-stocks/out-of-stocks. we continue to work on those. and as i said, there is the short term, working within our current capabilities and in the longer term solve that comes as we continue to improve our overall supply chain capabilities. your second question, i'm not entirely clear, bob, on where your -- maybe you could clarify how -- your question, the store labor related to fulfillment, i'm not -- i did not quite understand it.
60;10;126;4;0.031746031746031744;yes, i would not compare it to third quarter. compared to last year, we are doing more fulfillment in-store. as we said, we think that's the most cost-effective way given the total p&l. so shipping plus store labor, we think that's the most cost-effective way to do it. compared to last year, we saw significant spikes last year near the end of the quarter, approaching 80% fulfillment. and i would say, when you get into that 80% range, what really goes up is store pickup, and we'll take that model all day long, highly efficient for us, highly profitable from a digital perspective. so when our mix gets that high in store, we actually like the economics a lot.
60;11;260;6;0.023076923076923078;matt, this is cathy. i think i would look at it the way we -- we have all year been approaching it, which is, we're trying to be prudent as we plan into the fourth quarter. we're excited about what we've seen so far, but it's early in a very important quarter. the pressure that we are anticipating is around digital fulfillment as well as all the work we continue to do around value, and we're offsetting that with cost savings continuing into the fourth quarter. so i would look at it as just doing what we said we would do all year long, which is be prudent, plan appropriately and make sure that we set the business up for success. matt, i'd only build on a couple of comments that cathy made. one, we feel very good about the performance of our own brands and from a gross margin standpoint, both short term and long term, that's going to be very beneficial to our mix. two, we are clearly investing in digital and digital capabilities and expect that we're going to continue to see strong digital growth in the fourth quarter. so it is the mix of our business that really makes sure that our gross margin returns stay on track. but the work that mark and his team have done with our own brands and the results that we're seeing across our 8 new brands is very beneficial, both short term and long term, to our gross margin rate performance.
60;12;281;7;0.02491103202846975;we are really excited about some of the capabilities we're adding to redcard coming into this fourth quarter. i have to tell you, i'm one of the early users for our wallet application and it is phenomenally fast and convenient and a great experience for the guests. so as we continue to ramp up some exclusives around redcard, our guests are responding. we're seeing additional capabilities come into redcard holders, our best guest, into the fourth quarter. so i would expect that we'll see that trend continue to be favorable. yes, matt, i think we also recognize that as a by-product of the investments we have been making in our stores, our plans moving into new neighborhoods, we're bringing in new guests to target. so over time, we certainly want to convert them to redcard holders. but i think what we're seeing is, as we move into new catchments, these are new guests that are shopping at target. over time, they'll start adopting our redcard. i think our new brands are bringing new guests into our stores, and i think the focus that we placed around value is also attracting a new shopper. so over time that provides us tremendous opportunities to continue to build redcard penetration. and one of the metrics that we have not talked about on the call is the fact that traffic was up 1.4% as existing guests are shopping more often, but it also is new guests coming to our stores and our site. so over time, those are potential new prospects for redcard. and we certainly expect to see that conversion as we go into 2018.
60;13;360;5;0.013888888888888888;robbie, why do not we let john start by talking about that pickup shopper and then we'll come back to our guidance for the quarter. i might start up with the drive up shopper there. i think our guest survey scores there, nps scores are, frankly, off the charts. we see a high utility. it's mom with 2 kids in the back, right? a core target shopper who just does not -- it's raining outside and does not want to get out of the car. so we've seen very, very high scores there. the baskets are mixed as you'd imagine, right? sometimes they're larger, sometimes it's only one thing. and the same is very true for pickup in store, driven by -- it can be driven by promotional cadence, it can be driven by convenience. there's lots of different reasons people choose that option and so the basket varies. there's nothing really to glean from that other than for both of them, we see very high nps scores for our guests, which is the most important thing from our perspective. robbie, why do not i clear up the question around guidance for the quarter and, really, i'll focus on the full year. i think our fourth quarter guidance is a reflection of the performance we've been delivering throughout the year. and i'll go back and note as cathy discussed, our full year guidance is up $0.50. i'll do the math for it. that's $500 million of improvement versus our original guidance. so we certainly approach the fourth quarter with a level of balance and conservatism, but feel good about the momentum we have. and we think the performance we've been delivering throughout the year will be reflected in our fourth quarter. so we feel confident, we're making good progress, there's a lot of business still to be done in the fourth quarter. and i think our range of comp of flat to 2 and the approach we're taking from an eps standpoint just reflects the approach we've been taking throughout the year.
60;14;373;16;0.04289544235924933;yes, i'll let john talk about the profitability component. but kate, i think one of the great things about our strategy is the important role our stores play. and as we think about drive up, we think about same day, those are going to be enabled by the 1,800 stores that are in neighborhoods around the country. so we should be able to continue to expand that over time and meet the needs of our guests no matter where they live and which store they shop in. and on your question about profitability, clearly the closer we are to the store, the better we like it. when a guest comes in and picks it off the shelf, great. only slightly disadvantaged to that would be pickup or drive up because there is one more touch. but really, again, economically, a great, great solution for us. as we get into shipping, same-day delivery is more expensive, there's no question about that. and at least today, our guest research leads us to believe, guests understand that. they want it priced right, they want the convenience and they understand there may be a charge to get it to them at the time they want it during that day, and we've seen that in the 4 stores in new york, no push back at all on the delivery charge. and the great thing is, we see the baskets, as i said, 6x to 9x larger. so that ends up being a highly, highly profitable transaction for us. and so there are markets where that will work, that type of transaction will work really well. there are other markets were, as you said, there will be standard 2-day shipping. and there, we're working hard to reduce costs throughout that shipping while improving the speed. so that's on our team so that the guest gets the great service and we make that a great economic transaction for target as well. but we feel good about our ability to make it work. so with that, operator, that concludes our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. i want to thank everybody for participating and wish everyone a happy holiday season. so thank you.
