Presentation

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second-quarter 2014 earnings call. (Operator Instructions). We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So this is Jamie and I am going to start if you don't mind. I know some of you have many questions on my recent cancer diagnosis so I would like to make a few comments on that so we can then hopefully focus on the reason for our call which is our quarterly earnings and the results of the Company.
First, I want to thank everybody for their calls, their notes, their good wishes. It does mean a lot to me and my family. To start with, I feel great. I think I have some of the best doctors in the world and I will be receiving the best treatment. I am very fortunate that this is curable.
To recap, we have already talked about and what my doctors have told me about, we caught it early, it is confined to the original site in the adjacent lymph nodes in the right side of my neck. It is isolated to that specific area. The cancer has not spread. Importantly, with all the tests they have done there is no evidence of cancer anywhere else in my body and it is curable with radiation and chemotherapy which I would put down as fairly standard for this kind of cancer and the prognosis is excellent.
The Board will be fully briefed on my condition and if they and I feel that it is necessary to make additional disclosures we will do that but I really do think the next disclosure I am going to make will be in about seven or eight weeks saying the therapy is over, I am feeling better and the prognosis is excellent.
My doctors have finalized their treatment plans with me over the last several days though I do plan as I go through treatment to be actively involved in managing our business. I've also been told that after the seven-week treatment period I have been advised to take rest, that does not mean that I won't work, they just simply say that rest and recuperation should come before other things which by the way is the exact same advice I give my friends, my family and anyone working at JPMorgan or any one of you who came down with something like this.
So I do plan to work. I do plan to read. I will be accessible.
Succession planning, that is why it is here, is exactly as it was before. There is no change whatsoever. The Board has plans in place and they talk about all the time for various scenarios and we are fortunate enough to have an exceptional group of executives. You know them all. I hope you take the time to tell some of the reporters the quality -- I was told people there is a book in every body and the book on a lot of the management team here is brains, ethics, work ethic, partnering, knowledge, experience, high-quality people and I actually think that many of them could run a major financial company and my Board feels the same way.
Importantly the Board has been fully engaged with the senior leaders the whole time they have been at this Company. I also want to point out that we have a standing protocol in place before this, during this, and after this. We think it is simply good governance that if I am unreachable for any reason -- remember I took a three-week trip to Asia. So if for a minute, an hour, a day or a week that they are to contact our lead director who will get them the consent, the advice and a help that they need so that the Company continues to go on as usual.
So I will stop there and hand it off to Marianne who will take you through the earnings of the Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. I am going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting then on page 1, the firm delivered strong performance this quarter with net income of $6 billion on revenues of over $25 billion; EPS of $1.46 and a return on tangible common equity of over 14%. The reported results as you can see on the page includes approximately $670 million of firmwide legal expense. In addition to that item, there were a number of other smaller items, some positive, some negative in the results, most notably $350 million of consumer reserve releases. And we estimate our core performance for the quarter was also $6 billion plus or minus which is among the best we have ever had which is a very good result especially given the challenging environment for markets and mortgage which persisted during the second quarter and interest rates remaining low and the cost of control high.
Importantly in the firm's performance this quarter, we are releasing the benefit of our diversified earnings profile as well as the focus on investing and growing the underlying performance drivers in each of our businesses which has translated into net income growth and operating leverage in a number of businesses most notably CBB, Commercial Banking and Asset Management.
We also continued to make significant progress against our capital targets with a CET1 ratio of 9.8%, firmwide and bank supplementary leverage ratios of 5.4% and 5.6% respectively, and remaining compliant with liquidity requirements all while returning $3 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter with gross share repurchases of $1.5 billion.
Core loan growth was strong for the quarter at 4% and 8% up year on year with encouraging signs across our businesses. And NII was up slightly this quarter on a relatively flat core NIM.
Turning to page 2, before getting into each of the businesses, a couple of comments here. You can see circled the adjusted expense for the quarter was $14.8 billion for an adjusted overhead ratio of 58%. This number does obviously exclude legal expense but of note, it includes a little less than $300 million of expenses related to business simplification which we consider to be non-core.
Including lower incentive compensation on lower CIB revenues for the first half, we have updated our adjusted full-year expense guidance to be $58 billion plus or minus with a caveat that obviously the final number will depend on performance-related compensation for the full year.
We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses and operating as efficiently as possible across our businesses. You can also see on the page the returns generated this quarter by each of our businesses which is driving strong performance of the firm overall.
Moving on to page 3, as I said, the firm reported a CET1 ratio of 9.8%, up from 9.6% last quarter as we increased our common equity Tier 1 capital base by over $4 billion principally through net retained earnings. Risk-weighted assets were broadly flat in the quarter with higher operational risk RWA and some growth largely offset by lower market and credit risk RWA reflecting increased model usage and portfolio runoff. We are still on track to reach 10% plus CET1 ratio by the end of the year as previously guided.
The lower of our two transitional measures and you will recall we exited Basel III Parallel at the beginning of the quarter so the lower of our two transitional measures which is technically the measure effective this quarter under the common floor is the Basel III Advanced transitional ratio which is also at 9.8%. And what isn't on the page but for your information, the fully phased in standardized ratio is 10.1%.
We continue to make good progress on our leverage ratios this quarter. Both the firm and the bank SLR improved quarter over quarter by about 30 basis points so we are obviously within sight of our 5.5% target for the firm. And at 5.6% for the bank, we do have a clear path to our 6% plus target.
Finally on this page, we continue to have a very strong liquidity position and remain in compliance with LCR.
Moving on to the businesses starting on page 4 Consumer & Community Banking. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.4 billion of revenue and an ROE of 19%. We continue to see excellent growth in the underlying business drivers with average deposits up 9% in CBB, our active mobile customers up 23%, credit card sales volume of 12%, client investment assets up 19% and crossing the $200 billion mark. And according to J.D. Power, we continue to be ranked number one in overall customer satisfaction as well as for mortgage originations among large banks and number one in three of four regions for small business banking customer satisfaction.
Finally across CCB, we expect to exceed our headcount reductions outlined at Investor Day.
Turning to page 5, Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $894 million, up a significant 28% year on year on net revenue of $4.6 billion with an ROE of 33%. While we do continue to see some pressure on deposit margins, this continues to be more than offset by strong growth in deposit balances, the 9% I just mentioned among the highest in the industry. This deposit growth is driven by strong household growth and record customer retention. We added 800,000 net households since last year as our new branches continue to mature.
On the noninterest revenue side, we continue to see strong year over year growth in both debit and investment revenues as we deepen relationships with customers and as we see our Global Wealth Management strategy play out with more affluent customers.
In Business Banking, the momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued. We had record originations up 46% year on year and 27% over last quarter back to levels that we last saw in 2012. We believe that this reflects a combination of improving industry trends driven by business optimism generally continuing to trend higher, and improving banker performance especially in our expansion markets where we have been investing and as our positive strategies mature.
Our pipeline continues to strengthen. 2Q 2014 was the highest level since 2012 and we do expect this positive momentum and strong growth year-over-year to continue in the second half of the year.
Expense is flat year on year with efficiency gains in the branches being offset by higher cost of controls that we have spoken about. But it was down quarter on quarter as cost of investments in controls are moderating.
Turning to page 6 and Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $700 million for the quarter with an ROE of 16%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging and mortgage production pretax income excluding repurchase was a negative $74 million for the quarter a little (technical difficulty) of our guidance reflecting higher revenue margin on a mix shift towards retail loans and higher pipeline as well as good progress made in the quarter to reduce our fixed expenses.
At this point market dependent, we expect the third-quarter results to be broadly similar to the second quarter, a small negative.
Originations of $17 billion were flat quarter on quarter and down 66% year on year which is in a market that we estimate was seasonally up 25% quarter on quarter which shows that we continued to lose some share. Key drivers behind the share loss were the continuation of our strategy to reduce our participation in lower FICO and higher LTV government loans as well as the burnout of HARP. In addition, we did lose some share in other conventional resulting from price competition as we maintained discipline regarding pricing to our required returns.
Mortgage production benefited in the quarter from a repurchase reserve release, a positive $137 million driven primarily by refinements in expectations regarding certain residual risks following the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Onto servicing, net servicing-related revenue of $693 million is down slightly quarter on quarter but is higher than guidance due primarily to higher gains on [SIO] securities and Ginnie Mae loan sales. While we do expect to continue to benefit from both during the second half of the year to a lesser extent than the first and these gains can be lumpy. So we expect servicing revenue to decline in the third quarter to $600 million plus or minus and servicing expenses are modestly down quarter on quarter.
MSR Risk Management was a net gain this quarter of $338 million driven by a $220 million positive model update on slower prepayment speeds which remember, we would have earned otherwise over time through model [miss] and which reflects the impact of the burnout on HARP as well as I mentioned.
On real estate portfolios concentrating on credit, we see net charge-offs for the quarter of $111 million and reserve releases of $300 million in the purchase credit impaired portfolio reflecting actual and expected appreciation in home prices. There were no reserve releases in the quarter for the non-credit impaired portfolio although favorable loss and delinquency trends do continue.
We do expect to see reserve releases in NCI over the next couple of years in total between $500 million and $1 billion as the credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve. And lastly on real estate portfolios in the quarter, we added $5 billion of loans to the portfolio.
Finally, mortgage headcount was down approximately 5000 year to date and we expect to exceed our Investor Day target of approximately 6000 for the full year of 2014.
Turning to page 7, Card, Merchant Services & Auto. Net income of $840 million, down 33% year on year were down 11% excluding reserve releases delivering an ROE of 18%. While down on declining reserve releases, the results do reflect strong underlying metrics. Sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 25th consecutive quarter primarily due to strong sales engagement of new customers. Our new acquisition vintages are performing exceptionally well.
In merchant services, we have seen strong volume and transaction growth year-over-year with our signed sales volume gaining momentum reflecting several large account wins in the quarter. Strong revenue of $4.6 billion was up slightly quarter on quarter but down 3% year on year and when you think about the year-on-year decline, we have reached the point where spread compression and strong fee growth offsets. So the net decline is driven by higher amortization of customer acquisition costs and the absence of fees related to discontinued products in 2013.
Expense is up 8% quarter on quarter and 7% year on year driven by controls, the timing of marketing investments and this quarter includes $125 million of the legal expense I talked about.
Moving on to credit, losses continue to improve albeit at a slower pace and the card net charge-off rate has remained very low at 288 basis points and we released $50 million of student lending reserves in the quarter.
Card outstandings momentum has shifted. End of period outstandings grew by $1.8 billion or 1.5% year over year with growth coming across our product sets fueled by the strong sales performance I highlighted. Core growth is now outpacing runoff and we acquired over 2 million new accounts in the quarter, up 40% year on year.
Before we move on, a few words on auto. New vehicle sales continued to grow year on year and the June SAR results reached the highest level since 2006. We have seen the 11th straight quarter of loan and lease growth as our partners continue to outpace the general market which remains competitive. The auto pipeline remains healthy, consistent with the recovery in the auto market.
Moving on to slide 8 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of $9 billion and an ROE of 13%. In banking, total revenue was $3.1 billion, down 2% year on year. IB fees, $1.8 billion, up 3%. We maintained our number one ranking in global IB fees per Dealogic, and widened the gap to number two.
Revenue growth was driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees and while debt underwriting fees were lower, we had strong relative performance for the quarter. The IB pipeline remains solid with an environment supportive of M&A and a large diversified IPO backlog.
Treasury Services revenue of $1 billion was in line with our guidance, down 4% year on year driven by lower trade finance revenue and the impact of business simplification. Lending revenue was down $80 million year on year driven by lower NII but was up 5% quarter over quarter.
Moving onto markets and investor services, reported markets revenue was down 14% year on year versus our guidance of 20% plus or minus with FIC down 15% and equities revenue down 10%. Included in these results are gains of over $100 million on the sale of market partner shares post-IPO. Excluding this, our results would have been down 15% year-on-year. In FIC the decline was driven broadly across macro products and in commodities with volatility remaining very low and with the exception of a few more active weeks in June, volumes also low. In equities, the decline was driven by derivatives while client volumes are highly correlated to volatility levels.
In terms of outlook for the coming quarter and the second half, June was a better month somewhat broadly but that momentum has not continued into July so far and volatility remains very low across products. As such it is our [central case] that the third-quarter will face a similar environment through the first half of 2014 and we expect normal seasonal trends.
Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 5% year on year primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits and higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. AUC reached a record $21.7 trillion, up 14% year on year.
Quarter on quarter, revenue was up on seasonality in a depository receipt and agent lending businesses.
Moving on to the expense, total expense was up 6% year on year. Compensation expense was down 8% with a comp to revenue ratio for the quarter of 31% and we expect a full-year comps revenue ratio to likely end between 30% and 35% rather than at the low end of the range.
Non-compensation expense was up year on year by 20% with the quarter including over $300 million of legal expense and a little less than $300 million of non-core expenses associated with business simplification I mentioned earlier.
Moving onto page 9 and the Commercial Bank, we had very good earnings in the Commercial Bank this quarter with net income up 6% from last year and an ROE 19%. We saw strong performance on key underlying business drivers driving revenue of $1.7 billion, up 3% sequentially with gross IB fees up 25% year on year driving the first half of the year to a record. And on higher NII driven by higher loan volumes and day counts.
We added $3.3 billion of loans in the quarter with growth across the board in all of our businesses. Our consistent growth in real estate continued with loans up 2% in the quarter and 14% in the year. After a flat start to the year we are happy to see C&I growth of 3% in the quarter in line with the industry. Revolver utilization picked up 3 percentage points versus the end of last year. Pipelines are up which should be supportive for trends in the second half of the year.
The environment remains competitive but stable driving some continued spread compression and we continue to see some pricing pressure to varying degrees in the businesses.
Expense was relatively flat quarter on quarter but higher than last year reflecting our commitment to the regulatory and control agenda. Expect expenses for the business of approximately $700 million in the third quarter. Our credit performance remains exceptional with net recoveries in the quarter.
Moving on to page 10 and Asset Management. An excellent quarter in Asset Management with net income of $552 million up 10% year on year and 25% quarter on quarter with a 25% ROE and a 30% pretax margin hitting our through the cycle targets. For the full year, these ratios will be slightly lower as the business continues to invest in both infrastructure and control as well as select front office hiring but we are on track to deliver at or through the cycle target for the full year of 2015.
Revenue of $3 billion was up 8% year on year reflecting an increase in management fees driven by record long-term net inflows of $34 billion for the quarter including the benefit of a large institutional fixed income mandate. This marks the 21st consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows driving AUM of $1.7 trillion, up 16% year on year and we continue to expect strong flows going forward.
Looking at the mix of flows by product, we saw continued strength in our multi-asset and alternative flows in line with our best quarter. In fixed income, we had our strongest quarter of flows ever and our best quarter in over a year excluding the large mandates I mentioned. And lastly despite solid equity market performance in the quarter, flows did not follow as investors showed hesitance to add to their positions at these levels.
Expense of $2.1 billion was up 9% from a year ago primarily driven by higher cost of controls and investment in growth. Lastly in Banking, we reported solid performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances surpassed the $100 billion mark, up 17% year on year and 4% quarter over quarter with growth coming from both our US and our international markets. We continue to see a solid pipeline for loan demand for the remainder of the year and average deposits were also up year over year by 8% but seasonally down 1% sequentially.
Moving on to page 11 and Corporate/Private Equity. Private Equity overall had a flattish result driven by net gains on dispositions partially offset by unrealized losses and our Private Equity portfolio declined by approximately $1 billion. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $46 million. NII was a negative $10 million, better by $80 million quarter on quarter driven by higher investment securities balances and the continued benefit of higher reinvestment yields. In the quarter we deployed $27 billion in gross new investments.
Finally on this page, other corporate. Net income was over $400 million. Included in the results are tax-related benefits of over $200 million and as I mentioned earlier, we reported firmwide legal expense pretax of $670 million for the quarter of which $227 million is here in other corporate.
Moving on to outlook on page 12, we did receive positive feedback from our most recent guidance disclosure in the 10-Q so we have replicated it and updated it here. A few final comments. It is too early for us to give specific guidance for markets revenues but we do expect the current environment to persist into the third quarter and for the second half and also to experience normal seasonal trends.
For the third-quarter, we generally expect mortgage production to be similar to this quarter, a small negative. We expect firmwide unadjusted expenses for the full-year of $58 billion plus or minus and expect credit trends to continue to be very strong across the board with consumer reserve releases that will be more periodic and modest.
So to wrap up, a very, very strong result for the quarter notwithstanding headwinds reflecting the strength of each of our businesses and the benefit of our operating model.
With that, operator, we would like to open up the line for questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions). Gerard Cassidy, RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          -- that you have shared in the past if you have a parallel shift of 100 basis points, what that will do to your net interest revenue?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So you got cut off at the beginning but you are asking for our earnings at risk on 100 basis point shift?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That is great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Within the first quarter, we haven't disclosed it yet for the second quarter but it wouldn't be meaningfully different. In the first quarter, it was $2.5 billion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Do you see going forward that changing in the way you are approaching your interest sensitivity as the likelihood of rising interest rates increases in 2015 or should it remain pretty much constant?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I mean obviously earnings at risk is a representation -- it is an instantaneous parallel shift. If you look actually at our disclosures you can also see what a steepener looks like. So the way I would characterize the way to think about the impact of our asset sensitivity and interest rates rising is the way we described it both at Investor Day and at the Morgan Stanley conference which is when rates rise whenever that starts which may be in the second half of 2015 at the short end and the long end continues that over time that will deliver $8 billion to $10 billion of NII to the firm. But clearly the path to get there will be rate dependent and timing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Tying into the higher interest rates, you have been vocal about your funding side of the equation and what you expect there. Can you give us an update or more color of how you are positioned for the funding side of the balance sheet should rates rise and how much you expect to potentially maybe move off your balance sheet as it gets repriced into different types of products?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          This is Jamie. I think on the funding side, we said we have met pretty much LCR and [SFS] and we think will be the [GLAC] or least we are very close to it. That is all embedded in interest-rate exposure which Marianne gave you and that is our base case. Obviously if the world changes, we may change how we go about and do that. But I think it is a very good base case to look at. We don't have any need to change it dramatically.
I think you will all have to be prepared for the reason that rates raise -- obviously will change why people act a certain way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          My final question is there has been some talk about the regulators, the Federal Reserve maybe increasing the capital ratios for the largest banks to even higher levels than what you are mandated today to carry. Do you guys have any thoughts on whether that may actually ever get through that they may even raise the current Tier 1 common ratio numbers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think we have to wait and see. I mean remember the United States has already gone beyond most other countries and they may just be referring to that that they intend to keep that or how they modify that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The way that we think about it, obviously we don't know how things may change in the future but between (inaudible), the buffers that we and other institutions are going to run above that with LCR and SFR, our own internal liquidity framework with capital stress pump testing under CCAR under extremely severe conditions, it feels like we have a box around this and so we are planning to run the firm based upon what we know today with an eye on obviously listening to all of the things you hear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Jamie, good luck on your treatment and hope for a speedy recovery. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. Jamie, first let me say it is nice to hear you on the call and that you are sounding good and that the prognosis sounds great and I wish you all the best.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just a follow-up on the interest rate points first, second. I know you guys have been very focused on the potential for a deposit drain as things are handled somewhat differently by the Fed given the current circumstances when they eventually do raise rates.
Is there any change in that thinking of the potential for a $1 trillion-ish deposit drain and maybe $100 billion for yourselves on the basis of the Fed minutes from last week which maybe were a little contradictory in terms of the mechanics to that Peterson Institute article, which has been I think (inaudible) in everyone's thinking?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So keep in mind if the Fed, whether they use repo or just sell securities, that will reduce deposits, so factor with it, absolute formula. The question is whose deposits and what kind of deposits and when they might do something like that. I assume they will be fairly careful.
I think what we simply were saying is that some of the deposits will come out of -- nonoperating wholesale deposits already have (inaudible). Some won't. Some will come out of retail, and just people need to be prepared for. I wouldn't put it in the earth-shattering category. Just people need to be prepared and be very thoughtful about how they go about that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And given where you are on LCR, do you feel like JPMorgan is completely as positioned as it will want to be at that time, or is that still just a build that is going to take place in liquidity between now and a year from now or so?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think we are very comfortable with where we are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Remember, we are running -- LCR is an important measure. It is a regulatory measure. We are measuring it, we are reporting it, but we run the firm based upon our own internal liquidity check framework and what comes with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. The other thing that I would like to touch on is the expense guidance. Obviously, it has ticked down somewhat again, and that is probably partly because of the revenue outlook that we are looking at for this year. But is there anything implicit in that in terms of what we should expect for expenses beyond 2014 and maybe you can elaborate a little bit on how you are thinking about core expense reductions given a consistently pretty sticky revenue environment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Really what I would point you to is the discussions that we had largely at Investor Day which was to say that we continue to expect the mortgage expense story to play out over the course of the next few years which will be obviously a tailwind for us on expenses both in servicing but more particularly in production. So that is obviously a focus in 2015 and beyond.
We also are expecting to start on a journey to delivering. You saw our CBB expenses, cost of control investment are moderating and Gordon outlined at Investor Day that the CBB business 2014 through 2016 as a relative matter would deliver approximately $1 billion of expense efficiency but the profile of that we haven't been through. And then Daniel is working through, as are all of the other CEOs, the expense story in the CIB and being as diligent as you would expect him to be given the environment. But one of our positions has always been that we are running this business for the longer term and we are going to be smart about the actions we take on expenses in order to make sure that we protect the franchise but that doesn't mean that we can't and won't be more efficient across the businesses. So we haven't actually given specific guidance at the firmwide level but that is the backdrop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just want to reiterate that we always have a waste cutting like real estate, people, straight-through processing, vendors, things where we think we got a little sloppy, where we are located, but we will never, ever ever stop investing in straight-through processing, better bankers, better training, Chase net, marketing, Sapphire, EBKs -- you know the new stuff from branches. So don't confuse the two.
We will lump it in together for you. Internally, no one goes to a budget meeting and says I get my expenses down by cutting expenses and the really important things we need for the future. No one. We are not going to run the Company that way. We would rather earn less money.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, that is helpful. And then one final one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Including in that is paying our people fairly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That is obviously important. One last one for me, there have been quite a few areas where you have pulled back in order to ensure the ability to monitor and be in compliance; third-party mortgage origination was one, trade finance and in particular correspondent banking, internationally another one. Is all of the foreseeable pullback in areas of business for control reasons pretty much known now or are there other things that we should expect that you might be looking at?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I would say that it is a matter of good housekeeping that we would constantly be looking at making sure that we are simplifying our businesses where it makes sense to do it. But as a large matter, the macro matter, we are working through the things that we talk about, some of the things that you mentioned and there are no significant changes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, that is great. Thanks so much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We've got 1000 foreign correspondent banks, we sold CWT, we might very well -- we sold RPS. There are a bunch of product lines we have either closed down or eliminated and a lot of that is in the works. We put a light -- enhanced monitoring our other businesses and so we are well along the way but if something comes up that we think we should look at again, we will look at it again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Let me just follow up on it then to make sure that we don't over model revenues. Are there still meaningful incremental revenue declines that we should expect from all of those areas that have been discontinued?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The most significant revenue effect that is not yet in our run rate because the transaction is not yet closed is the exit of the physical commodities business. So obviously when that closes which may be in the early part of the fourth-quarter that would have an impact in the revenues both in the quarter and then in our run rate in 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We gave you a number at Investor Day which -- we should probably update that number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I can give you the numbers now. So at Investor Day, we said that the impact in 2014 on revenues would be a decline of $1.6 billion. Just given the timing of the physical commodities deal, the impact in 2014 is going to be closer to $1.2 billion of which about $500 million is in our run rate already.
And then when you annualize the things that will be complete by the end of the year, that 85% of everything is obviously going to get done. So once we close the year this year the impact this year will be $1.2 billion, the annualized impact that we gave was $2.8 billion and that is still our best estimate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The important thing is the four beautiful franchises, Asset Management, Commercial Bank, CIB, CCB are all doing really, really well and this doesn't affect their ability to serve their clients at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Remember also just for the purposes of completeness, it would be remiss of me not to say that expenses are also coming out as we take those revenues out and remember these are in large part businesses that were not at this time accretive to the overall firm's returns. So important to remember that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous Research - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Thanks for the completeness of the answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So we have seen a greater number of sales in the repo market. It seems to me just an issue of available collateral. But I am curious to get your take how much we are supposed to carry on it and whether or not some of the actions by Treasury in the reverse repo market can take care of that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think because the government is still buying a big portion of net treasury issuance and because they are doing -- going into the repo market and taking cash out of the system, I think that number maybe has gone from $100 billion to $200 billion over time. Remember I believe that that repo can't be rehypothecated. So I do think some of those things that cause issues in the repo market, my guess is that will sort through over time. We do believe we see dealers reducing their books in repo and you have had a lot of statements about repo and collateral and capital against it so I feel things are going to sort out over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, good. It sounds like you are not losing so much sleep over it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Not yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Marianne, you mentioned a comment when you talk about C&I loan growth, I just wanted to get a clarification. Last quarter if I remember correctly it was about flattish on a year-on-year basis and you spoke about price competition and some discipline on JPMorgan's part. This quarter you have a little bit more year-on-year growth. Still mentioned the comment about discipline but I just wanted to get a clarifying statement. Is just growth a little bit better, is the backdrop a little bit better and you expect to participate in that a little bit more?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I would say that there hasn't been a shift in sentiment but sentiment is better. It is still better year-over-year and better quarter-over-quarter. It has allowed us to deliver growth in line with the industry and we do however maintain, absolutely maintain, our credit risk discipline as it relates to the commercial space. So it is competitive. It hasn't been the case that we have historically been losing on price, it has been more on credit discipline and on simplification and derisking but --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think Marianne mentioned it but in almost every category of C&I -- I'm talking about on the Commercial Bank -- utilization was up like 1% last quarter, maybe --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Utilization in commercial was up 3% since the end of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Since the end of the year and you know, utilization is usually a pretty good measure of companies starting to expand and early on, it's receivables and inventory. You haven't really seen it in capital expenditures yet and if you looked at US capital expenditures in total including big businesses, they are kind of flat to down, that will ultimately be the driver of real growth. So if you start to see that, you are going to hopefully see a stronger economy but utilization is I think is the first sign.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I appreciate that. Last one is I just couldn't help notice the balance sheet is now at $2.5 trillion. In your discussions, I know we can't purchase our way through without jumping through a lot of hurdles, but do you feel constrained on just sheer balance sheet size? And the reason I ask is I look across most of your franchises, they are growing and they are growing nice and they are growing organically through the investments you have made. I just want to know if anybody is bringing up the issue of just absolute size?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, but can I just give you a number? I think year-over-year that balance sheet is up mostly because of money we have in the Fed. Even quarter over quarter, we've got these -- we have $350 billion or almost $400 billion at central banks around the world. We have an investment portfolio of $350 billion. We have a loan portfolio of [$700 billion]. We have already told you when they start to reverse, Q3, some of those will automatically come down.
So our balance sheet is kind of high because of all of this huge liquidity and securities in the balance sheet and eventually hopefully there will be more loans which are more productive and less just holding excess cash.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Eventually maybe a little capital return too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just to illustrate the point, if you are looking at the slides, you are looking at end of period assets that grew by $40 billion or so. If you look at the average, it was only [18] and we get a lot of volatility around cash movement at quarter end. So Jamie is right, there has been a significant amount of our growth that has been deposits and ultimately found its way on deposit with the central bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. I appreciate the answers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I would say against that, having said that of course there is a natural healthy tension now with leverage rules that we are clearly strategically optimizing the way we use our balance sheet and that will have a natural tension to keep the balance sheet growth if there is growth to be more modest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          You are also seeing -- if you are talking about G-SIFI, the big Chinese banks, the big Japanese banks and some other banks around the world growing fairly rapidly, hopefully -- eventually we will use our G-SIFI scores a little bit too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And if we are right about the liquidity drain in QE, you will see a bunch of deposits flow out potentially in the second half of next year and see some of that growth reverse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. A couple of questions. One on FIC, one on expenses and one on RWAs. Just on the FIC line, you mentioned that it was a little bit better in the last part of June and then you went on to say that the outlook is for current environment to persist. So I just wanted to ask a little bit about which environment you are talking about just the overall quarter because the quarter ends up being a little bit better than expected right in the mid part of the quarter. Are you suggesting that the end of June activities is likely to keep a positive tone to what you are expecting in the third-quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks for the question because I want to make sure I am very clear. So in June, we did see an uptick in activity in terms of client activity but volatility stayed very, very low and there was no specific catalyst for it, no catalyst that would lead us to believe that that would necessarily continue. And as we have moved into July, it so far has been our experience that it has not continued at that level. So it is more our guidance in the second half is that the 15% to 20% and the 20% plus or minus decrease that we have seen in the first half, that kind of environment is the one that we are facing over the second half.
Now we are not guiding to a number because as you very well know however many trading days into the quarter and things can change so you are going to have to pick your level and we can't predict it any better than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is just our operating assumption is that it will stay at low levels for a while. We know we are going to be wrong on that but you all have to pick whatever you think. We run the Company planning for low and hoping for better.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, and that is 15% year on year? That is 15% plus or minus down year on year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We are not giving a specific guidance. It was 20% in the first quarter, 15% in the second, that kind of environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And the third and fourth are generally lower and it could be lower than that (multiple speakers) .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Normal seasonality drivers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then on the expenses, you have outlined a couple of different areas that you are working on to get the expenses down. The question is on why in the IB you've got the repositioning cost called out specifically because I'm just kind of thinking out loud that you have got to invest to get expense saves in a broad set of areas of the business. So why call it out in the IB? Does it suggest that we will see more repo costs coming through in other areas over the next several quarters as people roll out their expense plans?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We called out the $300 million if that is what you are referring to in the CIB because it in our view anyway is a modestly sized and nonrecurring item. We are not expecting to have similar items like that. We may have some but we are certainly not our forecast that we are going to have that kind of level recurring. So really it is just to give you a sense that in the quarter we absorb that number you choose that you will to do with it in terms of your models but we don't consider that to be core.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, but in the other areas where you are also working on expense programs you don't expect that you are going to have any of those one-time repo items, repositioning items?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Not at this time, not significant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, all right. And then on the RWAs, you indicated that RWAs were up a little bit on operating risk, down on marketing credit risk and then you went on to say that was model related. Is that all your internal models, is that based on consultation with regulators? I am just wondering why the operating risk would have gone up for you given that you had your big settlement a couple of quarters ago.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So first of all, these are all the moving parts, none of them are materially significant so operational risk went up a little bit, growth went up a little bit and offset against that, we continue to always on board positions onto approved models, continue to develop our models and get approvals for our models so that we can have the most efficient RWAs that we can have. And so we saw some of that. And also portfolio runoff so we were just giving you some color that flat RWA is actually the continuation of the work that we articulated at Investor Day that will ultimately drive it down to be closer to $1.5 trillion over the next 18 months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We are a little inconsistent upfronting all of the negatives we phased in. We are not upfronting model approvals we expect to get. Model on boarding and stuff like that. There is some of that coming and obviously those need to be approved by regulators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. Okay. And then Citi settled the other day including again CDOs, you had some CDOs back in the day. Does that impact how you are thinking about the operating risk charges?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Not material. They are going to run off over time for RWA and everything else is not material. They can be restructured. I think it goes to 2017 now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          All right. Thanks a lot.

John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Following up on loan growth commentary, net interest income dollars seemed a little better than you expected at the $11 billion, are you still looking for that to be flattish kind of top of the house NII for this year or is the outlook a little better given the loan growth trends?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We said relatively flat. It came up slightly in the quarter, obviously we are pleased with that and we told you that we expected core growth for the year to be 5% plus or minus and at this point that would still be our best assessment. If loan growth does continue to improve and improves to the point where our core loan growth is above 5% then yes, we would hope to enjoy the NII benefit.
But as we look forward based upon current rates, we will be flat with a little bit of upward bias is our outlook until rates start to rise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, then in terms of share buyback --?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sorry, John, because you do continue to have albeit that everything is a little bit less than it was but you do continue to have offsets against that in terms of spread compression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. So, yes, with the 5% core loan growth you would expect NII to be relatively flat this year and flat to up a little bit next year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, if market implied curve is in fact how things play out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then on share buybacks, could you give us some thoughts about how you are thinking about using your buyback approval for this year? Did you accelerate some of the buyback activity on price weakness this quarter and do you expect to do more in the second half because the RWA reductions are starting to happen?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So first of all obviously what we can do is guided and limited by what we have approval to do. But yes, we did articulate that we were going to likely back end our share repurchases as we build towards our CET1 ratio. You can obviously see we built towards that nicely at 9.8%. And then yes, obviously particularly in the first half of the quarter, our price was favorable and we did share repurchases reflecting all of those things.
When we look at the second half without giving specifics because we don't give guidance on repurchases, we have the capacity to do $5 billion more gross over the next three quarters and we have a target to hit above 10% and we will juggle those two things together but that gives us the capacity to continue to do some repurchases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, that is helpful, thanks. On the mortgage servicing revenues, the outlook that you gave for the $600 million roughly, does that include any MSR risk management gains or do you assume none in that? Can you just clarify that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We assume none in that. Think about the MSR risk management as we generally speaking expect our results to be close to home so plus or minus zero outside of any model updates because of our hedging strategy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein - Analyst    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Last question on legal costs, this quarter they were mostly in the IB and Corporate. Any commentary on what type of issues you are currently accruing for and also could you clarify whether you have any remaining outstanding material mortgage litigation or is that mostly settled from the mortgage area?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So as much as I know and you want to hear it, we are not going to be able to talk about the specifics of what we are reserving for and we told you -- we said before that we had very little in the first quarter, we have $700 million pretax now. It is going to be this way for a while. We are going to have elevated and lumpy litigation costs as we work through the issues that you are aware of.
And then with respect to mortgage, we have settled with a large proportion of our MBS risk with the governmental counterparties but we do still have some other civil claims. But we would characterize it more behind us than in front of us and we are working through it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          First, why did trading do better than the guidance earlier in the quarter and did that relate to the 8% increase in trading VAR which was a little surprising since volatility is still so low?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On an absolute performance, so first of all two things primarily contributed to the better performance. We said 20% plus or minus. Remember that really could have been plus or minus when you go back three weeks before quarter end. So with the better activity in June, so June was a stronger month every day on average produces stronger results than the prior two months and that helped and we didn't have line of sight to that when we gave our guidance and when we affirmed our guidance.
And then the second, I called out the market partner's shares, the IPO. We sold our shares post the IPO and generated gains of over $100 million which is a couple of points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [94]

          And the VAR, I mean it is very hard to predict FICC. We are always reluctant to do it because somehow you think you actually know what is going to be the (inaudible) couple of weeks and the VAR jumps are around but some of that jumping around is really I think of underwriting positions, CMBS warehouse positions and stuff like that which come and go.

Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I always prefer more guidance than less. I have two very simple questions with complicated answers I guess. But you talked about loan growth. Is this the inflection point for loan growth? On the one hand you said there is some inventory build that is helping, on the other hand you are not seeing CapEx yet. And two quarters ago you said second half of the year loan growth should really accelerate. Do you still believe it should accelerate from this level? Is this the acceleration or are you revising back some of those expectations?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          What I would say, Mike, is that what we have seen in the second quarter gives us reasons to be optimistic that we are going to continue to see growth at around those levels in the second half of the year. Like I said, it is not that we have seen a step change but that we have seen generally better sentiment, generally better utilization rates, generally higher pipelines. The phones are ringing. It is across geographies so it just feels like the environment is conducive for us to continue to be able to add.
We have been very successful in the business banking space and yes, we have reached inflection in card. So it is our belief that we will have strong growth year-over-year in the second half but we are still in the early stages of seeing that happen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And if interest rates increase at some point, that could hurt the ability of commercial and commercial real estate borrowers to service their debt. How much cushion is there before you think that would become an issue or is that just not a factor?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is not really a factor of people who are already income producing, locked in rates and things like that. It may very well be a factor for people who want to build new things. Not on the commercial side but we did look at on the residential side there have been occasions we have rising rates and improving housing. So depending why rates are going may be the more determinant factor than just the fact that rates are going up. Rates are going up because you have a healthy economy, that may be more important than just the fact that rates are going up. We have not done the same thing in commercial, we probably should.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess the more general question is what areas and credit are you watching the most? I think, Marianne, you said auto is the best since 2006 and that has been an area mentioned by regulators. Is that the point of greatest concern or are there other areas you are watching more closely?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          For us what we are doing is being consistent on our credit discipline and so we have talked I think partly in the first half of the year about us not participating in some of the growth that others saw because we have maintained line as it relates to particularly structured credit structures and aggressive structures rather than pricing. And so we are consistently doing that. We are not changing that and our credit across products also mortgage, commercial remains broadly consistent, we are not changing that either.
So for us we are just maintaining our credit discipline. But yes, it is a very competitive place out there right now across the products and so we are seeing a little bit of that aggressiveness. We saw it in the quarters running up to this. We still see it now although it is not worse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. Can you remind us the timing of the private equity sale and how much capital is against that? It was roughly a breakeven business. I think you have about $6 billion of outstanding and what does that mean in terms of freeing up capital in a Basel III and SLR world?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I don't think we have disclosed that. It hasn't been a breakeven business over a long period of time. Obviously hasn't earned much money in the last few quarters and we are still negotiating something. It could be soon, it won't be all of OEP. It will be a part of it.
And then part of the number of you see, because I think there is $6 billion of total private equity are all heritage investment that were made by JPMorgan Chase and etc. before the Bank One merger. So they are all eventually -- that $6 billion will be zero and that frees up what, $3 billion of equity capital effectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, $3 billion. That is helpful. And then the commodities business you gave us the $2.8 billion of annual revenue (inaudible) and said it was ROE dilutive but care to give the expenses and capital against that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, just to be clear, the $2.8 billion if you go back and look at Investor Day was for all of our business simplification agenda not the physical commodities. I just called out physical commodities as being A, a big piece of it, and B, as being the biggest piece left to happen in 2014. So just to be clear on that.
And then yes, the $2.8 billion came with expenses of $2.3 billion against it. We didn't disclose the capital but when you take that into consideration it was at or below our cost of capital, not additive to returns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then lastly, this is probably an obvious question but the $100 million gain related to IPO would have been booked in the equity trading business when you were talking about the impact of the markets revenues?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Actually, it is in fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, all right. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but could you talk just a little bit about how much of the mortgage business costs are fixed and how much you would be willing to let the volume decline?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We haven't actually broken out specifically in that way but I can characterize it for you. Obviously in mortgage production, the first chunk of expenses is truly variable meaning it is paying for production on a variable basis to the salesforce and then you have a bunch of what we would called semi-fixed costs which are effectively the operators, the people, the FTEs. And then you do have true fixed costs which is the management, the real estate, the technology.
When you have a very, very small market which I think you would agree a $1.1 trillion or lower market is very small, then it is hard with the fixed cost structure to make a lot of money in the mortgage business particularly if you are taking a hard line which we are on the types of mortgage product that we want to participate in. But over time it doesn't stop the fact that this is going to be a healthy functioning mortgage market and we want to be a scale player.
So it is tricky in this kind of very, very small market but we are focusing on fixing our fixed cost base and trying to get out as much efficiency as possible.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We've been spending a lot of time in that and doing deep dives and trying to figure it out and unfortunately this one won't be the end of the year. I think of it as hopefully by the end of 2015 we give you clear sight about how we will be making normal profitability there which may take until 2016.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right and it has always been a cyclical volatile business and we had very, very strong performance over the course of 2011 and 2012 and into the first half of 2013 and we are now at that cyclical point, that cyclical low and we need a lot of things to happen. But trust me when I tell you that the fixed cost base is our number one focus or among our number one focuses and we are working very hard at it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great, thanks. Just kind of a small point, you mentioned a reserve release on the private student lending business. That was a business that you had kind of talked about potentially exiting I guess back in late last year. Is that still on the agenda?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We are not exiting, just no longer doing it and it is in runoff mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right. So we stopped originating new loans but we do have a portfolio of loans that we are managing and as they run off, we will experience all of the usual charge-offs, reserve releases but not exiting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [120]

          Got it. Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks. I have two questions. One is kind of a detailed question but I just want to make sure I understood correctly. You were talking about equity trading revenues and I think you sort of said the decline was attributable to the equity derivatives business. So can I imply that then the year-on-year cash and prime brokerage businesses were flat and all the decline came from equity derivatives? Is that what you said?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We said it was driven by derivatives. Cash out of prime brokerage did better. Prim did better than cash.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, that is clear. Just sort of a more conceptual question. I look at your core loan growth of 4% and obviously everyone has commented that is very strong and I guess about two times the industry level and kind of reconciling that with the comment you made about C&I loan growth is kind of in line with the market and you are kind of ceding some market share on residential mortgage for all of the reasons you have explained to us.
So I was just wondering if you could give some color on those areas where you are clearly taking share and just some outlook on how sustainable that is or is it just kind of a good quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So just on the mortgage thing, we are giving up share but remember that we distribute a significant amount of the mortgages that we produce and in this quarter, we actually portfolio-ed $5 billion of mortgages so we are not losing share in (multiple speakers). So we are adding to the portfolio for mortgage at just a slightly different dynamic.
We are outperforming on sales growth in cards so ultimately that will fuel outstanding growth that hopefully will be better than the industry but clearly it is modest at this point. Our C&I, we are in line if not potentially gaining a little share but we continue to outperform in real estate particularly multi-family real estate and asset management.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So all of those areas are areas you are targeting so they should feel pretty sustainable?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Understood. Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks very much. I just wanted to step back for a moment and think about what has occurred in the context of the key themes from the Investor Day last February and it sounds like there is a couple of areas where things maybe are progressing a bit more slowly and you thought mortgage it sounds like maybe one of them. But I wonder if in the context of the goals that you laid out how you feel broadly you are moving against them and whether there has been any real departures from your expectations sort of at the halfway point of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [131]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think you called it well on mortgage. Obviously the mortgage market and housing conditions outside of home prices are challenging and that looks like it is set to be a slower journey. But if you step back and look across all of our other businesses, when I talked about the underlying core performance drivers growing strongly, that reflects our strategy. So we continue to build and grow our businesses demonstrated by those performance drivers as well as simplify and address the control agenda and we are making the appropriate progress on both of those. And it is showing in our results.
I mean a quarter where obviously there are some challenges to print over a 14% return on tangible common equity is evidence of the strategy working. If you go through each of the comments I made in asset management, we are investing in the sales force, we are seeing that deliver growth, we have record inflows, we are seeing international deliver loan growth. It is very consistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [132]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          You haven't seen us give you a roadmap on how we are going to get from 7% return on tangible common equity to 14%. We are already at 14%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [133]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right, so I guess the real heart of my question is we look at these financial results which are clearly better than expectation against a backdrop which maybe is certainly not better, maybe worse than what we thought at the beginning of the year. And I wonder if that then suggests that in fact things are accelerating ahead of the timeline or in greater magnitude than the discussion in February?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [134]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, look, I can't over emphasize this. We do not run the Company for quarterly profits. We make long-term decisions in people, systems, technology, products, services, stuff like that and a lot of things drive short-term profits but the profit you have in any one quarter relates to the decisions you made the last five years. And so we feel great about these companies. The big weak spot which we all acknowledge is mortgage and we are going to put -- we have got great people there. We are going to put elbow to the metal there, we are going to invest some more money in their systems.
We've got some catch-up to do. We got caught in the middle of as you know WaMu, Bear Stearns, origination platforms. But if you look at each of these businesses, they are all doing fine and we are looking at how we can grow them over the next five or 10 years and that is what we are going to do.
I honestly mean it. I don't care whether FIC is up 10% or 15% or down 10% or 15% next quarter. I actually think that is a complete waste of time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe just lastly, one of the themes for this year has been maybe the narrowing a little bit of the client base based on risk or profitability profile. I am just wondering how that is progressing particularly with respect to the commercial bank?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think most of that has been done. So you have seen not all of it but the full effect of that in terms of which segments we are getting out of, which ones we are going to focus on, which ones we put enhanced monitoring in so the same thing in the CIB with our correspondent banking. There may be more. We are always going to do good housekeeping and there are some clients we have had conversations with that are still on the books but they will be leaving down the road. But none of those things will be material to the future of this Company.
They may affect revenues a little bit in the fourth quarter or first quarter next year but that is not why we are doing it. We are doing this to protect ourselves, run the business properly, meet our regulatory and control objectives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [137]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And so -- and this is the last thing for me. But does that suggests that maybe we are getting closer to the point where the reported numbers in terms of the balance sheet -- the loan expansion and the core numbers will get closer to converging?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [138]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Think about this, the core number, the reported number being primarily driven by the legacy mortgage and credit card portfolios so the high end activity that we have been talking about is immaterial in the context of that runoff portfolio. That is what is driving the difference. So we will continue to see that portfolio run off and as it runs off and gets smaller, it will have less of an impact but it has been a fairly consistent story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [139]

Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [141]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, good morning. So on the consumer business, I wanted to ask a question about the payment side and we have seen really good volume growth metrics and that turn in the origination volumes. Can you talk of just about what you are seeing in the underlying customer as opposed to what you guys are benefiting from activation and new card growth, just your general sense of the customer and spending?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [142]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We have a large market share so while we may be outperforming the market what we see is generally a fairly good picture of what is happening. And what I can tell you is if you decompose our growth, you have still strong high single-digit growth in nondiscretionary spend categories driven principally in grocery and oil space which is not all that unsurprising but I think is actually instructive about consumer spending and inflation.
And then if you look at the discretionary growth which is growing even more strongly in the double-digit territory, it is across the board. It is travel, it is restaurants, it is retail, it is across the board so consumers are spending very strongly in both categories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (multiple speakers) Merchant processing we are growing at like 12% a year and we are investing more money, do a better job for merchants there and we have 35 million people bank online. I think 15 million who use mobile bank, it was 12 million or 15 million that use mobile banking. So you are going to see us extend products and services all of which hopefully will be merchant friendly and consumer friendly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And on that merchant piece, just can you just explain the disconnect between the volume side continuing to look better and then the transaction growth rate slowing a little bit recently? Is it a larger ticket size or are there some different underlying thing in the metrics?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Mostly merchants aggregating their transactions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [146]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [147]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So it is how it flows through to you guys?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, great. And then my little question. Tax rate was a little low this quarter so your outlook generally speaking on the tax rate going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [150]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, so our general longer-term outlook is our tax rate is 30% plus or minus just given obviously the pre-tax (inaudible) of the 2014 market, it will be slightly lower than that more in line with this quarter.
(multiple speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [151]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I don't remember if you mentioned it, but in other, there is private equity which was close to zero and bounces around. Treasury and CIO, which was close to zero and kind of will stay there and there is other corporate where a normal rate would be around 200, this quarter was around 400 because of some of the tax benefits. Think of that as going back to 200 give or take next quarter for your models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [154]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you very much. I know a lot of questions have been asked. But I want to go back to the mortgages a little bit, the 16 billion. The market was up depending on who you listen to probably in the $260 billion to $300 billion range but you guys stayed relatively flat and it looks like really you guys gave up market share with MBS issuance stuff that you sell to Fannie and Freddie and maybe you picked up more market share in the jumbo market.
Of the $5 billion that you portfolio-ed that you talked about, was that all jumbos and you could talk a little bit about maybe stepping away from Fannie and Freddie?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [155]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So of the $5 billion, $3.6 billion was jumbo, about $400 million was (inaudible) and then about $1 billion was conventional so that is how it breaks down. So mostly jumbo, yes, and we are holding share in jumbo.
And with respect to the market share loss, it was principally two things. It was principally a strategy that we've talked about to do less in the high -- high LTV, low FICO space. We priced to the risk-adjusted return that we see in that business given the cost of service the loans that default and that is what the impact has been on our market share.
And then also the HARP burn out, we were very successful in HARPing our loans over the course of the last couple of years. Our borrowers who our technically eligible are no longer responding so we are seeing that burn out. The bit that is really truly the conventional loss which there was some, is really on price competition and we absolutely intend to compete on price.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [156]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          When you say high FICO -- that is FHA? So our FHA volumes are way down and we've studied FHA based upon the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that, we have lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA. We are trying to figure out what we should do about it going forward.
Just to give you three numbers, we collected $600 million in insurance. They disputed $200 million. The government called that a fraud. We reimbursed $600 million to get out of the lawsuit because it was a threatening lawsuit even though in my opinion it was a commercial dispute between FHA and ourselves about that. And the whole time FHA collected another $1.8 billion in premium. So the real question to me is should we be in the FHA business at all and we are still struggling with that.
We want to help the consumers there but we can't do it at great risk to JPMorgan so until they come up with some kind of safe harbors or something, we are going to be very, very cautious in that line of business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [157]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And Jamie, on a follow-up question on your utilization comments which I thought was very good, but a lot of bankers have talked about as long as deposit is growing, it is hard for that utilization rate to go up and we did see strong deposit growth and we are still seeing utilization rates. Should that deposit growth start to go down if we are seeing an uptick in utilization rates?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think it has slowed down a little.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [159]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It went down slightly I think.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [160]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Remember, you are talking about different borrowers (inaudible) so it might be something that was two million deposits and some start to borrow money but in general, you are right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [161]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So if you look at commercial just as an illustration of your point, what we have got going on is utilization rates in the last few quarters have picked up by 3 points. They are at 33% still much, much lower than you would expect them to be over time which would be slightly above 40%. But you do see deposits flattening out. In fact, there is a little bit of decline.
It is not absolutely the case at this point that we can say people are starting to spend their deposits and utilize their lines. As Jamie said, CapEx is still not really out there but that is what you would expect and in this business we did not see strong growth in deposits.

          Good morning. So, Marianne, I actually had a question about the presentation that you had given last month at the Morgan Stanley conference. You alluded to a targeted loan to deposit ratio of roughly 70% through the cycle. And I suppose what I was wondering when crunching some of the numbers given the tougher treatment for loans versus high-quality securities under the LCR, whether there is a peak level of loan to deposit ratio or growth that we should think about given the constraints which exist under the new liquidity regime?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [165]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          First of all, just to make a conceptual point which is we didn't have a target for loan deposits. We were just trying to make the point that obviously as we think forward to the impact of interest rates on our performance over time, we would expect both a mix shift in deposits back towards interest earning and CDs but also expect to see the economy growing and loans growing and that needed to be taken into consideration. So it wasn't really a target, it was just a simulation to start with that.
But it was based loosely on levels that we have seen at least in part the cycle that we were referring to. And then you are right, there is a dynamic where because of LTR, we will always have a -- because of our liquidity requirements internally as well, we will have liquid assets that will be structurally higher than they would had previously been and therefore from a mix perspective, that would have an impact. But at this point given where loan to deposits are, I think that would be a high class problem to be talking about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Remember there are some unused lines so there is not a loan on the balance sheet that still 100% LCR. So what's really going to happen is it is going to be done at the client level -- capital, LCR, commitments, etc, that is where you are really going to have to manage it, the capital level, the desk level, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve Chubak,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank. Actually that is a great transition for my next question which relates to pricing in some of the multiple binding constraints on capital that exist today. And some of the discussions that we have had with your competitors have suggested that some believe it is still a little bit too early to fully bake in the cost of managing to all the different capital rule sets that exist today whether it is risk-based, leverage-based or even CCAR. And it appears that you have been managing more actively to all the different constraints out there.
And in light of that, I was wondering whether you have seen any impact for more aggressive pricing by peers in terms of your relative market share in certain product areas particularly within the CIB?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          What we have seen a little bit of is trade finance cost have gone up, a little bit in municipal businesses and there you have seen a little bit more restructuring on the type of business people do. Remember some of the repricing may not take place in the product, it may take place in the relationship because all products have loss leaders, etc. But we haven't seen a huge amount of repricing taking place yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [169]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think if you think about --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [170]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have heard some complaints by the way that some of the revolvers are smaller and shorter. It is not the price as much as it is the sizing. And then you have heard some commentary in the market that inventories -- bonds are lower and spreads will gap out so you are starting to see some of it but eventually -- I have never seen a business where the cost of goods sold doesn't eventually get priced in the business. It doesn't have to be priced into the eggs and the milk, it just has to be priced in the transaction, the whole bag the person walks out of the supermarket with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [171]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think one way to look at it is to say while we are absolutely managing through this complex environment, Basel III Tier 1 common still is our binding constraint at the margin, that is how we allocate capital to the businesses and that is the sort of primary lend that we are using to price. And what you are going to see, as Jamie talked about, is that the leverage and LCR and other constraints including stressed capital are going to play out at the client level as we just are becoming more efficient at how we deploy our balance sheet rather than necessarily a repricing strategy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [172]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And CCar, we are pushing CCAR down. To the extent we can, we are going to push CCAR down to those things which create CCAR-ness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve Chubak,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [173]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks and I suppose could you give potentially any context as to what event may prompt that repricing? Even if the leverage rules are finalized and efficiently implemented this year, do you expect that that is when you will begin to see a lot of your peers began to reprice some of these effects into their inventory or into their trading securities or are they likely going to delay at least the repricing until the rules are fully implemented which is going to be a 2018 event?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [174]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wouldn't hold your breath. Some people are leaving businesses, some are optimizing decline levels, some are having strategic changes and it will happen over time and we are quite patient about it. We are in no rush. We're not going to try to lead it or anything like that. It will happen over time.
Like I said, you have seen it in trade finance, you've seen it in certain municipal businesses, you have seen it in -- and all the rules aren't final. When the rules become final, people may react differently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve Chubak,  Nomura Asset Management - Analyst    [175]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          All right, great. That is extremely helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.

Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [177]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the SLR. It seems like the improvement you had sequentially was I think mostly driven by capital and the preferred issuance. Can you give us where we are in terms of compression trade and the impact, is it still a lot more to come or is that mostly in there? Then I guess any thoughts or updates on what that impact can be and if you expect that to be adopted by the Fed?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [178]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, the improvement at the bank and the holding company was retained earnings, [pressed] net of capital distributions but we continue to work through all of the other initiatives we have to optimize leverage including compression trades and pair ups and the like. That is actually happening a little bit more slowly than we had thought just broadly in the industry. It still presents an opportunity, it is not the most sizable opportunity but we are diligently getting after it.
And then with respect to (inaudible), we estimated clearly it is a complex calculation so we will be slightly wrong in our estimate. We estimated it to have a benefit for the firm of 30 basis points and for the bank at 40 basis points. Yes, we would expect that at some point it would be ultimately adopted by the US regulators but that doesn't look like it expects to be helping our numbers this year or next.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [179]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, got you. And then maybe just -- I don't if it is related or not but I looked at your derivatives receivable on the balance sheet, it has been declining pretty steadily down 20% year-over-year. Is that reflective of just demand given low volatility and low activity levels or is there something structural there? Are you guys actively managing your receivables down or just trying to get a sense of the cyclical versus structural argument?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [180]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is essentially cyclical. I mean I wish we could actively manage it down because it is positive (inaudible) calculation but the truth of the matter is it is a factor of activity levels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [181]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, it is primarily activity levels. Okay. One last one on the CDO question I think earlier, I think we saw Citigroup settle with the DoJ regarding -- and they included CDOs. I don't think your settlement included that. Is that something that you think remains out there or just something unique to them? I know you did settle one complaint with the SEC a few years ago. Just wanted to get a sense of how you think about any remaining litigation risk around CDOs. Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [182]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We don't think it is significant.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Thank you.

          Just a follow-up, Jamie, on the FHA commentary that you had. I am just wondering about the implications for how you hit the CRA requirements. Is there any interplay there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [186]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So CRA, remember is a combination of lower and middle income mortgages so we will obviously try to meet those commitments. It includes how many branches you have in lower and middle income so we will continue to build that. It is a function of CDFI, like lending to small business or community development funds which we will continue to do. So it runs a whole gamut and we will meet our CRA commitment.
Yes if you don't do in the FHA, it hurts you a little bit but to do FHA. lose billions of dollars that is a whole different level of shareholder responsibility and so we've got to be very careful how we handle that. I am hoping FHA comes forth and comes up with some real bright lines and harbors to make it easy for us to try to do what the government wants us to do but we can't get penalized severely for some of the things that happen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [187]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So doing it in the FHA, you have got the Ginnies to their 4-year RWAs are lower, getting the same credit for CRA and loans is obviously a little bit more capital consumptive so that is part of the challenge?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [188]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is all of that. We are going to meet CRA. We report CRA to our sellers every month and like I said, it cuts across a wide variety of things that we do for people and we just did this great thing in Detroit that is a lot of CRA credits. We can you mortgages ourselves that we can put on balance sheet that we think are less risky than FHA insurance. So we will figure it out.
We are just thoroughly, thoroughly confused about how we got treated, how we've got it going forward and we are kind of waiting for -- we have spoken to government for some kind of guidance going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [189]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So this is on the reps and warranties on the FHA?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [190]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - CFO    [191]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It's deals and reps and warrants.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Chairman and CEO    [192]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It is the reps and warrants that there should be a commercial resolution of the dispute but you don't have [treble] damages if something goes wrong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [193]
