Presentation

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second-quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is being recorded.
(Operator Instructions)
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, and good morning everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55, and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop. While there are no significant items shown here on the page, our underlying performance was even stronger if you exclude the impact of other notable items primarily credit, legal and tax, all of which you'll hear about as I go through the presentation. That strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IBCs compared to the first quarter, as well as strong core loan growth of 16% reflecting good demand across both consumer and wholesale and record consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion.
Before I go through the results, let me spend a moment on two topics that are top of mind. First, an update on wholesale credit. You will see that the total wholesale credit costs this quarter were approximately $200 million. Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by oil and gas and metals and mining. And those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases, so they were previously reserved, which means that underlying the net $50 million reserve build we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million, principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB.
Although the oil and gas sector remains stressed and reserves will continue to be idiosyncratic, overall trends have been somewhat positive with oil prices continuing to stabilize and firming sentiment in the sector improving access to capital markets. In addition outside of energy, we still have not seen contagion or deterioration in our wholesale or consumer portfolios.
Second, on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk-[off] environment. And following the decision the markets were quite volatile, as expected, and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath. The market functioned quite well, absorbing the volatility. And despite the significant increases in volumes, our systems were stable and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance.
With respect to next steps, as you know the ultimate relationship between the UK and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and passporting specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked. We continue to work on plans for the full range of outcomes, but we will be appropriately patient. The most important point is that we remain committed to fully supporting our European and UK clients across businesses, and we will be fully able to do this. And while executing against certain of these options would be complex, ultimately we will protect the franchise and minimize any friction costs so that they will be manageable for the Company.
Moving on to page 2. Revenue of $25.2 billion was up $700 million year on year on higher net interest income. For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day, despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given that our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve, and as industry deposit read prices to date have remained low, coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth. Non-interest revenue was flat year on year, with the increase in markets revenue being offset by declines in IBCs as well as Asset Management.
Adjusted expense of $14.1 billion was down $140 million, reflecting continued progress against our commitments. We still expect full-year expense of $56 billion, plus or minus, as the second half of the year includes our expectation of an increase in the [FDI] surcharge in the third and fourth quarters.
Moving onto capital on page 3. The Firm's advanced fully phased in CET1 ratio was 11.9%, with standardized at 12.1%, both up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation, with RWA remaining relatively flat. Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6%, as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth.
This quarter we returned $4.4 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $2.6 billion of net repurchases and common dividends of $0.48 a share. Finally, we're pleased we did not receive an objection to our capital plan. And the Board authorized gross repurchases of up to $10.6 billion.
Moving onto page 4 and Consumer & Community Banking. Consumer & Community Banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers. We had record deposit growth again this quarter, up 10% year on year. Average loans were up 11%, with core loans up 23% driven by mortgage and auto, but with continued strength across all products. And we had record business banking loan originations of $2.2 billion, up 14% year on year, and with a strong pipeline, up 17%.
We added nearly 2 million households year on year, with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter, reflecting strong acquisition trends including the launch of Freedom Unlimited. And finally, our active mobile customer base remains the largest among US banks, up 18%.
Revenue of $11.5 billion included some non-core items which contributed a little under $200 million. Principally a one-time gain on Visa Europe and negative mark-to-market on Square. Adjusted for this, revenue was up 2%.
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth. Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low supporting production margins and on growth in NII as we added $14 billion of high quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue.
Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was up, but flat if you exclude the non-core items I mentioned, with gross in card and auto offsetting the impact of card renegotiations. Expense was down 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitments, allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day.
Finally, credit trends across the consumer businesses continue to be favorable, with charge-offs in card trending up slightly. Over the last two, three years we have responsibly expanded our credit box in card in the prime and near-prime space. As these vintages season, we would naturally expect a higher loss rate and performances in line with our expectations. These loans are coming on at ROEs higher than the portfolio average. So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly, and as such we built $250 million of reserves this quarter.
Moving to auto credit. Competitive pressures have caused some lenders to take more layered risk. We have maintained our underwriting discipline with average FICO scores and LTVs better than the industry, and with a very sharp focus on avoiding risk layering. Our credit performance is in line with expectations, and we built $50 million in reserves this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth. Against these reserve builds we saw releases of $125 million, principally driven by mortgage.
Turning to page 5 and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.2 billion, and an ROE of 15%. In banking IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees. We maintained share and ranked Number One in global IBCs, ranking Number One in North America and EMEA. Advisory fees were flat versus a wallet that declined 15%. This quarter we ranked Number Two globally and grew share by 50 basis points.
In equity underwriting, global issuance improved after a weak first quarter but was down from a strong quarter last year, with fees down 37% in a market down 42%. We continued to rank Number One globally, growing share by 30 basis points, and we ranked Number One in every product category for the first half of this year. [Debt] underwriting fees were down 2% from a strong prior year, largely in line with a market which was down 4%. And we ranked Number Two globally.
Moving onto the outlook for fees. Given the decline in M&A volumes, lower wallet is expected in the second half of 2016. We expect to see positive momentum in ECM, as the new issuance market continues to improve. And we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high grade bond issuance offset by lower acquisition finance.
Lending revenue of $277 million was down 8%, reflecting mark-to-market losses on hedges of accrual loans. Markets revenue of $5.6 billion was up 23% year on year. As I mentioned at the beginning, the Brexit vote triggered a spike in volatility and volumes across asset classes. We were able to meet our clients' needs, execute their transactions and provide liquidity.
Fixed income revenue of $4 billion was up 35% versus a weak second quarter last year. The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with strong performance in rates and currencies in emerging markets on higher client flows. And performance also improved in credit and securitized products, as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment driving increased primary and secondary market activity.
Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year. With respect to the third quarter, client activity is returning to more normal levels and trading performance so far has been fine. Credit costs of $235 million were driven by a reserve build for oil and gas. And finally expense of $5.1 billion was down 1% year on year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 30%.
Moving onto page 6 and Commercial Banking. Overall a solid quarter for Commercial Banking with net income of nearly $700 million on revenue of $1.8 billion, and an ROE of 16%. IB revenue rebounded from the first quarter. It was up 23% sequentially and flat year on year. And we continued to see strong momentum in loan growth, with average loan balances up 13% year on year. Commercial real estate loans grew 18%, reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking. And C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both corporate client banking and middle market.
Revenue was up 4% year on year driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth. And expense of $731 million was up 4%, reflecting continued investments in bankers and technology. Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by oil and gas but almost fully reserved. And outside of energy credit performance continues to be strong.
Moving onto page 7 and Asset Management. Asset Management reported net income of $521 million with a 29% pretax margin and an ROE of 22%. Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year on year as we continue to feel the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity. Expense of $2.1 billion was down 13% year on year, largely driven by lower legal expense, and recall that the prior year included a non-core loss. AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $2.3 trillion were both up 1% sequentially and down 5% and 3% year on year, respectively.
We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows into our fixed income products, with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset. Our long-term investment performance remained good, with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years. Lastly, we had record loan balances of $112 billion, up 4% year on year, driven by mortgage, up 20%.
Turning to page 8 and corporate. Corporate reported a net loss of $166 million, which included two notable items. There was a net legal benefit reflecting some favorable developments in the quarter offset by a number of tax items, including additions to tax reserves for developments relating to open audit periods. As a result of the tax items our managed tax rate for the quarter was 39%. Adjusted it would have been closer to 36%.
Now turning to page 9 and moving onto the outlook. To reiterate, our Firm-wide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent.
To wrap up. A strong quarter reflecting our leadership positions and the benefits of our diversified franchise, with the consumer businesses firing on all cylinders and with robust loan growth across all businesses. We had a good result in markets, continuing to demonstrate our ability to support clients no matter the environment. And just before I open up to Q&A, just for those of you on the phone, Jamie is here. He has a very hoarse voice, so we'll try and use it sparingly. If you hear him croaky, that's why. Operator, open up the line, please.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Technical difficulty) comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Foran,  Autonomous - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Foran,  Autonomous - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know it's very early, and it's probably limited in what you can say because you mentioned it depends on the timeline of Brexit and how passporting works, but is there any qualitative thoughts you can give us around the operational and/or legal issues we should be watching as this develops -- legal entity restructuring, net impacts of moving people versus lower-cost geographies and things like that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian, I know that everybody is keenly interested to hear what we have to say, but the truth of the matter is it's very, very early days. The new government is just forming as we speak. Negotiations need to be given some time to unfold and take shape. So it's really too early to hypothesize.
We would hope that we can continue to operate the way we are right now. But we will just continue to evaluate the landscape, as I'm sure you will, over the coming weeks, months and quarters, and plan accordingly. The most important thing is that we intend to continue to support our European franchise and clients throughout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Foran,  Autonomous - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I appreciate that. Maybe switching gears, you mentioned the Consumer business was firing on all cylinders. Clearly, there's some nervousness in the market that the credit cycle is turning.
I wonder if you could touch on two things, which are -- maybe a little bit more detail on the seasoning impact you saw -- you mentioned in Card. Is it just seasoning or is there any like-for-like deterioration? And then in auto, you mentioned risk layering. What particular factors are you seeing layered in the underwriting box that make you concerned right now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, on the card space, as you know, we have loans running off. We're replacing them all of the time. Over the course of the last couple years, since the end of 2013, we made some changes to our credit box and our credit risk policies very, very thoughtfully. And we've been monitoring them very closely.
And what we're seeing in terms of the loss rates and the seasoning of them is fully in line with our expectations. And these loans are coming on at higher risk-adjusted margins. So, the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. So, nothing that would speak to anything other than our full expectations for our credit risk appetite.
And with respect to Auto, not to speak for others, but obviously when you look at lower FICO scores and high LTVs and longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you've already seen used car prices soften some and they're likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch. And so we've been very, very thoughtful about that, not just today but as we've been going through the cycle. And not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry, but we've been very, very careful in -- and low percentage of subprime origination -- very, very careful about looking at those layered risks.
So nothing in our -- and remember, for Auto this year, I think the charge-off rate's going to be 40-ish basis points compared to a long-run average of more like 60. We're sort of reverting to a more normal level, if nothing else. And used car prices will ultimately come down, and we're being thoughtful about that.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, Jim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe just talk a little bit about the net interest margin and the outlook there. It was down 5 basis points. It looked like it was mostly in the funding costs. I just wanted to get a sense of what was driving -- I think long-term debt was an up-trading. Liability costs were up. Can you give us a sense of what's going on there and how to think about that going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the risk of not getting like overly complicated, the long-term debt expense -- our NII was flat with loan growth. And NII on loan growth being offset by long-term debt expense, which was largely to do with the hedging of non-dollar debt and just relative quarter-over-quarter small moves in currency levels and currency basis. So, I would honestly characterize it, not to sort of underplay it, as quarter-over-quarter noise.
Looking forward -- so when you look at our NIM, you have NII flat. You have the balance sheet growing, as we expected, both on loans and trading assets. So, NIM just naturally is down a few basis points. But we would be looking for NII to be up slightly in the third and fourth quarter, and for our NIM to be relatively stable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research Group - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's helpful.
And maybe just one follow-up on the prior question of credit -- how should we think about the provisioning going forward in Consumer? Is that going to be a consistent build or is that a catch-up that we saw this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, I would say there's going to be two things. First of all, obviously when you talk about Consumer, it kind of gets dwarfed by Card. So let's start with Card.
We are growing the portfolio. We added 4% core loans year over year in Card. So naturally, as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserves. So there will be some of that, but I would characterize it as modest.
And then, as these vintages continue to season, we've been experiencing very, very low loss rates at circa 2.5%. They will trend up slightly. So there will be a little bit of rates impact, too, but again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs.
I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors, but for all the right reasons. And similarly, volume-wise in Auto we should see some adds, but again, in comparison to Card, modest.

Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Good morning. So my first question is -- given how well JPMorgan did on the CCAR relative to last year's results, and it seems like RWA and SLR exposure have stabilized over the past few quarters, how comfortable are you perhaps allocating more balance sheet to the investment bank, given that you seem to be very well positioned to continue to gain market share, especially in markets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, as you know, Erika, everything that we do, we do with a view to, first of all, the client franchise and making sure that we're supporting our clients. And then secondarily, with a view to all of our binding constraints. We will provide capital and access to the CIB. But also take into consideration our overall objective of making sure that we stay in the 3.5% G-SIB bucket. So we will continue to try and find capacity to be able to recycle it and grow high-ROE/high-ROA business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And was there anything to call out on the equities, the $1.6 billion equities number, that could be a little bit more one-time in nature for the quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not anything significant, no. I think you've got to compare it to the prior year, which was stronger, particularly this time last year in Asia. And that's less true today -- stronger in Europe, less strong in Asia. It's more of a regional story than any particularly significant items.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, Betsy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, two questions -- one on the outlook page. I see on the printed page it's the same as what you had last quarter for the Company overall, obviously. But I heard the emphasis on NII was on the plus side, right, $2 billion year on year plus. Is that the right nuance that you were trying to communicate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So let me -- two pieces to the story. Yes, the guidance is $2 billion-plus year on year. You'll recall when we came in to Investor Day, we said we would expect $2 billion, rates flat. It looks like rates will be flat, at least in the front end at this point, at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year.
You've seen already in the first two quarters that year over year we're up $1.4 billion. We were doing better than that on a combination of lower deposit bases reprices and also on strong loan growth.
But if you annualize that, that would be too high. We are going to have some impact in NII of the lower 10-year. It's not significant. But it will offset that to a degree. We would expect our NII to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion up year on year -- largely strong loan growth, low reprice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then on the loan growth side, you've been funding this in part from just a mix shift, right, where your loan-to-deposit ratios moved up very nicely. It's still very low at 66%, but up 2 percentage points Q on Q, and up from 61% year on year. I'm just wondering how far do you think you can take that before you might want to look to fund loan growth with deposit growth more ratably?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would say we've been doing a combination. We've been growing our deposits more strongly than the industry. So we continue to be net-net attracting more deposits than the industry, and also, as you say, a mix shift out of securities and into loans.
Our outlook for loan growth through the remainder of the year is to be at the higher end of our range. We said 10% to 15% core loan growth, and at this point, demand still seems robust. So we would expect to be at the higher end of that range. We certainly have been this quarter.
So at this point I would say that it's a combination of factors. And remember that the way we think about our investment securities portfolio also takes into consideration how we think about positioning the Firm's duration of equities. So all of those factors will contribute.

Operator    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, Glenn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning. One more rate question -- as you mentioned, you're super sensitive on the front end of the curve, and you just alluded to the curve is flatter. I'm curious about that great chart that you roll out on Investor Day that talks about -- we make $3 billion more through 2018 if rates stay flat, and $6 billion more if the curve goes down the implied path. The implied path is now lower. Just curious how much those numbers change if the current curve holds?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I get this wrong, I apologize. But I think it was actually we make $3.5 billion on the rates implied and $6 billion on normalized rates. But in any case, let me just talk about rates flat versus implied right now. And just because things can change so quickly, let's just focus on 2017.
Rates flat from here. So, with the 10-year at about 1.5% and IOER at 50 basis points, because of the loan growth, notwithstanding any sort of long-end pressure, we would still expect year over year our NII next year to be up between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, implied, which is actually not that much different from that. So it does have about 20 basis points better long-end rates by the end of 2017, but otherwise relatively flat through the end of 2017 would be about $0.5 billion more than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is perfect, thank you.
Other question was -- there's some regulators chirping a little bit about concerns in commercial real estate. Some of the other banks have mentioned that you're growing like a weed, and your credit is great. So can we just talk a little bit about what you think you're doing differently to both get that growth and then what you're doing to avoid mistakes of the past? And that'll be good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Growing like a sunflower, not like a weed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look, I'll say a couple of things. The first is, a lot of that growth is commercial term lending. And it is the case that we have the technology and a process that has speed and certainty of execution, and competitive funding costs. So it is the case that it's a value proposition that we're able to bring to clients, I think, that differentiates us. We're able to close in times that are a fraction of what the industry is.
Secondarily, we're really concentrated on identified, supply-constrained markets, low-rent stabilized. So these are not the same properties that had problems in the past. We have -- since the previous cycle, we have looked carefully at our underwriting, and there are some things and some regions and some products that we either don't do or do significantly less of. So we're very, very careful. But we're looking at some really good credit quality in our commercial real estate portfolio right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Matt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Marianne. Thanks for taking my question.
Wanted to ask a couple -- wanted to ask a question on the cost side of things where the overhead ratios, both in the CIB and the Consumer Bank, dropped fairly materially quarter over quarter. I guess I'm just looking for some guidance here in terms of how much of the expense initiatives that you've already been talking about, both in the CIB and the CCB, how much progress did you make in this quarter on that, and was that an outsized contributor to the improvement in the overhead ratios?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [38]

So I would say in the CIB, it's also a revenue story. So you need to consider both factors (multiple speakers).
So let me talk about where we are on the expense commitments. And you'll recall that -- whether you remember a $4.8 billion number or a $5.5 billion number in total, we're about 70% of the way through delivering against that across the CIB and the CCB at the end of the second quarter, and we continue to make progress.
In the CCB, obviously, it is generally more progressive. And in the CIB, it's a bit more about technology and operations, and it takes some time to deliver that.
But fundamentally we continue to chug through that. And we will get there over the course of the next several quarters. So I would say in line with our expectations, and is a contributing factor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then just in the CIB specifically, you mentioned the comp ratio there was 30%. That's sort of at the low end of your -- of the range that you typically talk about, which is 30% to 35%.
I'm presuming that's largely driven by the better-than-expected revenues. Was there anything else going on there, or was that just pretty much a result of a benign revenue -- a relatively benign revenue environment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I would say the comp-to-revenue ratio is an outcome, just for what it's worth. Obviously we try to give the range to give people an idea. We pay competitively and we pay for risk-adjusted performance.
But there's nothing notable going on. We've been actually at the lower end of our range for a little while now.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, Mike.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. How is CIB doing in Europe and against European bank competitors in terms of revenue growth, share, the degree of competition? Some competitors are pulling back and you guys have stayed the course. Are you seeing the benefit from that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So it's always a little tricky. The share thing is going to become clearer with a rear-view mirror than it is necessarily at a moment in time. It does feel like we are doing fairly well competitively, not just against European banks, but just generally. And not just in Europe, but generally, because we, as you say, have continued to be there for clients across products, across the globe.
So I would say that we feel like we are doing fairly well. We'll know whether that is share gains when we are able to actually look at that in the rear-view mirror.
But there's still plenty of competition out there. So we're just focused on serving our clients the right way. But it does feel a little bit like we're doing well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I know you were asked already about Brexit. Maybe if we could hear from you, Jamie, about the implications of Brexit. Marianne, you said, quote, minimize friction costs. If you can just give us some sense of what that means?
You've given us a lot of guidance about the recent quarter and the year ahead. But you have what could be a monumental event, and you haven't really talked to investors about that since Brexit's occurred. How do you think about the currency risk, the cost, the revenues? And are you delaying any investments, given the increased uncertainty?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase - Chairman & CEO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to try to tell you as best I can, if you can hear me. So, number one, we do think it will reduce the GDP, the UK and the EU, a little bit. And obviously that's not going to affect our business plans. That will affect the economies a little bit.
Number two, we know it's going to create uncertainty for an extended time period. So we don't think we can answer or make certain all these things you want to know because there are a lot of parties involved. We are hoping that the political leaders are very sensible. It makes sense for both the EU and for Britain to think through the process to make it sensible, whatever changes they make, to give businesses time. I'm talking about years -- time to adjust to the new reality, which we don't know what it is.
I think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients day in and day out. If it adds extra cost, so be it. I'm not really worried about it. It would be nice if it doesn't create huge turmoil.
I'm hoping the EU is sensible, but we're going to be prepared. As Marianne mentioned, there's a range of outcomes. Any one (inaudible) we'll try to be prepared for each one of them.
We're not going to, like, pull back on serving people in Italy, Germany, France, UK or Spain because it might lead to higher costs. I would accept the higher cost, as opposed to disrupt our clients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would also point out, Mike, that competitively we are not in this situation alone. And so we're going to take our time to work out what the right course of action is. And obviously we'll update you as and when that becomes clearer.
We're not going to be at a competitive disadvantage. If anything, as we talked about earlier, we feel like we're in a position of strength.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just, first off, had a follow-up. So on Brexit, post this development, have you seen any impact on your banking pipelines? Has this had any impact on appetite for M&A, particularly if there is a component that involves either the continent or the UK?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The truth of the matter is, it's a bit early to say for that, too. I hate to continue to repeat that.
I will tell you that, generally speaking, uncertainty is not particularly conducive or constructive for M&A. But in this case, I think there are some offsets. So I would start with, in terms of the actual strategic dialogue with CEOs and at the boardrooms, it is as good as it's ever been.
If you think about the other factors that would be supportive of M&A, like cheap financing globally, low organic growth, good multiples, solid economy in the US and globally notwithstanding a bit of the steam taken out in Europe or the UK, all of that should continue to be supportive for strategic M&A. At the end of the day -- and currency could be supportive of cross-border activities. So there are puts and takes.
I'm certain that there will be some people who think carefully through the right timing and what to do. At the end of the day, the strategic proposition should ultimately win out in most cases. And similarly, volatility, generally speaking, is not particularly conducive in terms of ECM, but investor appetite is still there, and there have been deals priced post-Brexit.
It's a little early. There's still activity. Volatility is reasonably subdued at this point. And I think, because there are no event calendars out there right now, there's still quite a lot of opportunity in the space. Obviously, DCM, low rates would be a tailwind, notwithstanding the M&A and ECM landscape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thank you for that.
And then one more on credit here -- so it seems as though we had 30-day delinquency rate actually go down quarter over quarter. So it seems like maybe -- in the Card, sorry, business. So it seems like maybe it's a cure rate issue. Is that the right assumption? And then, could you give maybe a little color on how much the non-prime growth has been -- has driven in recent vintages versus prior?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I'm going to start with the second part of the question. So we are still very much concentrated in the prime and near-prime space, but we have a higher percentage of our origination in the near-prime space, reasonably meaningfully higher over the course of the last couple years.
So where we may have previously been, I think 40%, above 760. Now that's less than that, and there's more like 20% or 30% below 700. By the end of the day, still pristine credit, relatively speaking.
With respect to delinquencies, is it a cure rate issue? Not specifically, no.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Marianne. I'm not sure if this is too early, but when you think about expenses longer term beyond this year, if you think about 2017, if we find ourselves in a similar revenue environment next year, when you wrap in your cost save objectives and where you want to be on investment spend, do you think you'll be shooting for expenses to be kind of in the same range of that $56 billion next year, if things don't change on the revenue front?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're not really doing much in the way of 2017 guidance right now. It will ultimately honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers.
I think we're at a very good run rate of investments. We've increased reasonably significantly in terms of marketing dollars and also lease growth. That will drive profitability in the medium to longer term.
So it's possible, if we see the opportunity to continue to do that, we would do it. But we have no specific guidance yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revenue environment can change reasonably quickly, particularly, as you know, with rates, and to a lesser degree, markets. We're not going to overreact to a short-term phenomenon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Just more near term, you talked at a recent conference about the tax rate going forward. Just with the kind of issues you had this quarter with the tax rate, looking at 39%, you said it would 36%. What should we think about going forward? Is it like in that 36%?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, taxes much -- generally speaking, the reserve changes are somewhat episodic. Outside of those, yes, 36% is a good central case for our managed tax rate.

Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne, I had a question on the outlook. You reaffirmed the fee income guidance of $50 billion, plus or minus, for the full year. I'm trying to gauge, just given the tough start to the year in trading in 1Q, the subdued second-half M&A commentary, and second-half trading seasonality that we would typically expect, the $50 billion target does appear somewhat ambitious. I didn't know if you felt like that was a fair assessment, or just given what you're seeing across the businesses, that the $50 billion is still ready achievable?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So starting with the qualification that obviously, as you suggested, it's going to be market dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave the guidance that we would expect the second half to be seasonally lower. So here's what I would say -- first half, market challenged; second half, markets better. Net-net, first quarter markets challenged; second quarter better. Net-net, first half relatively flat year over year. So, call it a wash, with the acknowledgement that we knew we would expect seasonal declines in the second half of the year.
Mortgage better -- so you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year on year, actually by a reasonably significant amount. Given obviously where the rate environment is, as well as some positive MSR results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat. And against that, to your point, lower IB fees and lower Asset Management revenues, given the environment.
The way I would characterize it is there are puts and takes, but net-net it's still a reasonable central case. So we are not changing it. But it's market dependent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Marianne. One more for me on CCAR -- given that you've had some time to digest the latest set of results, the improvement in PNR was probably the most impressive aspect of the release, at least based on our own findings. From what you can gather, based on your own internal assessment, what were the primary drivers of the increase where maybe we have some limited visibility, such as areas like op risk? And does a favorable CCAR outcome inform your view in terms of which constraint is currently most binding and maybe how you might change your deployment tact across the different businesses?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I would say if you look at the last three years of PPNR, notwithstanding that there have been obviously differences in the scenarios, 2015 CCAR results, so not this year's but last year's, were low. Not to say that means that these results are more normal. I would say if you look at the three years and look at the PPNR results now, it's more consistent with the sort of portfolio risks, revenue generation we would expect. And you can see that because it's much more consistent with our results.
So I don't have insights that I can share with you specifically to try and reconcile the Fed's results year on year, nor do we really try to do that. You're right -- operational risk is likely a piece of it. And that was disclosed in that information. So I would just say, there can be volatility but I feel like this is not an unreasonable place to think the PPNR would start, and it's consistent as you can see, relatively speaking with what we calculated.
In respect to what that means for what's most binding, what it does mean is if you look at the analysis that we've done a couple of years in a row now, where we've said using the CCAR results from the Fed, what would that imply a CET1 ratio would need to be to pass, it had previously been a little less than 11%. With the improved PPNR and, therefore, the improved result, at this point, it would be a little less than 10%.
So in that context, as we sort of look forward, sometime in the near future, maybe in the third quarter, to getting the sort of 2017 CCAR changes in proposed form hopefully, it will alleviate to a degree a little bit of that pressure. But I still would suggest to you, as we said at Investor Day, that CCAR may, depending on how the G-SIB surcharge is included in the minimum, may become binding, if not likely will become binding. And so we'll continue to take that into consideration as we go forward. And we are already taking it into consideration as we think about optimizing against the multiple binding constraints we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Kleinhanzl,  Keefe, Bruyette & Woods - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A quick question on the mortgage originations -- the correspondent channel didn't change all that much quarter on quarter, although I would have thought with seasonality and a pick-up in refis, that would have increased in the second quarter. Could you talk about how you're thinking about correspondent mortgage originations? And given that refi volume looks strong at the start of the third quarter, should we expect a pick-up in correspondent in the third quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We think about using all of our channels based upon obviously the demand, and our capacity and our appetite to want to continue to close strongly for our customers. We've obviously also been focused in the anticipation of it becoming a more purchase-oriented market very much on building out the retail channel and the retail distribution channel, and that's been very successful.
So there's less correspondent contribution this quarter. It is a lever we will likely use going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Kleinhanzl,  Keefe, Bruyette & Woods - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And I know you can't really discuss too much on the legal side, but is there a right way to think about legal expenses going forward, like an ordinary cost of doing business for a bank your size? Is it 1% of revenues as kind of an ongoing run rate for expected legal expenses going forward, or is there not the right way to think about it and it's just episodic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this point, I'd still say -- at this point, we would still say it will be episodic. And while we are hopeful that the overall structural costs will start coming down, or has come down, and that's a good thing, there will still be potentially some puts and takes in the legal space.
There's no real way obviously of forecasting a run rate. I would just do what many of you have done, I think, and go back and look at what the legal expense looked like in the years preceding the crisis, and make your own determination whether it's going to be structurally a little higher. But it probably wouldn't be multiples of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Ken.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. Good morning.
Marianne, I was wondering just if you could -- I know it's a little backward-looking now and you've made your points already about what normal trading seasonality could be, but could you help us understand the products that drove the really strong [FIC trading] and kind of what happened in June? Was it volumes? Was it spreads widening? And then I guess I would actually ask what you typically consider what normal JPMorgan seasonality is, as you mentioned?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So it was particularly strong in rates, but nevertheless also very strong year over year in currencies, emerging markets, credit trading, [SPG]. So it was pretty broad-based.
But remember, you also have to think about it relative to the equivalent course of last year, and we didn't have a particularly strong second quarter last year. So on a relative basis, that is an important factor, but it was pretty broad-based -- more volume than anything.
And then seasonality, I'm sorry -- look, it's anyone's guess. I think you can go back and look over time. But last year we saw -- we had a weak second quarter, as I said. So we didn't see as much seasonality. But if you look at the last quarter's run rate, I don't know that would be a bad place to start -- last year's third quarter run rate would not be a bad place to start.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies LLC - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood, okay.
The second question just is -- on the wholesale reserve, you mentioned -- it's been nice to see the energy prices start to stabilize, and it seems like you're able to stabilize the amount of reserve build outstanding, aside from that one credit. What needs to happen for you to get even more comfortable, where you could see some of that reserve start to come out, underneath the context of that you're also growing the wholesale business extremely fast as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to start with a couple of general comments, which is, we talked about the fact that the charge-offs that we've experienced in the quarter were credits that we had previously reserved for. So we're at the point now where at least as a sort of basic matter as we're experiencing charge-offs, we feel like we're in a reasonably good reserve position, notwithstanding that idiosyncratically there may be additional adds.
What we would need to see is continued firming of sentiment in the sector, continued access to capital markets to allow companies to repair their balance sheets, and continued stabilization if not improvement in oil and gas prices. And so everything is constructive on that path, but it needs to continue along the same path.
And yes, we are growing our portfolio. And so even if it were not for energy, we would, all other things equal, be adding to reserves, but there are also time to (inaudible) pay down -- a lot of puts and takes, too.

Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Marianne. Thank you.
Marianne, can you give us some color -- obviously your consumer loan growth has picked up quite nicely. You pointed to, it's going to be at the higher end of the range for the year. What are you guys seeing on consumer behavior? Has it improved and they feel stronger about their own job prospects, which is enabling them to borrow more? Are there any metrics that you guys are looking at from that end?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, I mean, just to say -- we obviously have our own spend data to look at, and it continues -- the Card spend is up 8% year on year. Energy continues to be a tailwind for consumers. The labor market continues to be solid and improving. And sentiment is still good. Housing, still improving.
So I mean, really just looking at the same things you're looking at, and we obviously have a slightly different lens to it. But all other things equal, consumers are in very good shape, and demand is there for the product. And we've been investing outside of consumer in new products -- inside Consumer, sorry -- in the Freedom Unlimited space and also in marketing. We're growing, not only because the demand is there but also because we're investing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I see. And coming back to credit, obviously your first-quarter results had the results of the targeted shared national credit exam for oil. Traditionally obviously we have the shared national credit exam every year. Second-quarter results normally reflect that exam.
Do your second-quarter results reflect the shared national credit exam? Or is that going to -- ?

Eric Wasserstrom,  Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, thanks. Marianne, just a couple of quick follow-ups on the auto lending business -- the originations came down a bit. And you talked about the dynamics around that previously in the quarter and at the Investor Day.
When I poll auto lender or auto dealers, they say that where they had primarily seen you retreat was from very high FICO, sort of super-prime new lending and leasing, but that their experience with Chase remained very consistent in the mid-FICO range. I just wanted to see if that was consistent with your view internally?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not specifically. I'm not sure; I haven't polled the dealers myself. We continue to have very high FICO scores. I'm not aware of that, but I can't comment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  Guggenheim Securities LLC - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Just one follow-up on auto credit -- obviously the Manheim issue points to perhaps some rising severity, given default. But at this stage, is there anything that suggests to you that we should see a higher frequency of default?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR Capital Markets - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you very much. One of the things about what we saw as mortgage rates -- I mean, the 10-year dropping down to record levels and mortgage rates probably following right behind it -- can you give us a little outlook? Are you seeing an uptick in refi's? We've seen the refi indexes go up very high. Any outlook on where you think the mortgage market's going to be in the next quarter or two?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we are expecting refi to be stronger in the coming quarters; and the mortgage market, as best we can tell, will be at around $1.7 trillion, $1.8 trillion this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR Capital Markets - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the other follow-up question is -- there's some news articles out there about JPMorgan securitizing conforming loans. This hasn't really been done a lot by anybody. I don't know if you can address that, the economics behind that, or what's the thought behind that, instead of getting Fannie and Freddie wraps, you're securitizing them yourself?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we've done one, and we're looking at more securitizations in the mortgage space. And we are keeping a vertical stripe. We're retaining the loans on our balance sheet -- or the securities on our balance sheet, I should say. And in doing that we've been able to get private capital to take the majority of the lower credit risk and get better capital treatment for ourselves, in terms of the RWA that it attracts.

Marty Mosby,  Vining Sparks - Analyst    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. Wanted to ask you a little bit about the focus everybody has on the flattening of the Treasury curve, but yet earlier you were able to say that going into next year you would see 2016 NII growth of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, only really fall to $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which means that flattening of the yield curve is very manageable. Just talk about asset yields as your earning asset yield actually went up 1 basis point -- what you've been able to see in the market versus what's happening in the Treasury curve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll just start by sort of orientating you on why that would be the impact for us. If you look at our balance sheet and you look at what we have in fixed rate loans versus what we have in either IOER or in LIBOR loans, it's about $650 billion. So we're much more sensitive to the front end of the rate curve.
If you look at our earnings at risk disclosures, a 100-basis-point parallel shift would be around $800 million. And so obviously we haven't seen, and won't hopefully see, anything of that order of magnitude. That kind of gives you an ability to size up, notwithstanding compounding, why you've only seen our NII relative to prior expectations come down by that much.

In this particular quarter, your funding costs went up. Is that a lag effect from what the rate hike in December still just now coming through, or was there something else maybe more unusual about the funding cost that we saw that drove the margin down this particular quarter?

So I think earlier on the call somebody else asked the question, and I made the comment that it's really more related to the results from our hedges of non-dollar debt, long-term debt. And so in the first quarter, the dollar weakened. In the second quarter, it strengthened. And with some currency basis in the first quarter that we didn't see in the second quarter, it really is, not to dismiss it, but it really is accounting and nothing really else than that.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.

Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, again. Just a follow-up on the Card new originations -- I know one of the key things that you've done for many years is to focus on relationship lending, relationship offerings. And so when I hear that 20% of the new originations are below a FICO of 700, is that a shift from the relationship strategy that you have or does it reflect the fact that you do have significant relationships on deposits, et cetera, with folks in that FICO band?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No shift from our desire to want to be with engaged customers and our rewards programs. Our products are all geared towards that. So it's really just a credit decision. And, yes, we do have relationships with many, many customers in that still near-prime space.

Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. As a follow-up, Marianne, your consumer business obviously has been very, very strong. Can you share with us the update on clearXchange? It's expected to be rolled out later this year, and what that might do to even grow the mobile business even more than it's growing now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase - CFO    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So look, obviously P2P real-time payments is very important to our customers, so therefore it's important to us. It's also important for us on the industry that it's done in a safe and secure way.
And so early warning, the fraud protection that they are able to provide, as well as bank-level cyber security and the absence of a need to provide your bank credentials we think is very strongly positive for our customers. And we expect to see volume go across that.
As you know, we have QuickPay already, and we saw reasonably significant volume, $21 billion, on QuickPay last year and growing. So I would expect to see more and more P2P payments. And it's good for our customers, it's good for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase - Chairman & CEO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you look at the whole payment space, Chase Paymentech is gaining share. Chase Net is doing very well. Chase Pay, we've signed up lots of different people. One piece of that is the P2P.
Today, right now, if you use Chase QuickPay, it's very easy within Chase to Chase. It's now just as easy to go from Chase to a bunch of other banks, who I won't name now. We've just started rolling out -- it's soon to be rolled out to 60% of American banking accounts.
And then we're going to make it available to all banks. So you will be able to go P2P, real time, through Chase QuickPay, there will be a special app for Chase QuickPay. It'll also be branded under another name, which we haven't rolled out yet, which I think will be rolled out shortly.
I think it's a great success that the banks can get together and do this. This will be great service, which I think shows you the banks making progress on what you would have called prior fintech.
