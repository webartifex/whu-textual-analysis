Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's second quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby. 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website; and please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation. 
So turning to page 1, we carried strong momentum into the second quarter, with net income of $6.5 billion and an EPS of $1.60 a share on revenue of $26 billion, up 13% year-on-year and flat versus a seasonally strong first quarter, with a return on tangible common equity of 17%.  And you can see on the page that we've highlighted several significant items up front here. A $950 million reserve release in mortgage.  And this quarter we saw net charge-offs less than 50%  of what they were a year ago. A $550 million reserve release in Card, with charge-offs remaining historically low; and $600 million of expenses for additional litigation reserves in Corporate. In addition, the results for the quarter included a $355 million DVA gain in the Corporate and Investment Bank. 
Outside of these four items, we had a number of other smaller items, both positive and negative in the quarter, which offset each other, many of which I'll call out as we go through the presentation.  And we want to be very transparent with you, we don't count items like reserve releases and other non-core items when we think about our own performance.  So if we adjust for all of these items both big and small, our return on tangible common equity would have been about 15%, reflecting strong underlying core performance. 
This quarter, a couple of important themes, the Markets environment in June, as well as several capital developments. But just a quick note on each. Rising long term rates and higher levels of volatility in June have an impact both on the quarter as well as in terms of our mortgage outlook guidance. Our Market businesses held up well in June and our Asset Management platform outperformed during the backup.  And importantly, remember that given the firm's positioning, rising rates will drive significant benefits in higher NII over time. However, in the near term, higher long term rates and wider spreads drove a significant reduction in the unrealized gains in our securities portfolio, or a reduction in AOCI, which did impact Basel III capital negatively. Despite that impact, we were able to add to our capital and improve capital ratios as we began to realize some of the run-off and model benefits that we've previously guided you to.  And finally, higher rates will have a significant impact on mortgage refi volumes and margins in the second half of the year. 
On capital, we've added a new page in the debt on leverage, which I'll cover in a moment; but our headline capital number is a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 9.3%, including the impact of the final Basel III capital rules approved this month by our regulators. In general, the approvals were the same or similar to the NPRs, and in that sense were broadly in line with our expectations, including the confirmation of no exception for AOCI. The estimated impact on our ratio was a modest benefit. 
So on page 3 let me take you through the details. We ended the quarter with Basel III Tier 1 common of $148 billion, up from the prior quarter. We've put a Basel III capital walk here on the page in the blue call out box, which steps you through each component of the change quarter-on-quarter. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio before the impact of final US rules increased to 9.1% from 8.9%,  even after the 20 basis points impact from the change in AOCI. This impact was offset by a $40 billion reduction in risk -weighted assets, reflecting impact of portfolio run-off as well as lower levels of risk. So then adding in the benefit of final rules, which was principally related to changes in MSR rules and securitization benefits, our ratio at the quarter end was estimated at 9.3%.  And as you know, although we reflect our best understanding of all the rules in our ratio, we don't pull forward the impact of passive run-off or model enhancements, some of which we saw this quarter. Together, these will deliver approximately an additional 75 basis points of benefits by the end of 2014; and we remain committed to reaching a 9.5% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio by year-end. 
Briefly on liquidity.  In addition to building our capital, we accelerated compliance with the proposed Basel III liquidity coverage rules.  And not only did we become compliant with the rule during the quarter, but at quarter end, our estimated ratio was 118%, and we feel great about the progress we've made. Although there can be short-term volatility in the number, you should expect that we will run around this level going forward. And to finish on page 3 in the bullets, the Board increased the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share from the previous $0.30; and during the quarter we repurchased $1.2 billion of common equity. As a reminder, that's $1.2 billion of the $6 billion CCAR authorization. 
So turning to page 4, we've added this page to help walk you through our current thoughts on the new proposals regarding Basel III leverage. Let me start with two things. We believe the leverage ratio is an appropriate complement to a Tier 1 common ratio if properly calibrated, and our Holding Company leverage ratio is estimated at 4.7% at the end of the quarter, based upon the US proposed rules.  And to be clear, these rules do not reflect the most recent Basel proposal which would further increase our leverage balance sheet. Just a few comments on the proposal in the US. The denominated build on GAAP assets with add-ons for derivative potential future exposures and off-balance sheet commitments, resulting in a gross up for us of approximately $1 billion.  And remember, included on our balance sheet is over $450 billion of cash and other high quality liquid assets, which we think there's a strong argument that they should not attract capital at these levels. 
So I'm going to take you through the analysis on the page. We started with analysts' estimates for net income, and we held our dividend flat and assumed repurchases generally consistent with our current levels. Given those assumptions, we would be able to add approximately 60 basis points to the leverage ratio by the end of 2014. Additionally, we will continue to recalibrate our Tier 1 capital through the issuance of preferreds.  And finally, we will take appropriate actions to reduce our leverage assets, which may include some of the points on the slide, for example, repricing or restructuring of commitments or unwinding certain derivative positions.  And if you take those together, this could add another approximately 100 basis points over time, for a total of up to 160 basis points. So we will adjust our business, but we do expect the Holding Company to be able to be compliant in early 2015, with the bank to follow. Of course, a caution that the timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules which are not yet final. 
Changing gears, let's turn to the business performance, starting on page 5 with Consumer and Community Banking.  The combined Consumer businesses generated $3.1 billion of net income for the quarter on $12 billion of revenue, with an ROE of 27%. Just a quick look at the franchise. We ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches, over 19,000 ATMs, and we now have nearly 1,700 Chase Private Client locations. We continue to see really strong growth in the underlying drivers for the Consumer businesses. Deposits were up over $40 billion year-on-year, an increase of 10%, customer attrition levels remain historically low, and our active mobile customer base grew by 32% year-on-year.  So we're adding customers, we're retaining them through superior customer experience, and we're deepening our relationships with them. Also, Mortgage and Auto originations showed strong growth, up 12% and 17% year-on-year respectively; and we have record Credit Card sales volumes of $105 billion, up 10% year-on-year, and record client investment assets of $172 billion, up 16%. 
Turning to page 6, Consumer and Business Banking. Net income of close to $700 million and an ROE of 25% on net revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter. While we continue to see pressure on deposit margins, five basis points down in the quarter, this continues to be largely offset by very strong growth.  And on the non-interest revenue side, we're seeing strong growth in both debit and investment revenue. Expenses are up year-on-year, reflecting the investments we're making in the business, including branch builds, as well as the absence of some one-time items that benefited the prior year. 
During the quarter, we had record Investment sales of $9.5 billion, up 53% year-on-year.  And a note that approximately 70% of those sales are managed money, driving strong recurring revenue for the business up 13% year-on-year. Average business banking loan balances are flat quarter-on-quarter, up 4% versus last year; and you can see here in the drivers that the loan production stabilized just above the very low levels we saw in the first quarter. We believe that we are maintaining share despite increased competition; and the pipeline is up relative to the first quarter, which should support origination levels in the second half of the year. 
Turning to page 7 and Mortgage Banking. Overall Mortgage Banking net income was $1.1 billion, with an ROE of 23%. At the top of the table, looking at the first blue highlighted line, reduction in pretax income was $582 million. Top line production revenue, excluding repurchases, was up slightly quarter-on-quarter, with a higher reported gain on sale pretax margin of 116 basis points more than offsetting lower closed loan volumes, down 7%. $49 billion of mortgage production saw a change in mix this quarter, as the purchase market continued to recover. 
Our purchase volumes increased over 40% quarter-on-quarter and contributed 36% to volumes, up from 23% last quarter.  And despite the strong start in April, the environment in late May and June drove mortgage rates up significantly, around 100 basis points. This pressure has continued into July and we expect it could have a significant impact on the refinance market side in the second half of the year.  So if mortgage rates stay at or above current levels, the market could be reduced by an estimated 30% to 40%. Although we will adjust capacity, expense reductions will lag volume reductions and will challenge profitability and production. 
Moving down to Servicing, pretax income of $133 million, up quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, on lower expenses and modest gain in the MSR. Servicing expenses of $715 million decreased quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations, and we continue to see Servicing, or expect Servicing costs, to decrease to $600 million by the fourth quarter. At the bottom of the table, Real Estate portfolio pretax was $1.2 billion.  Run-off of the legacy portfolio continued; although in the quarter, given the positive economics of retaining certain loans, we added close to $5 billion of mortgage loans to our portfolio, which is up $1.3 billion quarter-on-quarter, and we expect to be able to sustain these levels in the second half. 
On Credit, delinquencies and foreclosure in our portfolio are each down around 10% quarter-on-quarter. Net charge-offs continue to come down, less than $300 million this quarter, which was in line with our guidance, and we released $950 million of reserves. The majority of this release related to the impact of lower severities, reflecting real and sustainable HTI improvement. Going forward, we expect quarterly net charge-offs of less than $250 million; and as credit trends continue to improve, expect additional reserve releases in the next several quarters. 
Turning to Card Merchant Services and Auto on page 8. Net income of $1.2 billion, up 21% year-on-year, with an ROE of 32%, or 23% if you exclude reserve releases, reflecting excellent underlying performance in the business. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year-on-year, and despite strong volumes, down slightly quarter-on-quarter as a result of spread compression. In Card, year-on-year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was strong and consistent, at 10% and 15% respectively.  And importantly, we saw a stabilization of outstandings at the end of the second quarter after 15 quarters of net run-off.  And we believe we've reached an inflection point and expect some modest growth from here. 
Expenses are down year-on-year, primarily driven by lower remediation expenses on our legacy product. And the net charge-off rate continues to be very low and we released $550 million of credit card loan loss reserves this quarter. This reflected both the continued improvement in early stage roll rates, as well as higher than expected levels of pay downs on modified loans. The net charge-off rate was 3.31%, down over 100 basis points year-on-year.  And if we continue to see favorable roll rates, as well as our modified loans continuing to pay down, we will see incremental reserve releases in the second half of 2013. And before we move on, a few words on Auto. Originations up 17% year-on-year, reflecting market share gains and driving loan balances up 5%. 
Moving on to slides 9 and 10 and the Corporate Investment Bank. A strong second quarter performance, which included a DDA gain of $355 million. This was versus a gain in the same quarter of last year of $755 million, both of which are shown in the credit adjustments line. As usual, we'll focus on the numbers excluding DDA. $2.6 billion of net income was the highest second quarter net income since 2009, up 37% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter. Revenue of $9.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year, and the business delivered an ROE of 19%. Total banking revenue was $3.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year, on higher IDCs of $1.7 billion, up 38%, primarily driven by strong debt and equity underwriting. We continue to be Bank Number 1 year-to-date in IDCs; and despite weaker credit markets towards the end of the quarter, we have near record debt underwriting fees in the first half of 2013.  And equity capital markets, we have the Number 1 wallet share for the first half of the year. 
Moving on to Markets revenue, which was up 18% year-on-year in line with our guidance, a very strong performance, particularly given the challenging environment in June, reflecting strong client flows throughout the quarter, the diversification of the business and trading risk discipline. Fixed Income Markets revenue of $4.1 billion was up 17% year-on-year, with credit and spread-related products benefiting from less Euro zone uncertainty and a stronger US housing market. Equity Markets of $1.3 billion was up 24% year-on-year, with strong client flows in cash and equity derivatives.  And before we leave Markets, just a quick update on OTC clearing. The implementation of Phase II in June went very smoothly, although volumes were relatively light at launch, we have seen activity pick up and we feel we have the right level of participation. Security Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 1% year-on-year, and within this number, you should note growth in custody fees is in line with asset growth, but is offset by declines in agent lending as well as lower volumes in clearance and capital management. 
Just a comment on credit. Trends are stable at low levels, with small net recoveries for the quarter. Loans were down 6% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower balances in trade and conduits; and expenses were up 8% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher comp on higher revenues, with a comp to revenue ratio excluding DDA of 31% for the quarter. Finally on this page, at the bottom of the driver section, you see the CIB average VAR which continued to decline to $40 million, reflecting generally lower levels of risk but also lower volatility across asset classes. A note that the increased volatility in June did, however, drive spot VAR up higher to over $50 million. Before we skip over page 10, just a comment. If you take a look at the numbers for the first half of 2013, you can see we continued to make great progress in the international space and had particular strength in Asia during this quarter. 
Turning to page 11. Commercial Banking saw net income of $621 million on revenue of $1.7 billion, with an ROE of 18%. Revenue was up 3% quarter-on-quarter, despite the softer lending environment driven by higher average loan balances, stable spreads, and positive momentum on cross-sale and IDCs. Although end of period loans were flat this quarter, we saw very strong growth in Commercial Real Estate, up 3% and gaining share, offset by lower corporate lending.  Our clients have excess cash and are keeping their utilization rate low, but we've also seen the continuation of competitive pricing and aggressive structuring. We're holding the line and choosing quality over growth; and this, of course, is reflected in our strong credit performance.  But we're still adding very good clients and doing many more business with our existing clients. As we look forward, we expect continued strong growth in the Real Estate business, given our competitive position.  And for C&I loans, pipelines are up from the first quarter and deal activity feels like it may be turning. We are expecting a more constructive second half, and therefore should see some growth; but the environment remains competitive. 
Turning to page 12 and Asset Management. An excellent quarter, and despite challenging markets in June, we saw net income of $500 million, up 28% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, with an ROE of 22%. $2.7 billion of revenue, up 15% year-on-year, reflects an increase in management fees driven by strong long-term net inflows, $25 billion this quarter, marking the 17th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows; and higher equity in Fixed Income markets, up 12% based on our business mix. We also saw higher performance fees, driven by strong fund returns, and record loan balances, up $16 billion year-on-year across products and geographies. 
A moment on expenses. Growth and performance in the business led to 11% year over year expense growth.  But as our investments season, the business is delivering positive operating leverage, which you can see in the pretax margin which is 30%, up from 27% last year. We ended the quarter with assets under management of $1.5 trillion, up 9% year-on-year, and client assets of $2.2 trillion, up 10%, despite small net outflows in June. However, the breadth of our platform should enable us to continue to gather net new assets globally looking forward, and we delivered strong relative performance in both Fixed Income and Equities. 
Moving on to page 13 and Corporate and Private Equity. A net loss of $552 million for the quarter.  Private Equity generated net income of just over $200 million, which included over $400 million of gains, in part driven by investments that are in active sales discussions. Treasury and CIO net loss was $429 million, driven by negative NII due to continued low rates and slower reinvestment, as well as a change in portfolio mix, shifting from higher yielding securities to LCR-eligible securities and cash. The results also included net securities gains and a modest loss on (Inaudible) redemption which we guided to last quarter. Excluding the net of these two items, CIO Treasury will have generated a net loss of about $350 million, which is generally in line with our guidance; and our quarterly guidance remains unchanged. 
Finally, Other Corporate. A net loss of $335 million includes the $600 million of pretax expense for additional litigation reserve in the quarter. Excluding litigation, Other Corporate was around $100 million net income, in line with our guidance.  And again, our guidance, which does exclude litigation and significant items, remains unchanged for Other Corporate. 
Turning to page 14 and net interest margin. Net interest income was down slightly and core NIM was down 23 basis points quarter-on-quarter. We acknowledge this is larger than you may have expected, but let me give you some color. Importantly, it was principally a result of actions we took to build liquidity to comply with Basel requirements more quickly, which we believe is a strong positive; and to a degree, it was also our pull forward compression we guided to over time. So we've added a table on this slide which shows our cash balances and how they progress over time, and what you can see circled is that our cash was up more than $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, with other interest-earning assets being broadly flat. This changed the relative mix and also the size of our interest-earning assets and drove core NIM down the 18 basis points we circled on the page. While the increase in cash does reflect accelerated LCR compliance, it does also reflect very strong deposit growth and slower reinvestments and a little less robust loan growth. The balance of the reduction in NIMs relates to loan yield compression, partially offset by the lower cost of debt.  So going forward, all else being equal, what we expect from here is relatively stable NIM in the second half of the year and net interest income to increase modestly next quarter. 
So finally on slide 15, here's our outlook. I've covered these items as we went through the presentation.  So in wrap up, overall a very strong quarter, returning 17% on tangible common equity with excellent underlying performance across businesses, while making significant progress on capital and liquidity ratios; and the firm overall is positioned to benefit from a higher rate environment. 
Thank you for joining us. Operator, you can open up the call for Q&A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Operator Instructions)  
Our first question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.  Hello, Marianne. I was wondering if you could -- do you have any sense that you could give us of where you stand on the leverage ratio at the bank level today relative to the 6% requirement? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello, John. Good morning. So we don't disclose the bank leverage ratio.  But it is lower than the Holding Company, so we would have a further way to go.  As we said, we intend to be compliant at the Holding Company level by the beginning of 2015 and work on bank compliance shortly thereafter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  So shortly thereafter, maybe within a quarter or two? Can you give us any feel there, or -- just to get a sense of --? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    John, obviously the rules are fairly new, and still a proposal and not final.  So there's work to do before they get finalized. We're working through all of the things we'd need to do to comply. I would say we would aim to be compliant by the end of 2015, but we need to go do more detailed plans and we'll get back to you with some more specifics. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And you mentioned the mitigation you can do at the Holding Company. Is there mitigation you can also do to help specifically the bank level ratio in terms of assets that could be shifted to the parent or equity that could go from the Hold Company to the sub and things like that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, all of those things could be considered and would be considered. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And then on the liquidity ratio, why have you decided to run with this level of cushion to LCR and why the acceleration in getting there now? Anything driving that, in particular? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So in terms of the cushion, while it's not scientific, there is a volatility in that number inherent in actually deposit flows.  So we do see some things in deposit flows, particularly wholesale flows, and that could span a quarter end and drive the ratio up or down some.  So it's prudent to run at a ratio above 100% and around about this level.  And just in terms of acceleration, we just wanted to get there more quickly.  The opportunity presented itself, so nothing more than that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And could you give us some of the assumptions behind your outlook for stable net interest margin and modest net interest income growth in the back half of the year, just in terms of what you're assuming on rates and loan growth, and what are the puts and takes on your outlook? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's a great question, John, because as you alluded to in the question, there's a large number of moving parts in terms of the forecast, including points of yield on rates, which as you know have been choppy over the last several weeks.  So we base our projections on modest loan growth and on our understanding of the implied rate curves and that they could all -- they could change.  Also deposit flows, as you've seen, have been very, very strong.  So we accelerated our LCR compliance back to the majority of the NIM compression we were previously expecting and guiding you to forward; and consequently, we expect to be more stable, with some loan yield compression being offset by lower cost of debt. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And then finally, I'm not sure if I saw it in here or not, but can you remind us how much you benefit from higher rates?  And which rates in particular are most helpful for you, if you can delineate between the 10-year and the shorter based rates? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'll just give you two data points, and then you can maybe go and have a look at them.  But I think in the Q, we disclose a couple of things. The first is a bit of a sweetener which says that over 12 months, it would deliver about $900 million of additional NII. It's not exactly what we've seen, but-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's the 10-year going up 100 basis points. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's right.  That's the 10-year going up 100 basis points.  I'm sorry.  And that's not exactly what we've seen, but it's the closest thing to what we're seeing right now.  And then the other thing we've disclosed is on a parallel shift of 100 basis points, so if your short rates go up 2%, that would deliver just over $2 billion over 12 months.  And not to say that recurs, but it takes time to build up to that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And that's interest rates only, not Mortgage volume, Investment Banking volume.  That's just isolating interest rates only, assuming the Company invests the way we're planning to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then that's current numbers, that's last Q or that's as of right now? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Those were the numbers from the last Q, and they are not meaningfully changed right now. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And last thing for me, on reserve release, how can we gauge, if it is possible at all, how long this can go on for? Are there any base metrics that you think you can't go below that we could look at as a percent of loans or a percent of normalized charge-offs? Any help you can give us to gauge how much might be left on reserve release front? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  So John, I would point you to -- and I can't remember the page, I apologize -- but we put a page in Investor Day that talked about what we thought through the cycle charge-off rates were for each of our businesses.  And so what I would do is look at -- take NCI loans and a reserve balance at the end of the period of $3.3 billion, take a look at that page and figure out what a more normal sort of charge-off rate, and therefore reserve balance, would be.  And that will be in large part a reduction over the course of the next several quarters.  So we expect it to be a journey to get to that level throughout 2014. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And wholesale, we're kind of where we should be. We shouldn't expect much different. Credit Card, maybe a little bit more, but put that in the hundreds of millions.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And on Mortgage, I think we said Investment Day, eventually it will be $1 billion to $1.5 billion, within a couple years. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And PCI, if we have home improvement, we may see some reduction in PCI loan loss reserves.  Purchase credit (Inaudible).   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You haven't done that yet in terms of taking the PCI out yet, right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, we haven't done that yet, John.  But the reserve release we took at NCI was driven in large part by lower severity.  So if this continues, you might see some of that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John  McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great.  Okay.  Thank you.

    Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So another quick question on leverage. Could you help me understand why it takes until Q1 '15 for the Bank Holding Company to add the 30 basis points necessary to the leverage ratio? It looks like what you laid out puts you well above that earlier. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  So Brennan, what we laid on the page was an illustration. And you're absolutely right. What it shows you is that we want to be able to close that gap much more quickly, and so that might very well be what happens. We just aren't coming out now with a target of achieving it over the course of the next one or two quarters, because we have other objectives, including the continuation of being able to have some capital distributions to you guys that we want to be able to decide when we do CCAR at the end of the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We'll be able to do it pretty quickly when we know what it actually is. We don't want to start making actions that affect customers way in advance of knowing the real final rules. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But what you took away from the page was absolutely right. Closing that gap should not be difficult and could be more quick than this, but we wanted to be cautious. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Understood.  Thanks.  And was there a change in the securities portfolio during the quarter, and maybe could you give us an update on where that duration stands? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  So we're not going to disclose the duration, but there was some changes in the portfolio as we moved out of non-eligible into eligible securities for LCR and also maintained more cash.  So there were some changes. We also, as you saw, are making gains on sale and we were doing that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So would the bias be to assume that it would be towards shorter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Remember, when rates go up, certain mortgages lengthen and a whole bunch of different things take place.  But in general, the portfolio is several year duration, a couple years duration, AA-plus;  and obviously, it changes over time to manage into short exposures. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And then just a quick follow-up on John's question. Is it generally right, given what you guys have disclosed and what you guys just verified and what we've seen in rates, if we assume that rates kind of stay where they're at, that you would get about 75% of that $900 million additional NII in 2014, if we stay status quo to where we are now? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's not a bad assumption. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All things being equal.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All things being equal, yes.  (Laughter).  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right.  All things are never equal, but --  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Exactly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then last one, just trying to think about maybe the potential to avoid some of the really big distraction that we saw this quarter around what is sort of becoming an annual event at the shareholder vote. Have you guys considered maybe articulating some kind of plan or a blue print or a map or what have you to get people comfortable with the future state of CEO Chairman roles way down the line when there is sort of a succession that is in place? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Board -- we're not going to tell you what Board deliberations are.  But the Board obviously has  talked to shareholders, a bunch of ideas.  And also, we think we have some of the best corporate governance out there, including -- which I think is more important than the separation of Chairman and CEO -- that the Board should make the decision based on the circumstance of the time.  They know the Company, the strategy, the people, that the Board always meets without the CEO, the Board in total sets the agenda, the Board is completely engaged in CEO compensation, the Board can hire and fire the CEO at will.  And those practices, some are in our charters, some are not.  But hopefully, it won't be the distraction it was last year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brennan Hawken,  UBS - Analyst    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, let's hope so. Thanks for the answers.

    Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello.  Thanks.  Good morning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello, Betsy. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So one more question on page 4. Your $4.7 million is really close.  We were looking for $4.5 million, so very much in line with what we're looking for. I'm just wondering why no bank sub disclosure.  I realize that it's different, but -- and I heard your answer earlier.  But I'm just wondering, why not just give us a number. Is it that there's too much uncertainty in estimating that denominator, you need understanding from the regulators as to what they're looking for?  Could you just help us out on a little bit of the qualitative reasons? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So Betsy, there's nothing underlying it.  Let me just give you, hopefully, enough. It is a little bit lower than $4.7 million.  And given that the ratio for the Bank Holding Company is 6%,  then the gap is a little bit bigger.  But measured in small terms of basis points, not more. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And a lot of it's historical, how JPMorgan Chase got built through mergers over time, what ended up in the bank, what ended up in broker dealers.  And we'll have to change our legal entities a little bit overseas.  So we'll have to modify our legal entities to accomplish our the objectives, and we'll be able to do that over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And over time, if we're able to push out, it will help.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Exactly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And remember, the overriding constraint is the 5%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I get that. If possible, I'd love to show you what our assumptions are and maybe we could understand where we differ. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, of course. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And then separately, you put on here on this page the potential further add-ons for the Basel proposal.  You're talking about the Basel consultative document that came out a couple weeks ago? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Is there any sense as to what kind of basis point hit that is? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're not going to disclose it today, Betsy, and we can reconsider that, because we think there is some pretty fundamental issues with some of those proposals, not least of which is the absence of FIN-41 netting or netting on match securities financing, which we believe and are hopeful is going to be resolved.  But it is a add-on and it's not insignificant. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the thing that I stress in derivative receivables but not taking benefit for collateral, which we know we get.  And there are a lot of issues in there that need to be looked at and analyzed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right, agreed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Betsy, to Brennan's earlier question, I think in the context of what we've laid out as illustratively being achievable, then timelines would solve the problem. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The other important point is one of the things that Basel and all this stuff is supposed to do is harmonize global rules. This is clearly no longer harmonization, where we have one part of the world is talking about two times, with another part of the world is talking about.  And I don't think there's any industry out there that would be comfortable with something like that in the long run.  Because in the long run, that has a lot of effects that you can't determine, quarter-by-quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  So part of the challenge is a higher denominator in one side and a higher ratio on the other side, right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just on HPI, HPI obviously rose significantly in the quarter. Could you give us an indication as to how much that helped RWAs? Was that a big piece of the driver? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The HPI improvement on RWA has a bit of a lag to it.  So while it did contribute to the reduction in our RWA, our reduction was principally run-off, and some model enhancement and some lower risk.  But in part, that lower risk was driven by better HCI. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So can you give us a sense as to given where HPI is today, what kind of benefit that would have on RWAs if there wasn't a lag? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, Betsy, it's a great question.  And we will get back to you after the call. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, cool.  Thank you.

    Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello, Matt. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just drilling down to some of the businesses here.  Obviously June, as you mentioned and we've all seen, was very volatile in the credit markets and the fixed income markets in general.  And I guess just a basic question, how did you do so well in fixed income? I know you commented early part of the month that things had deteriorated quite a bit, and I think some of us were surprised at how good it was in the quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So you know, June was a bit more challenging, and so it wasn't as strong as April and May.  But it really comes down to the fact that we really do have a client driven business model.  And the client flows, they held up.  And so if you surround that with robust and strong trading risk discipline, that's pretty much how it turned out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And I think our folks in Emerging Markets also did a spectacularly good job, because I think you might see some real differentiation there from some other folks when all their numbers come out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And is that just from managing a smaller inventory while the spreads were widening, or --? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A little of everything. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And I guess from the other side, when we look at the comp rate at the Investment Bank, it was down, I think, 2% to 3% both linked quarter and year over year. What's driving that? Is it mix, is it the streamlining of the business lines that you announced about a year ago fully coming together, or just paying people less? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think we've been very consistent in how we look at comp and how we accrue it and things like that, after capital charges and by line of business, type of business and such, that it's just a change of mix and a change of capital, et cetera. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And I think you've been guiding towards 35%? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Should we think that maybe it's the lower end of that that is more sustainable? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Possibly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  All right.  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [99]

    Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First, I just wanted to follow-up on the comment, so over the next 12 months NII should benefit by 75% of the $900 million?  So in other words, you should -- in 2014, you should benefit by about $700 million -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike, all other things being equal, that's not an unreasonable assumption.  But as we said before, things are never equal. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, I understand.  It's more art than science.  So I guess your run rate of net interest income, that would be about 1.5% of that.  Is that in the ballpark of how you think about it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'm sorry, Mike, say that again? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So that benefit would equal about 1.5% of net interest income? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I guess that's about right. Or maybe a little less.  A little less, Mike. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And when you say the benefit, it's the benefit of the 10-year increasing 100 basis points? I didn't fully hear how you explained that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I think we disclose all of the assumptions in the earnings risk tables in the 10-Q.  But yes, it's short rates staying low and the 10-year going up 100 basis points, I think. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, but it also drags up the five-year, the seven-year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  Yes.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So if you use one point, it's the 10-year.  But it's the yield curve going up steeply. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The reason I ask that is it seems as though maybe the 10-year is not as relevant as perhaps the five-year, or am I mistaken? Or the three-year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You're not mistaken, which is why if you actually get more of a parallel shift and short rates go up, our numbers go up by multiples. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Separately, the Investment Banking backlogs, where are they versus the first quarter, at the end? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The pipeline? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Activity levels picked up some, and we expect that to carry into the third quarter.  So a little better. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And you saw a real slowdown when we had the volatile markets in June, but we think that's not permanent, the markets kind of open up again.  You've seen a bunch of IPOs and debt deals and a lot of M&A chatter.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the leverage ratio, you said under the US rules, it's 4.7%. Under the proposed Basel rules, if adopted, where would the leverage ratio be? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [121]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We didn't disclose that, Mike, for a couple of reasons. One is that, as we said, the proposals, we think, have some fundamental issues to them.  But it would be lower. The gross up to our balance sheet on top of the 3.5% sitting on the page would not be insignificant,  but we didn't disclose it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you give us a ballpark?  Or is that one reason you're being so conservative, you have 160 basis point potential benefit, but you're still saying wait until early 2015. Is that part of your thought process? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, that is definitely one of the reasons.  And that's one of the reasons why we said, of course, the timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules, and that would be one of those changes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And then last question relates to the processing business, which to me looks like it's lagging for the second quarter in a row.  And I'm asking a more broad question.  For eight years, since Bank One merged with JPMorgan, and I think for a few decades before that, it was run as a separate business.  And the fourth quarter of last year, it was merged into the Investment Bank.  And now we have two quarters in a row of what looks like performance that will lag peer.  So my question is how is the management and organizational restructuring going? Is it impacting the processing business, or is there something else taking place there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First of all, I think it's going great.  And the folks in the field will tell you that they are seeing huge benefits from putting together the corporate Global Investment Bank, the corporate Investment Bank, Treasury Services.  But you are right. There's been flattening out a little bit in Treasury Services and Investor Services, which is mostly custody. Some of that's spread, some of that's margins.  So some of that will benefit also a little bit from rising rates.  And we don't know what the peers will show yet.  So maybe you do, but I don't know yet. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I'm guessing it's going to lag. The assets under custody down 2% link quarter when markets are up as much as they are, is there anything else that's one-time or unique? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike, I don't know.  And obviously, if we lag our peers, we'll be as disappointed as you are. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  CLSA - Analyst    [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  All right.  Thank you.

    Our next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. My first question really has to do with some of the initial questions asked on capital.  And what is the priority here on capital distribution versus leverage ratio? Is it compliance to the 5% at the Hold Co, or is it accelerating capital distribution over the next two years relative to what you announced out of this year's CCAR, or can JPMorgan both be compliant with the leverage ratio over time and accelerate buybacks and dividends? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [131]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Your last one. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [132]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it's balancing both, Erika, which is why, in response to the earlier question, we said we've been conservative on the timeline, because we want to reserve the flexibility to consider capital distributions when we do our CCAR in 2013, and it will be a factor we consider. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [133]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And a follow-up question on what you mentioned, Marianne, in the beginning of the call on Mortgage. You mentioned that if loan rates stay where they are, that could mean the market shrinks by 30% or 40%. What is the proportionate expense in that scenario that you could take out of the business, and how long typically is the lag until you can take those expenses out? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [134]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So Erika, the truly truly variable, as in transaction variable proportion of the business, is some.  But the majority of it is related to people and systems, so there's usually a several month lag to be able to get that out of the system. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And proportionately, if the revenues are down, let's say, origination revenues are down 30% to 40%, what's the efficiency ratio that we can think about as we think about the variable costs that can get taken out? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think, think about it this way. I think that revenue margins will be down on competitive pressures, volumes are down, and expenses may go up because volumes are down, for a couple of quarters. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [137]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I see. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [138]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sorry, expense margins would up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [139]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In other words, a dramatic reduction in profits. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [140]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're trying to be clear with you that this would be a significant event, if rates stay where they are, if mortgage rates stay where they are, or go higher. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Penala,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [141]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Thanks.

    Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt of Evercore Partners. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, guys. Want to ask, maybe I missed it, on expenses. Can you talk about how you're still feeling about the full-year target?  You previously had talked about down $1 billion year over year, ex-legal. Does that still stand? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so let me just walk you through it. So this quarter, our expenses adjusted for litigation were $15.2 billion.  For the first half, adjusted for corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters, it was $30.7 billion, which would be against the $59 billion target, which is running a little high.  But there are two important factors. One is in our definition of adjustment, we only adjusted out corporate litigation, so there's other litigation in the firm that's several hundred million dollars.  It's disclosed in our supplement.  You can see that.  And also in the first half of the year, we did see out performance in terms of the Investment Bank, or CIB, revenues.  And clearly, we pay compensation on that, which is a it good expense and we would waive it in all day long.  So if you take the combination of those two things that we don't technically adjust out, our underlying core expenses are on track for that number, yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. That's helpful.  And the additional litigation costs this quarter, somewhat elevated. How do we think about them going forward, staying elevated but similar rate, or a little bit lower, or how do we think about that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [146]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You can't really think about a run rate trend in litigation costs, because they are somewhat lumpy.  So we don't have a forecast for you, and they will go up and down. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [147]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it.  Thanks.  And then in terms of the rates, obviously, impact a lot of different businesses, Mortgage, the balance sheet, NII, NIM discussion, but then also can you walk through how we should think about it in terms of the FIC business, heightened volatility, maybe more volume, but then obviously softer environment in June.  How do we think about this current environment playing out for the back half of this year in terms of trading? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You're absolutely right. When you separate NIM, you try to tease it out and you make our interest rates.  Because you've got to look at the underlying results, underlying volumes and things like that. There's no reason to think that we aren't going to have a good trading going forward, because if the economy is strengthening, and we believe, our view is that it is, and that capital markets are going to open up again, and people get adjusted to slightly new, higher rates.  And yes, volatility helps certain trading areas. Higher interest rates hurt mortgages, but again, they can help other areas.  So it's a whole potpourri.  It's impossible almost to separate it out.  And we try to do that for you, but I think it's a little bit of a mistake when you look at the Hold Company. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.  And then my last question was just a clarification on there's been a lot of regulatory issues, capital, liquidity, buffers on buffers, OLA, et cetera. As well as I know you guys, I expect -- I think it's this quarter that you're resubmitting your CCAR plan. Is it fair to assume that despite all these things that have been coming out and there's still some hurdles that need to be met, that one shouldn't expect a change in capital deployment or should we? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [150]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So we are working really hard on the CCAR resubmission.  And you're right, we're going to resubmit that before the end of the third quarter. We're in constant dialogue with the regulators, although we won't receive any formal feedback until we're in the fourth quarter.  And so we're doing everything we can to be able to be successful in remediating any of the issues they identify for us.  And if we're able to do that, then there should be no impact. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [151]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It won't be for lack of trying. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [152]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it will not be for the number of people who are -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [153]

    You have probably a thousand people now who are devoted-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [154]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We have 500 people that are dedicated and thousands of people working on it.

    Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [157]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First of all, Marianne, you mentioned servicing costs in the mortgage business being down by about $600 million in the fourth quarter. Is that largely coming out of the default side of things or is that -- do you think that will be more evenly spread between default and regular, more regular servicing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So just a point of clarification, if it wasn't clear, is that our guidance is that we're expecting to get our expenses down to $600 million in the fourth quarter from the level they're at now, which is $715 million for this quarter.  So just to be very clear.  And to remind you, our longer term run rate for that business is $325 million a quarter.  So it is dominated by the default side, but there is some core performance obviously in there, too. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [159]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And to keep it really simple, we hope to get it to a run rate of $500 million the year after that, $400 million the year after that, and $325 million the year after, where we should be.  And we have a lot of work to do in systems, et cetera to get all that done.  And obviously the costly foreclosure, the legal stuff, is also coming down. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [160]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's about a three- to four-year run rate to get down to ultimately where you want to be? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [161]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Three-year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [162]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Three years.  And know that we're actively working the portfolio to be able to do what we can more quickly, so you would expect that we're looking at either sales or sub servicing of defaulted loans and capacatizing our performing servicing.  So we're working on all of that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [163]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Marianne, just a further clarification question. On gain on sale margins, you mentioned those were 118 basis points this quarter.  You mentioned last quarter that they were 100 basis points, and about 180 basis points on a normalized basis in the fourth quarter. Are all those calculated in the same way? Are those quarterly averages, or are those the gains at the end of the quarter?  Just wanted to be sure we understand that.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [164]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure.  They're all calculated the same way, based upon the disclosed closed loan volumes that we have to use.  So if you take the revenues and expenses and use the closed loans volumes for the quarter, that's how we derive the margins, which is why you see some short-term noise quarter over quarter and the increase this quarter to actually 116 basis points, because we actually book revenues when we lock loans, but we report them closed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [165]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Which is different than you guys do it at Wells. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [166]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. And then one final question.  Marianne, you mentioned deal activity appears to be turning, I think that was with respect to the commercial banking business. Could you provide a little more color on that?  Did June's volatility in the interest rate scenario slow down business activity in the commercial banking business?  And I'm not really specifically talking about the Investment Bank, but more in the commercial banking side of things. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  So I would tell you that it's more of what we're seeing and feeling in discussions and activity with our clients, that we feel like deal activity levels have picked up and may be turning.  And the pipeline feels a little better and solid, but not strong.  So we're expecting that to translate into the second half.  And obviously, as the economy continues to recover and confidence continues to grow, hopefully that will get even better. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And just finally, there's been a lot of talk, obviously, in the last couple of days about a potential reassertion of Glass Steagall.  And I guess I'm curious, given your current business model, would that, if that were to come to pass, would that be a meaningful negative in terms of your ability to maintain your cross-sell opportunities across the businesses, or is that perhaps less of a challenge given how you currently have the businesses structured? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [169]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I mean, listen, my comment on that is that Glass Steagall didn't have anything to do with the crisis, and our business model allowed us to be a port in the storm. Our customers like doing business with us in the model that we have now, so --  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [170]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [171]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We don't spend time thinking about that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [172]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.

    Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [174]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to be clear, when you talk about on page 4 that you're going to hold your capital distributions flat, is that for all of 2014 relative to '13? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [175]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  So Gerard, just to be really clear, and you look at the title there, to be illustrative, we just, for the purposes of this analysis, we just hold everything flat. That's not to imply anything about what our capital distributions will be going forward, but rather to imply we can continue to do some. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [176]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, okay.  And then second, you put in here the Tier 1 capital actions could add possibly 30 basis points. Could you give some color behind what you're thinking there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [177]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I mean it's just optimizing our mix between common and preferreds. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [178]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And would the total leverage impact of 60 to 160 basis points, clearly that's over the 5%, I assume then that you're going to be comfortable running something north of 5% when you finally get there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [179]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's too early for us to talk about passes on that level. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [180]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  In your Investor Day, you gave us the ROEs for the different lines of businesses.  And in the total firm, you felt 15% to16% was your target ROE. Will that change now that you've got to carry the higher leverage numbers? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [181]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think, folks, this just came out.  So we're trying to share information with you.  And it might, but give us a little bit of time and we'll give you a deeper feel how it might affect -- how this might affect different businesses, different products.  Because obviously when you do something like this, this will be pushed down, at one point, not just to the line of business, but to the client and the product and the country, and then we can answer that question for you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [182]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  You guys have had some great C&I loan growth in the middle market space over the last four, five, six quarters. It seemed to really slow down this quarter. Anything in particular happen? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [183]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Nothing in particular, just demand.  And I should temper that with, just demand and the continuation that we've talked about of very, very strong competition.  And we are, as I said, we are prioritizing quality over growth. We would tactically under perform rather than chase a deal that we weren't comfortable with. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [184]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And finally, can you give us any color on how the shared national credit exam has gone, and are those results in your second quarter results or will they be in third quarter results? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [185]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The results are in our second quarter results. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [186]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not that material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research - Analyst    [189]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups.  I hate to focus on the leverage ratio, but just one question on the cash component. I think, by my calculation, if you were to exclude cash from the denominator, that would add almost 70 basis points to your leverage ratio. Do you think that that has any legs or any sticking with regulators, in terms of logic around excluding that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [190]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You should probably ask them.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research - Analyst    [191]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [192]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We hope so. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research - Analyst    [193]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  It would make some sense.  And maybe just getting to the FIC business, you alluded to it a little bit, some businesses benefit from volatility. Is it fair to assume that in June we saw things like foreign exchange and interest rate trading do better and credit and mortgages do worse, is that sort of the best way to think about it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [194]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're not going to give you monthly specific.  I think our folks did a very good job in June. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research - Analyst    [195]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [196]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Obviously, when spreads widen out, certain businesses are more of this than others.  I already mentioned that Emerging Markets replies to the most volatility, both in terms of spreads volatility and equity markets, did a very good job. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Mitchell,  Buckingham Research - Analyst    [197]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR Capital Markets - Analyst    [199]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  Thank you very much. On your reserve ratios, right around 2%, and you had a lot of reserve releases in the quarter.  With credit improving, can you continue to do this type of releases in the next couple quarters or is that reserve ratio going to stick around 2%? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [200]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So you should think about mortgage as having some more releases, because we continue to see delinquencies and severities improve, particularly HPI improvement.  And so you should expect that to continue, maybe not at the level that we saw this quarter, because we had a big revision to HPI, as you know, during the last several months.  And in part, we've had $1.050 billion of reserve releases in the first half.  Given what we're seeing, we expect more releases in the second half, but not at that level. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [201]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Think of the several hundred million. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [202]

    Several hundred million dollars.

    Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous Research. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [207]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello, Guy. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [208]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. So just looking at the hit to the OCI at $3.1 billion, it actually seems like it's less than would have been implied by the guidance that you gave at the Investor Day. Obviously, that was for a more severe shock, but just calibrating it relative to the number of basis points that the 10-year went up, et cetera.   Any comment on that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [209]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You got it exactly right. At Investor Day, we gave you something that was far more dramatic than 100 basis points, and we already said the duration of this thing is not 10 years, it's a lot less than 10 years.  So obviously, the effect will be less. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [210]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And is part of the reason why, besides the fact that it was 100 basis point not a 230 basis point move or whatever, is part of the reason linked to the derisking of the Treasury portfolio that you were talking about as you prepared for the LCR? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [211]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not really. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [212]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not really. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [213]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  But then is there validity to the fact to the idea that if we recalibrate it for 100 basis points move versus the 230 basis points move that I think is implicit in that $15 billion number that you gave us in February, was the $3 billion in line with that or was it actually materially better?  And if so, maybe if it wasn't related to the LCR derisking, why did you have a better outcome? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [214]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So the Investor Day scenario was a more severe scenario than the 230 basis points you're implying.

Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [215]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What was the number we gave at Investor Day?  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [216]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It was 300 basis, plus or minus.  And this is in line with our expectations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [217]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Unfortunately, OCI is not, I hate to say, is not that big a deal. We all know about it. We're all prepared for it. Rates can go up. OCI gains are going to go down. 20 basis points, you're going to see this happen elsewhere. It's asynchronous. We have OCI going through capital and the benefits going through earnings in the future.  So if it were up to us, we wouldn't have actually had this asynchronous accounting to this thing.  And we're prepared, we're going to have buffers that could compare that.  We know how a conservation buffer works, but it's not that big a deal. The duration of our portfolio, and you guys can do it yourself, AA-plus, couple your duration, you could almost calculate the number yourself.  With one caveat is that the losses are less as rates go up, because of the complexity of the portfolio, currently.  And the other thing about this, we can change it overnight at any time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [218]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right.  Fair enough. As I think about the changes that you can make to the business that you referred to on page 4 to mitigate the impact of the leverage ratio changes, you talk about optimizing the use of central clearing, and yet there's also all these concerns about the disallowance of additional derivatives collateral. How comfortable are you that the way the rules are written right now, moving your derivatives business more towards central clearing really does, because of the collateral, give you a lot of relief on those leverage assets? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [219]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you move a trade to a central clearinghouse, it has no charge here and it has nothing to do with the margin that they put up with the clearinghouse. The trade is bilateral with us. You have the receivable get stressed, and you can't take the benefit of the fact that you're going to get collateral against it. That's the way the calculations are done.  So any trade you move to a clearing house eliminates that exposure. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [220]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right, so-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [221]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The margin of the clients with the clearing house is not with us. It's with the clearing house. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [222]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right.  So I guess the logical next question for that is given the central clearing mandate which has started to be implemented recently, should we, and as we think about leverage ratio going forward, should we be thinking about a large part of that derivatives add in to the denominator of the ratio as basically being in run-off? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [223]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We've already added in our forecast to you guys some moving derivatives, on liquid cap and all that.  I do think at the margins this will support things in the clearing houses.  But we don't have analysis to tell you about that right now. Will it be material? We don't really know yet. Remember, the clients, there's a lot of client business who, they are also going to determine what they want.  It won't be just up to us. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [224]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And remember that the derivative add-on calculation is a calculation that is currently being rethought by the Basel committee because of some of the issues with it.  So it could also, in and of itself,  improve. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [225]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. When you think about those leverage asset actions that you're talking about, is there any linkage of taking those actions that further benefits LCR? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [226]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We haven't done that analysis. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [227]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's hard to tell. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [228]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To be honest, we were trying to be very transparent and give you some ideas about the sorts of things that we're considering. We haven't translated these into detailed plans yet, so we don't know the second order impacts of this yet. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [229]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Fair enough. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [230]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think Marianne gave numbers to show that we can handle this.  But also, you have to be very cognizant of client effects. We have a client business, and we have to make sure that we continue to have a client franchise.  And so over time, we'll adjust the businesses, and we'll meet LCR, we'll meet Basel III, we're going to meet whatever the leverage ratio is.  And think of it in some ways of alternative minimum taxes.  So if every client will be running what's your return on Basel III capital and then what's your return on leverage capital?  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [231]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stress capital.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [232]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And stress capital.  So you'll try to manage all those as fair to the client and fair to the Company. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [233]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  One last question I'll ask you is that, as I've talked with clients over the last couple of days about this leverage ratio issue, one of the questions that has come up is wouldn't it be possible to downstream more capital to the bank sub in order to deal with the 6% requirement there?  Obviously,  that incurs a double leverage issue, potentially. Your double leverage ratio right now is just over, I think it's like 1.05. I mean is there any room there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [234]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Obviously, we can do stuff like that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [235]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [236]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Give us a little time. We're showing you that we can get to the consolidated pretty easily, maybe have to restructure some things and change the capital structure a little bit, and move businesses out of the FDIC-insured bank and all that. I just don't think any of that's going to be critical to the future function of our business. We'll adjust those things to accomplish what we need to accomplish. And give us a little more time.  It just happened a couple days ago. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonmous Research - Analyst    [237]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Of course, that's fair. Thank very much for taking my questions. I appreciate it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [238]

    Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [240]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, just following up on Guy. It seems the thrust of the whole leverage ratio is that it's going to penalize the businesses that have the highest ratio of leverage ratio assets to risk weighted assets.  And can you give us an idea where that gap is the biggest, and in particular, also are any of these global businesses where this would give European banks a leg up? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [241]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, let me take do the first question -- second question first. If you have a world where some businesses have to hold twice as much capital as other companies, that obviously over time can create huge competitive disadvantages. I don't know of any industry in America who would want to compete globally in that basis. We have an interest in a safe and sound system, so not against the leverage ratio.  But we would be, we're not for a hugely unbalanced competitive playing field.  So put that aside. The regulators know that.  They are trying to -- we thought part of Basel and all that is to harmonize these kind of things.  And if you ask about it, what we show here, and Marianne just shows, anything which is a low RWA asset, including HQLA, revolvers, certain types of derivatives, those things obviously you'll look at a little bit differently because it's a leverage ratio asset.  And we don't have to do it by business yet. We'll give you more detail later. 
Like even Marianne had mentioned that we take huge deposits in from countries and from money funds, et cetera, that you may not take in, because you can't afford capital against a deposit of $1  billion dollars you get from a money fund that you park with the Fed for 25 basis points, you pay the FDIC 10 basis points, you pay the client 5 or 6 or 7 basis points, you got to put 6% capital against it. You simply stop doing -- there are a whole bunch of things we've got to figure out how we're going to  do it.  But we want to make sure we manage the client franchise properly. We'll figure out the other stuff over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Kotowski,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [242]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All right.  That's it for me.  Thank you.

    Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [244]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great.  Jamie, following up on that, it just seems like even the $100 billion of increase in deposits this quarter probably cost you 15 basis points in that leverage ratio.  And so is there any movement, do you think, during the comment period towards exclusion of any of the risk -free assets at all? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [245]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So separate the type of deposit, okay? So if it's a consumer deposit, it has a completely different LCR, how you can invest, the kind of spread you can make. If it's what we call big wholesale short-term deposits, you're absolutely correct. We would probably restrict some of that over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [246]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. Okay.  And maybe just a follow-up on the mortgage business. You talked about some of the financial impacts. Can we talk a little bit just about strategically what you're doing as you look at that business, and the competitive environment in a weaker refi environment? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [247]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  This back up, although sharp, is not entirely unexpected.  So as we talk about our longer term plans, and when we outlined all of that and the strategy for the mortgage business at Investor Day,  that medium to long-term plan does not change.  So it may accelerate some of the activities that we have and have, as we said, some impact on the next couple of quarters' results.  But the long-term strategy hasn't changed. We're working the portfolio, optimizing servicing, trying to take costs out as quickly as possible and grow share.  And actually, we think we should be able to grow share even more strongly in a more difficult market. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [248]

    Our next question comes from Nancy Bush of NAB Research. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [250]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Two questions. First, on branch, on the branch banking network.  I know this back up in rates has been primarily at the longer end and we have not yet had a corresponding rise in short-term rates, but do you see any needs, at this point, to reprice products, et cetera, at the branch level due to consumer perception of rising rates? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [251]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No.  No, Nancy.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [252]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not yet.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [253]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not yet.  And as you know, traditionally that would, in any case, lag. Of course, that doesn't mean it will, but that's traditionally what happens. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [254]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Secondly, Jamie, you talked about the asynchronous nature of OCI, with OCI getting dinged now with the benefits of the future. Something else asynchronous is staring us in the face, and that's this loan loss reserve methodology possible change to expected lifetime loss. What are your thoughts about that? I mean, where does that stand in an implementation process, and would you really get dinged by that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [255]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is what the issue is with all this, you spend all your time talking about accounting, as opposed to business. The business is deposits, serving clients, doing things.  And now we talk all the time about AOCI.  And we have a lot of asynchronous accounting, and pro cyclical accounting and stuff like that, that we try to explain.  But we try to look through all of that and build a business, more clients, more bankers, more branches, happier clients.  So in all of our business, that's how we look at it. We'll work through the asynchronous accounting.  If the loan loss reserve accounting changes, it would add, obviously the loan losses, though probably not as much as people think.  But we still would run the business for economics in the long run. It wouldn't change how we run the business. We would be just be holding more reserves, which would be fine with us. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [256]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, do you have any sense, I mean, I realize that you're going to run the business for the business, but do you have any sense if this is going to happen and when it might happen? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [257]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, as you know, the industry commented, we commented in terms of the proposal.  And we are generally in favor of it, but I think that a lifetime timeline is too long, so something shorter than that would make sense.  I think we need to work that through.  It would be implemented over, not the course of the next couple of quarters, but in a year or so.  So we'll wait and see. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nancy Bush,  NAB Research - Analyst    [258]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All right.  Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [259]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Chris Whelan of Carrington. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Whelan,  Carrington Investment - Analyst    [260]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marianne, could you go back to Mortgage and talk a little bit about the quality of the demand you're seeing? At the beginning of the year, the industry was guiding down about 20% in terms of volumes and for next year, as well. Your numbers suggest that that's basically doubled; in other words, instead of 20%, we're looking at 30% to 40%, given rates. Would it be fair to say that the two factors are equal? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [261]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would say, so first of all, the industry groups haven't fully reforecast the market, so we'll wait and see what they come out with.  We're trying to be transparent with our guidance, so that level, hopefully we're wrong and hopefully it will be better than that. I will say, for our own business, we didn't expect volumes to be down this much throughout the year, had this not happened with this space. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Whelan,  Carrington Investment - Analyst    [262]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So you think there is definitely a price reaction out there among consumers? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [263]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, mostly this is refi. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Whelan,  Carrington Investment - Analyst    [264]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. Exactly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [265]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So purchase, we actually saw go up a little bit. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Whelan,  Carrington Investment - Analyst    [266]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But purchase isn't catching up, though. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [267]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    They're not going to make up for refi.  But they may go up, yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Whelan,  Carrington Investment - Analyst    [268]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But Jamie, back to your point about harmonization, when you look at the totality of the way regulators are treating mortgage, MSRs, for example, which have been rallying very strongly in the past few months, and your comments last year about Basel.  Should the US withdraw from Basel II?  It's so unfriendly to businesses that are very important to you and to the economy, particularly in Mortgage. What are your thoughts on that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [269]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Look, we're in favor of finishing.  We've always believed in high capital, high liquidity, good regulation and things like that, and finishing it.  And obviously, there are things that all countries have points of view about which would be different.  But I think the better you get to real harmonization -- the closer you get to real harmonization, the better. If you want to start all over again, we'll spend another five years debating every single thing out there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Whelan,  Carrington Investment - Analyst    [270]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  Precisely. Thank you very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [271]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

    Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [273]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks very much. Marianne, can we just go back to the sequential NII guidance? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [274]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [275]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you help me understand how much of that is coming, or what the attribution is between benefits to NIM versus loan growth? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [276]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, as I said, we're expecting NIMs to stay broadly flat from here. We do expect some modest loan growth, that's our outlook. I'm not going to tell you how much, but some.  And then we also have the improving cost of debt,  lower cost of debt on actions that we've been taking throughout the first half. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [277]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I guess a couple of thoughts then. Shouldn't, presumably then, the benefits to the funding costs should show up through NIM, no? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [278]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. But we also have the yield compression.  So you know, there's puts and takes.  And so relatively flat on NIM, modestly up on NII. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [279]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And just within the composition of loan growth, if you divorce out the credit card seasonality, it's been within a very stable range. What is it that, in your view, takes the loans out of the current range? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [280]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'm sorry, I didn't understand. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [281]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So in other words, your loan growth has been -- sorry, not your growth, but rather your loan balances have been between $725 billion and $727 billion or $728 billion very consistently for many quarters, if you divorce out fourth quarter credit card seasonality.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [282]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [283]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But it sounds like you have some expectation that starts to move out of that range in order to generate this improvement in NII?  I'm wondering what the driver of that is. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [284]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're growing loans in Asset Management.  We're growing loans in Auto.  We're adding more mortgage loans.  We're expecting some growth in Commercial. Our Commercial Real Estate is already growing strongly. We're expecting some growth in middle market and Corporate Client Banking space.  Although we've seen loan reduction in CIB, we're expecting that to remain relatively flat.  So all other things being equal, that's net growth. And Card, as I said, have hit that inflection point, so that will stop contributing to run-off, net. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [285]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it.  And then just finally, on the third quarter guidance, is that consistent with or relatively better than your prior annual guidance of down 1%? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [286]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So our annual guidance was that, if you look at the first half of the year, you'll see that obviously already we're down year-to-date by more than that amount.  So this is relative to the third quarter, we expect NII to go up.  We're already down a little more than 1%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great. Thanks very much.

    Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Wheeler,  Mediobanca - Analyst    [289]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  Good morning. I have questions on a couple of topics.  Perhaps the first one, on Equity Capital Markets. Clearly, I think the volumes were up about 2% quarter-on-quarter, and I think we all expected you to outperform.  But it was an extremely good performance.  And I wondered if you could brag a little bit about how you achieved that and how much you thought was from the market share and perhaps how much is down to geographic split. That's the first question. 
The second one, I'm afraid, I'll get back on to leverage. I'm intrigued by the comments on page 4, which you've touched on in an earlier question on the Tier 1 capital actions, which you suggested would be perhaps issuance of some additional Tier 1 capital,  as it's becoming now called, AT1.  And I wondered if you actually had any indication yet, I know it's fairly early, from the regulator on what the terms of that new capital would have to be to qualify for Tier 1 under Basel III?  And then perhaps talk about the $14 billion to $15 billion of current hybrids that you have within the Tier 1 calculation, which obviously you're going to phase out, I think in some cases, if not all, through to end of 2018, and what your strategy is for the placing those.  
And just perhaps finally, I know Jamie's talked a lot about level playing field, and I asked him that last year on Basel III capital, but I'm just wondering actually the leverage ratio that you're looking to have to achieve now, whether it actually gives you a competitive advantage as opposed to a disadvantage, given 3% is pretty well being considered too skinny. Thanks very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [290]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, thank you for bragging on our trading results.  And for years, the Investment Bank is building FX rates, securitized products, commodities, emerging markets, credit.  And they're good. And obviously, some go up and some go down.  I wouldn't say it was-- at least, I didn't see any regional effects. We trade around the world and the books get handed off around the world, so it's hard to give it a region.  But we build a lot of clients low businesses and that what's driving it.  
I think it's better for the world to have harmonized rules around what Basel is trying to do, et cetera. But you're absolutely correct. It doesn't have to be exactly the same to have a competitive marketplace, et cetera. We always ran with higher capital liquidity than most of our competitors.  I just think if one is 3% and one is 6%, that becomes just too big, and over time it could have huge competitive effects.  And the regulators are working it out.  We all want a fair, safe, sound financial system, okay? So that's in everyone's benefit, and there are huge capital issues -- capital requirements, liquidity requirements, leverage requirements, stress testing requirements.  And among all of that, I feel that we're getting there.  But at one point, this should be somewhat harmonized.  
And your middle two questions, I now forgot. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [291]

    Okay.

Operator    [294]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from David Hilder of Drexel Hamilton. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Hilder,  Drexel Hamilton - Analyst    [295]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.  Just quickly.  To be clear, on page 4, are you saying that your 4.7% leverage ratio is as of June 30 without any other assumptions or roll forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [296]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, correct. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Hilder,  Drexel Hamilton - Analyst    [297]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  And then secondly-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [298]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'm sorry, David.  As of June 30, based upon the US proposed rules. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [299]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Estimated to the best of our ability. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Hilder,  Drexel Hamilton - Analyst    [300]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And congratulations for doing the work so quickly.  But secondly, Jamie, how will you as a company respond to the proposal? Are you in favor of it largely? Are you against it? Will you have a lot of proposed changes to it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [301]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So, David, we did say at the beginning that we do think that having a leverage ratio is an important part of our capital management toolkit or process, as long as it's properly calibrated.  And so for us the two questions, I think they are very important and the industry does, too.  So we're participating in discussions.  As Jamie's talked about, what should the quotient, or the ratio, be and making sure that that not only is appropriate but fair across the globe, and also what should the calculation for the denominator be.  And we've alluded already to two specific questions, but there are more. 
One is should high quality liquid assets, most particularly cash and cash at central banks, be treated the same as other balance sheet items?  And then in terms of some of the additional add-ons that are being proposed, we think they could have issues, actual issues, for the operation of the financing market.  So I think there's going to be a lot of work that takes place. There are comments due back on all of those proposals by mid-September, call it, plus or minus.  And I think this will be worked through through the fourth quarter.

David Hilder,  Drexel Hamilton - Analyst    [302]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Thanks very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [303]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And we have no further questions at this time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [304]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman & CEO    [305]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.
