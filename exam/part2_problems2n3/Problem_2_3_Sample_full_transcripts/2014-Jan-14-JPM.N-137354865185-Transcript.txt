Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth-quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded.
Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake.
Ms. Lake, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
So we start on Page 1. The Firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.30 a share with a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenues of $24 billion, down 1% year-on-year, and up 1% quarter-on-quarter.
As you see, we had several significant items in the quarter, which I will review as we go through the presentation in more detail, but they include a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of Visa shares, and a $0.5 billion gain on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, both in the corporate segment; as well as a $0.8 billion pretax or a $1.1 billion after-tax impact of legal expense in the quarter, partly booked in mortgage with the remainder that's in corporate, principally the Madoff settlement recently announced; a $1.3 billion benefit from reduced loan loss reserves in consumer businesses. And then in addition, CIB's results for the quarter include a $2 billion loss for DVA and FVA, or funding valuation adjustments, which I'll also come back to in more detail. The total impact of these items is a negative $0.10 of EPS.
So not to diminish their importance but to illustrate the strength of the core performance of the underlying businesses, if you do adjust our results for these items we would have earned $5.7 billion of net income, $1.40 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%.
So talking about the full year, skipping over Page 2 and straight to Page 3, reported net income of nearly $18 billion or $4.35 a share on revenue of approximately $100 billion, and a return on tangible common equity reported of 11%. Again if you adjust it for all reported significant items in the year we would have earned net income of over $23 billion, $5.70 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%. Again, strong underlying performance for the full year.
Of note, let me talk for a minute about adjusted expenses. You can see on the page that our adjusted expenses, that's excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure related matters, are a flat $60 billion. This is in line, albeit at the high end of our guidance of $59.5 billion to $60 billion for the year, but included in this number is a total of close to $1 billion of other non-corporate legal expense, which if we had adjusted would have left a more core number at just over $59 billion, despite the incremental investment in controls of a $1 billion we made in the year.
So briefly recapping on 2013, clearly a year marked by regulated development and significant legal settlements; however, more importantly, also a year in which our businesses together and individually performed strongly. We succeeded in further progressing our customer satisfaction agenda and gaining market share across businesses. 2013 saw very strong credit performance across businesses, including significant improvements in mortgage, and finally we ended the year with strong capital liquidity and margins.
So let's talk about capital on Page 4. So I'm not going to talk much about Basel I, except to say that you can see we progressed our ratio in the quarter to 10.7% Basel I Tier 1 common, but importantly if you look at the middle section, you see that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is 9.5%, meeting our year-end target.
Just a few words on the component underlying this ratio. Three things. First, we generated approximately $5 billion of net capital in the quarter. Second, we also saw significant RWA benefits of model and parameter updates, including HPI and lower spreads, as well as portfolio run-off. And third, these positives together worth over 60 basis points of improvement were reduced by about 50 basis points due to higher levels of operational risk capital.
The significant increase in operation risk capital this quarter is largely driven by the inclusion of the large legal expense from the prior quarter, and we will spend some more time on capital at Investor Day, but despite headwinds we still anticipate reaching 10% plus or minus Basel III Tier 1 common by the end of this year.
So a quick update on leverage. Both the Firm-wide and the bank supplementary leverage ratio under US rules increased to 4.7%, and I'll come back on the next page to talk about the final Basel SLR framework that was issued this weekend. During the quarter, the Holding Company converted certain inter-Company debt at the bank into capital, improving the bank's relative ratios. We remain compliant with LCR at the Firm level this quarter, including the impact of the proposed new rules, and we continue to have about 19% available resources relative to risk-weighted assets at the end of the year.
So before we move on, as you know, the Volcker rule was finalized in the quarter and having had the opportunity to consider the rule, some thoughts. So the certainty provided by having a final rule and the implementation date of July 2015 were welcome.
It is a tough rule and the regulators have laid out stringent standards for compliance policies, procedures, controls, and testing, which will bring operational challenges to implement; however, we believe that the Firm will be materially compliant across our businesses with the rule. We have work to do to get there but we don't expect any material impact to our results.
So let's take a closer look at the impact of the final SLR framework from this weekend on Page 5. So as you saw, the Basel committee released the framework this weekend which has gone a long way towards closing the gap relative to the US NPR. And the changes they made are responsive to industry feedback and seem sensitive to potential market impacts.
Our initial analysis estimates that the impact will worsen both the Holding Company and bank ratios by only approximately 10 basis points relative to US proposed rules, so that would be 4.6% for each of the Holding Company and the bank. This impact is primarily driven by a positive related to improved assumptions on unfunded commitments, being slightly more than offset by the inclusion of written credit protection provisions previously not in the US rules.
However, between the likely implementation in the future of NIM for derivative potential for future exposure, and the ability over time for us to improve netting for cash collateral, there should be significant improvement opportunity to our ratios in tens of basis points. So overall, our leverage action plans don't change materially.
We'll be thoughtful and measured about implementation in 2014 and beyond, and our perspective on specific products and businesses is not just driven by capital implications but also by the importance to the broader franchise and client relationships. We do expect to reach 5% plus or minus at the Holding Company by the end of this year and to be compliant at the bank shortly thereafter. So the next step is for the US regulators to determine when and if they will adopt this new denominator, although we feel it's reasonably likely that they will.
In addition over the weekend there was a consultation paper issued on NSFR. The proposal more closely aligns NSFR to the current evolved LCR framework in terms of definitions and assumptions, which we see as a positive step, and based upon the proposal, we estimate that the Firm is compliant today with NSFR.
So turning to business performance, let's start with the Consumer and Community Banking on Page 6. The combined Consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue with a return on equity of 20%.
A couple of comments on drivers. We continue to make strong progress as I said on our customer satisfaction agenda, being recognized by the American Consumer Satisfaction Index, ACSI, for the second year running, as number one among largest banks, as well as number one in small business in three of four regions in the US, and number one among large banks for mortgage originations both by JD Power.
On our Retail branch network, we've completed building out our key expansion markets, including California and Florida, and have reached leadership positions in each of our key markets. So we feel good about our footprints, at or around this level of 5,600 branches plus or minus, and our focus from here is on optimization including branch size and usage and leveraging digital capabilities.
Lastly, our other key business drivers continue to grow strongly, reflecting increased consumer engagement evidenced by growth in deposits, investments, sales, and processing volumes. And our expenses, which are down nearly $700 million from last year, primarily due to lower mortgage banking expenses. And across CCB, we've reduced headcounts by 16,500 year over year.
Turning to Page 7, Consumer and Community Banking generated net income of $780 million and an ROE of 28% on net revenue of $4.4 billion, up 4% and flat to the prior quarter. Net interest income is up 3% year-on-year, driven by the continued strong growth in deposits, partially offset by spread compression. And it's our investments in customer satisfaction, new builds, and CPC that's driving deposit growth, and also the highest account retention rates in a decade.
On the non-interest revenue side we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue, with close to $190 billion of client investment assets, up 19% or $30 billion year over year, about half related to market performance and half due to net new money gains. Expenses are up 3% year-on-year, reflecting cost relating to the strengthening of the control environments, but have flattened sequentially as we improve efficiency in our same-store branches with starting down by over 6,000 year over year.
Business banking loan balances are flat quarter-on-quarter and up 1% year-on-year, and production levels in the pipeline remain stable; however the environment has been challenging throughout the year due to competitive pressures, and we've maintained a high level of credit discipline. But we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see small businesses start to spend some of their cash reserves in 2014 but growth may be back-ended.
Turning to Page 8, Mortgage Banking. Overall, Mortgage Banking net income was $562 million with an ROE of 11%. There are a couple of non-recurring items this quarter which I'll explain as we go through the results, but if you look at the top of the page you see production ex-repurchases with a reported pretax loss of $500 million, but if you look at the table on the top right, we've adjusted for the one-time items and you can see a loss of $91 million, slightly negative as expected and as we guided to. Revenues in the quarter were down 15% on lower application volumes, down 23%, and from a mix perspective, nearly 60% of loans were purchase loans this quarter, up from a little over 20% at the same time last year.
Production expense includes approximately $400 million of non-MBS related legal expense. This is part of the significant item on the front page. Again, adjusting for this, we're seeing the benefits of actions we've taken to reduce expenses, with adjusted expenses coming down around $80 million quarter over quarter.
Dealing with repurchases, as you know, during the quarter we reached a settlement with the GSEs on agency repurchase exposure. After allowing for the settlement amount we are releasing a net $130 million of repurchase reserves this quarter, with $90 million being added to compensatory fee reserves, as the settlement did not cover these potential fees.
And before moving on to servicing, just looking out to the third quarter of 2014. The overall mortgage market is estimated to be roughly flat versus the fourth quarter, and although we do expect to see some continuation and expense improvements, revenues will continue to be challenged, and we're guiding for the first quarter similar to the last two quarters to be slightly negative in pretax deductions.
Moving to servicing, pretax income about breakeven in the quarter. Servicing expenses of $663 million includes that $90 million of compensatory fee expense that I just mentioned, which related to loans previously contemplated in the repurchase reserves. Adjusting for this item our core expenses would have been slightly better than our previous guidance of $600 million for the quarter.
Finally on Real Estate portfolio, pretax income of $1.2 billion including charge-offs of $167 million and a total reserve release of $950 million. The non-credit impaired reserve release for the quarter was $200 million, reflecting continued improvements in the portfolio but at a lower rate. But also we released $750 million of reserves in the purchase credit impaired portfolios, given recent significant improvements in HPI forecasts of approximately 5% for our portfolio through 2015.
Turning to Page 9, Card, Merchant Services, and Auto. Net income of $1 billion, up 23% year-on-year with an ROE of 26%, or 22% excluding reserve releases, reflecting underlying excellent performance in the business. Consumer spending has been increasing and we're seeing strong growth in interchange revenue, reflecting growth in sales volume as well as seasonality in the Fourth Quarter.
Year over year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was consistently strong at 11% and 14% respectively, with average outstanding flat year over year and quarter over quarter, yields remaining healthy but lower than a year ago. We do continue to see run-off of high rate and low FICO balances, with a move towards more engaged customers or transactors, which is a positive trend for spend and for credit performance but a negative for yield and we expect spread compression to continue into 2014.
Net, this drove revenues of $4.7 billion, down 3% year over year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter on seasonality with a revenue rate of 12.34% for the quarter. Consistent with these portfolio trends, the net charge-off rate has stayed at historical lows at 2.85%, and we released $300 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, given improved delinquencies and portfolio seasoning. Expenses are up 3% year-on-year but 16% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by increased marketing investment spend and costs associated with payments to customers required by consent order.
A few words on Auto. Originations up 16% year-on-year, driving loan balances up 5% year-on-year and outpacing new car sales growth of 5%.
And before we move on, as you know, there were two security -- data security breaches affecting our customers over the last several weeks. We took quick action to protect our customers and we continue to monitor both situations. The financial impact for the quarter is not significant.
Moving on to Slide 10 and the Corporate Investment Bank. The CIB results this quarter include a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing the FVA, or funding valuation framework, as well as a $0.5 billion DVA loss. On this page we'll focus on the numbers excluding FVA and DVA in the table on the top right, and then I'll come look back to FVA on the next page.
So we have net income of $2.1 billion on revenues of $8 billion and an ROE of 15%, and we maintained our number one ranking in both global IB fees and markets revenue, gaining share year over year of over 100 basis points in each. In banking, total revenue of $3 billion with IB fees slightly ahead of our guidance.
IB fees of $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% quarter-on-quarter and down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower debt underwriting compared with a record prior-year quarter, partially offset by strength in equity underwriting. Treasury services revenues of $1 billion down 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by decision to reposition our trade loan portfolio.
Moving on to Markets and Investor Services, our Markets revenue of $4.1 billion was flat year-on-year, also slightly ahead of the guidance we provided in the fourth quarter. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.2 billion flat year-on-year with continued solid client flows, and Equity Markets of $873 million, down quarter-on-quarter off of a very strong equity derivative results last quarter as well as seasonality. Security Services revenue of $1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services revenue on record Assets Under Custody of $20.5 trillion and also on higher deposits.
Just a comment on credit. We continue to see a favorable credit environment with stable credit quality trends, and our provisions continue to benefit from repayments and recoveries. Expenses of $4.9 billion, down 2% both year over year and quarter over quarter, driven by lower compensation. The comp to revenue ratio excluding FVA and DVA was 27% for the quarter, in line with the same quarter last year, and 30% for the full year, which is in line with our guidance albeit at the lower end on higher capital year over year.
Loan balances are down 7% year-on-year, flat quarter-on-quarter, again primarily driven by trade loan balances which could trend down or continue to trend down as we optimize the portfolio. And at the bottom of the driver section, VaR remains low at $42 million for the quarter.
So turning to Page 11 and coming back to the FVA adjustments. We are recording a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation, or an FVA framework for our OTC derivatives and structured notes this quarter, reflecting an industry migration towards incorporating the lifetime cost or benefit of unsecured funding into valuations.
Just a couple of minutes on the background and dealing with -- why now? To date there has been no broad consensus that funding should be explicitly incorporated into valuation estimates; however, we believe that market practice for pricing and valuing derivatives has noticeably evolved during 2013 as we've been actively and continuously evaluating the market.
We've now accumulated compelling evidence, both from transactions as well as industry pricing services, that dealers are pricing funding into uncollateralized derivatives with a degree of consistency. This supports incorporating an FVA framework this quarter.
In very simple terms, you can think of FVA which represents a funding spread over LIBOR as having the effect of present valuing market funding costs into the value of derivative receivables today. These funding costs otherwise would have affected net income over the life of the derivatives.
Although the FVA framework applies to both assets and liabilities, the adjustment in the quarter is largely related to uncollateralized derivative receivables for two reasons. First, the funding value of collateral is already incorporated in the valuation of collateralized derivatives. And second, credit spreads, which are a significant component of funding spreads, are already recorded on liabilities through DVA.
So in thinking about the size of the adjustments, you have to consider the size, the tenor, the composition of the relevant portfolio, as well as the appropriate spread. So to give you some context, if you start with derivative receivables net of cash and securities collateral of approximately $50 billion, apply an average duration of approximately five years, and a spread of approximately 50 basis points, that accounts for about $1 billion plus or minus the adjustment. Additionally, although there is a material overlap between DVA and FVA, the remaining difference contributes to the adjustments.
So the loss in the quarter represents a transition adjustment to this new framework and can be thought of as a one-time event as we incorporate the concept into the portfolio value. Going forward, FVA will be incorporated into day-one valuation of derivatives, and implementing FVA should have the effect of significantly reducing our sensitivity to funding spreads going forward. We'll continue to refine FVA as the framework matures within the industry.
So moving on to Page 12, the Commercial Bank saw a net income of nearly $700 million this quarter on revenue of $1.8 billion with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were up 6% per year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter. Net interest income increasing by 5% year over year, reflecting a one-time gain of approximately $100 million related to a lending related work out.
Pricing spreads have continued to tighten across the board. Non-interest revenues were 8% up year-on-year, driven by record growth IB fees of over $500 million for the quarter. Our credit book continues to show very strong performance with net charge-off rates of only 7 basis points as we continue to focus on quality names and are comfortable passing on deals that don't meet our standards.
Expenses were up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect higher product and headcount related expenses, primarily in controls. Loan balances were up 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter.
Our commercial Real Estate businesses continue to outperform the industry, up 15% year-on-year, 16 consecutive months of growth. But in C&I, overall loan growth remains flat, performing slightly below the industry as client demand continues to be low, competition high, and we remain focused on credit discipline over growth.
While sentiment remains fragile there are pockets of activity and we are cautiously optimistic that borrowing demand may improve as confidence in the recovery spreads, but again that may be back-ended in the year as clients are very liquid. Finally, deposits are up 3% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter on seasonality.
Page 13 and Asset Management. Continued strong investment performance and long-term inflows drove a fourth consecutive year of record revenue. The quarter saw a net income of $568 million, up 18% year-on-year with an ROE of 25%.
Record revenues of $3.2 billion, up 15% year-on-year are driven by three main factors. Strong fund performance as well as long term flows in every single asset class and from every region. Overall, benefiting from higher markets. And finally, a mark-to-market gain from a seed capital investment.
This is the 19th consecutive quarter of long term inflows, with $16 billion for the quarter, bringing the full year to a total $90 billion, driving record Assets Under Management of $1.6 trillion, up 12%. We saw particular strength in multi-asset and equities and achieved number one ranking in 2013 for net flows in active long-term mutual funds. Expenses increased in line with performance of the business. And finally, in banking we continued to see growth across the board with record loan balances over $95 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Page 14, a total net income of nearly $800 million for corporate and private equity for the quarter. In private equity, a relatively quiet quarter with aggregate results more modest than in prior quarters.
Treasury CIO showed a net loss of $78 million, driven by negative NII of nearly $100 million. But that compared to a run rate of negative NII of approximately $500 million in each of the first two quarters. This improvement reflects the benefit of higher investment security deals, up 50 basis points.
The investment securities portfolio has also been a significant contributor to firm-wide NIM stability. And in the second half of the year we deployed $66 billion gross in new investments, principally mortgages and munis.
Our ending balance of securities that classified as held to maturity grew to $24 billion and will continue to grow this quarter. And you should expect CIO Treasury NII to reach breakeven in the second half of 2014, all other things equal.
And before I continue just let me talk for a second about NIM and NII, details of which are in the appendix. Firm-wide NIM, core NIM, and NII were all up slightly quarter over quarter given market rates, and we expect both NIM and NII to be relatively stable in the near term, with the higher security deals I talked about being largely offset by loan spread compressions.
Finally on this page, other corporate, sees a net income of $852 million and has a call out on the page. First, a net gain, all of these are after-tax, first a net gain of $800 million on the sale of Visa shares. We were and we remain a large Visa shareholder; however in the quarter, we saw the opportunity to risk manage approximately one-third of our Visa price risk exposure, but we clearly retain the ongoing litigation risks, both the ultimate amount and timing of settlements.
Secondly, a net Real Estate gain of over $300 million on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and these two gains are being offset by nearly $800 million in legal expense, substantially all Madoff related. In addition, a few positive tax items in the quarter, largely the release of prior reserves.
So Page 15 and our outlook to wrap up. We've actually covered all of the items on this page. So wrapping up just to say that our four leading franchises are all performing very strongly and we remain focused on serving our clients. We're committed to accomplishing our control agenda and adjusting successfully to the new global financial architecture, and we look forward to diving deeper into all of these things at Investor Day which is coming up in a few weeks' time.
With that, thank you. And operator, you can open up the line to Q&A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, Guy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just wanted to talk about the leverage ratio for a moment, you talked about a 10 basis point increase from the latest on Basel, if they do the add-ons. And I guess the big part that's hardest for us to see is really the impact of the CDS non-netting of mismatched maturities on protection bought versus protection sold. Can you give us a sense of what your numbers look like on that basis so we can try and reconcile to your 10 basis points?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so just a quick thing just to clarify. The 10 basis points is actually lower, not higher, so it's a deduct, not an add for the new Basel proposal relative to the US rules. So remember as we've previously been disclosing our ratios, we used the US proposed rules that referenced a prior Basel denominator, so it's a 10 basis point worsening.
And you're right that we had two major things contributing to that. We had a positive associated with better assumptions on draws on unfunded commitments, slightly more than offset by a negative on the risk [credit] protection. So we're still working through the prior details but our best estimate is that it's in the mid 20s in basis points, 25 basis points plus or minus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. And can you give just give us a sense for what the maturity profile looks like on your CDS protection purchased versus sold? I mean is there much of a maturity mismatch there or is there really not much?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you start with our gross growth CDS protection written, it's about $3.4 trillion, and by the time you net down from maturities it gets down to a couple hundred billion, but that is still impactful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Another thing to think about, it will be manageable because really this is kind of a static analysis before we start running the business slightly differently due to it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We saw the proposals as having been thoughtful and we don't necessarily have to agree with the finer points of all of them, but it doesn't materially change our position or our thoughts going forward. And as Jamie said, all of our businesses will now socialize and optimize against what we understand to be the final rules when the US regulators adopt them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. That's helpful, thanks. On the $60 billion of core expense that you pointed out on balance having been pretty flat with last year despite the increases in control environment cost, can you give us a sense of how you currently see that evolving in 2014?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so, Guy, we're obviously going to do a bit more of a detailed deep dive on expenses over time on Investor Day. So for now what we have said is that you should expect our adjusted expenses for 2014 to remain at or below that level of $60 billion. We also said that in 2014, the continuation of our control agenda is adding an incremental $1 billion over 2013, so by remaining flat we're effectively self-funding that $1 billion. That's down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. And how do you get comfortable that by doing that, you're not going to eat into revenue growth, by pardon the use of the word, but by starving other expenses?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We're not starving any expenses. We're just managing it in a disciplined way the way we've always done it and you look at the underlying numbers there's a lot of growth in the underlying numbers, but it's clearly true that some of the derisking and selling, spinoff OEP, and physical commodities will affect revenues a little bit, but obviously profits less.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And, Guy, we've always been investing in the businesses and been willing to invest where the business takes and the returns justify that, but we are also finding efficiencies in the combination of the businesses, both consumer and the wholesale businesses, efficiency in the same store, branches we talked about, CIB continues on its journey on the back office and front office integration, and obviously mortgage expenses will continue to trend down both in line with improved credit trends and also as we proactively manage the portfolio. So there's a lot of moving parts but it's not at the expense of our willingness to invest in the businesses for returns.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And just if I could follow-up on the mortgage expense comment that you made, more just along the lines of the expense that's against the origination franchise. It sounded to me like you may be extending your view of what the time frame is to kind of get that to steady state beyond the first quarter, is that right or am I misreading that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's not just about expenses. You have to think about the whole equation. If you look at a mortgage market we'll see some improvement in the first quarter 2014, and we'll also continue to work on expense efficiency in the business. But if you look at a market which is currently being estimated about $1.3 trillion, down from $1.9 trillion, and honestly a couple weeks ago it was $1.1 trillion, so it's a very small market, one we haven't seen the likes of since year 2000, in a market like that it's very challenging to deliver through the cycle returns.
So we went through over the last few years, years with very strong revenues and margins, and we are in a challenging environment as we look into 2014 but we're working on it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. And the last one for me just you mentioned the impact of operating risk due to the very high level of litigation costs this year. How should we think about that and how are you thinking about that with respect to CCAR?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, so the way to think about it in the short-term relative to say the submission that we just did or in the near future is that obviously, a realized loss experience that is higher than we have previously seen informs your view and judgment as to what you could reasonably expect to happen in a future stress period. So it is fair to say that that would drive our expectations (inaudible) on operational losses to be slightly higher. Having said that, it's not as if our previous submissions didn't contemplate there to be significant stresses in operating losses, so I would characterize it as incremental and certainly not from a low base.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, great. Thanks very much for answering my questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And also, Guy, sorry, just remember that every quarter we move forward we generate capital, improve our ratios, so there's lots of moving parts to the ultimate outcome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guy Moszkowski,  Autonomous - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. Thanks.

    Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, Betsy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marianne, I just wanted to follow-up on a couple things. One was on NIM outlook. You did indicate that in the second half of 2014 you were expecting that the CIO and Treasury income would turn positive if I read it correctly, and I would think that it's a function of your security yields improving. Can you just give us a sense of what the net new investment yield is for the security investments that you're making in that book right now relative to what it's at? The balances are at?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think the way you should look at it is something like $40 billion gets reinvested in a year. The basic assumption you should make is it's an average duration of three or four years, so think of a five-year bonds or something like that, and just use the implied yield curve. Obviously (inaudible) munis or MBS or something like that, but I need to point out that it's completely dependent upon the decisions we make, so we can change that kind of at will if we want to extend or reduce the duration of equity of the Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right. And so given your comments that you're expected to reach breakeven by the second half of 2014, that's a reflection of higher interest rates or a change in the way you're investing the funds?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's both.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's a little bit of both. It's mostly just the change in the yield curve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We have slower mortgage fee payments, we're able to reinvest at higher yields, we're reinvesting in high quality assets, munis with high spreads, so it's both.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then your other point was you're going to be taking that better return on that portfolio and using it to be as competitive as you want to be on the loan portfolio, and so expectation is that loan spreads continue to pull-down over the next couple of quarters at least. Can you just give us a sense as to how willing you are to be competitive on price and loan spreads? Should we be expecting that overall NIM compression is what you're looking for here in the event that you get the quality of loan growth you want?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well you have got to separate the loans. On the commercial side we'll obviously be competitive and we're not assuming anything heroic in terms of rate spreads getting worse or better but they're low. You could argue down the road they might actually go up a little bit as capital requirements and liquidity requirements go way up, so but we'll be competitive. We're assuming you have to be competitive in loan spreads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And on the consumer side, card balances have been rewritten post-crisis to be variable. Are you anticipating that you're going to be in a rising rate environment in the belly of the curve raising rates on card portfolio?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Think of the card business, we try to run it fully match funded so the spreads are about the same, and somewhere like 65% is at an interest rate something like 40% is transactor almost locked in rates, so which we also match fund.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then separate topic just on the security breach that you discussed and you indicated that the card replacements that you've done so far has been de minimis in terms of expense, but could you speak a little bit bigger picture to how you're thinking about fraud in the card space as well as in the debit space?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So we have replaced 2 million debit cards or will have I think by the end of this week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Credit and debit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Credit and debit. To protect our employees, to protect our customers, et cetera. So I think that look, unfortunately, this cyber security stuff we've now pointed out for a year is a big deal, it's not going to go away, and all of us have a common interest in being protected so this might be a chance for retailers and banks to for once work together as opposed to sue each other like we've been doing the last decade, and but it's in all of our interest to do it.
And I think all people involved in this know that the third parties with its machines, regional machines, your mainframes, you really have to put an extreme effort into protect yourself so this story is not over, unfortunately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right, and there's been this debate between tokenization versus chip and pin, and I'm just wondering do you guys have an angle as to which way you would prefer to see it go?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, honestly I think you'll see both. I think you'll see chip and pin in all cards and then a lot of online type of transactions in tokenization. They both have very, very good technologies to protect consumers and companies from fraud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then just last question, on the Visa, did I hear you correctly, Marianne that you basically realized one-third of the economic value in the Visa shares that you have, is that correct?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, that's correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, so two-thirds left and when you say economic you're talking about net of any hedging?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    There's an unrealized gain approximately of like $3 billion today. It's on our books of zero. This goes back to when Visa was spun off many, many years ago.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But that's right, Betsy, net of hedging.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Betsy Graseck,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right, okay, thanks.

    Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, Glenn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First question on FICC in the IB. It's pretty stable, of course. As a matter of fact, if you look for the year it was about in line with last year which I think once everybody's done reporting will be a pretty good victory, so I guess the question is there's a bunch of structural headwinds blowing on the business and as you do your budgeting it's probably done already. Can the industry grow with the headwinds on it? In other words, the offset would be better activity levels, steeper curves, things like that, but there's a bunch of structural headwinds, I'm just curious how you think of that at the high level?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I guess look, there are some structural headwinds and you've seen a lot of adjustment in the marketplace, people reduce the size of their inventory, and what you don't know going forward is what's going to happen to spreads. But I look at it a little bit like there's a secular and a cyclical. There will be headwinds from regulations et cetera. But over time, assets that people need to manage and buy and sell is going to go up over time, not go down. So what happens in 2014 is hard to say, our business is plenty diversified between rates, credit, emerging markets, FX, commodities, et cetera.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Certainly helping out stability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Which is definitely helping out stability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I see that in the numbers. Maybe on a related note, I got a sense with the renewed focus on SLR that there's a renewed attention to compression trades, and I'm just curious if that's ongoing and it could be material in 2014, as this goes on I know there's a lot of work involved, but the reward is pretty good too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would say Glenn it's ongoing and it will be beneficial. I think material might be a stretch at this point, but and it is a lot of work as you say, so there's a whole industry working on that and us too we expect to be beneficial but not a game changer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So the SLR at 5% we do not think is going to be an issue for us. We barely begun to manage it, there are a lot of things you can do in how you change your business. The bank issue is a little bit different but think of that as more structural. What you did in the bank over the last 20 years and what we're not going to do in the bank going forward, that will take a little bit longer, but not because -- the reasons is it takes longer to change our business models to accommodate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I also think if you look at the other things I mentioned in terms of opportunity for putting NIM to one side, our estimate of the new Basel rules that we had we've given you a 10 basis point movement backwards has a conservative estimate of what we could ultimately achieve over time in terms of the ability to net cash collateral for derivatives just given certain of the conditions. But again over time that will also be manageable like compression trades and like many of those other things.
So we haven't changed our view, we can manage against these targets by doing it thoughtfully and methodically and not having to race through it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay last one for me. You've noted your 9.5% Basel III Tier 1 common, the 10% year-end target seems completely achievable given your earnings. I'm just curious how you think about balancing the absolute versus the relative, meaning you can get there on an absolute basis no problem. On a relative basis, some other large financial institutions have a little bit more. Just curious if that matters as you think about the capital planning process, or is it when you have enough it's enough?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well we've said already that we would be willing to run between 10% to 10.5% so we're on a journey here. We think we can get 10% plus or minus at the end of the year. It could be plus and it could be minus but we think at this point based on what we know that running at that level of buffer of margins should be enough. Obviously we'll be more informed as we go through CCAR processes, but that's our point of view at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glenn Schorr,  ISI Group - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you.

    Our next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi. One more quick follow-up on the net interest margin outlook, Marianne. The NIM expected to be flattish but I wasn't clear if in the current rate environment you expect it to continue to add investments as you have been doing, and would you expect the net interest income dollars to grow from here as they did slightly this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so we have been adding, I mean I talked about the second half of the year gross adding $66 billion. We've never talked about second quarter, we added quite a lot in the second quarter, and yes we have plans to continue to do that in 2014, and yes, we expect our NII dollars to be relatively stable, possibly slightly up over the course of the top of the year, but relatively stable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But not in a lot of investments. Look at the balance sheet today. We have almost $350 billion at central banks, most of it's Fed. Another $350 billion of very high quality investment securities, and those two things combined equal our loans of $700 billion. So the Company's very, very liquid. We don't really need to invest more, but it depends on how much we grow deposits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What about just taking advantage of the 10 year yields moving up and your overall sensitivity to higher rates?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well I already said what we're going to do is what you should assume now is implied yield curves and constant reinvestment, but if you had rates move up 100 basis points all at once, we would probably be much more aggressive doing something like that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then in terms of the litigation reserves, you resolved a number of large issues in the fourth quarter, so two questions here. Can you help us think about how the litigation provision expense might trend in 2014, should we expect it to be lower than the $800 million? And then second, can you tell us if your range of possible loss has come down from the $6.8 billion that it stood at in October since you resolved a few big items?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So obviously, you're going to understand that the necessary caveat that we can't predict for you, the patent and the amount of legal expenses in any one quarter over several quarters; however it would be fair to say that we would certainly hope that for the full year, the full-year cost isn't the first quarter annualized, but we can't be certain of that.
And with respect to reasonably possible loss range, it did come down from $5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter to $5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter given the legal expense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thanks. And then last thing is you mentioned a little bit but can you just give us kind of the philosophy with which you approach this year's CCAR and how you're thinking about balancing your capital achievement goals on the ratios that you talked about with the goal of returning some capital to shareholders?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so I mean, if you think about -- and you can do -- we've done about as much as you can do based on analyst estimates, but if you think about we want to get to 10% plus or minus by the end of next year all else other things being equal, that is a priority, but it is not the only priority. And so as we think about our capital plan, we've consistently said obviously it's a Board decision ultimately and they'll contemplate them in the natural course. But we would like to have the flexibility to be able to potentially increase dividends and also have flexibility to get to do reasonable repurchases, it wouldn't be unreasonable for you to think about how we thought about this year as being relatively consistent with last.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John McDonald,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you.

    Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning. Just a question on the announcement of the potential for selling the prepaid card business. I'm just curious as to what drove that given that it doesn't appear that it was a scale related decision given the size of that business relative to peers, but if you could just provide a little more color as to what you're seeing in that business and what caused you to potentially sell that business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So every year, we try to have a disciplined approach about what we stay in and what we don't, and I think we probably were more disciplined this year about the things we don't need, both from derisking, capital, management focus, controls, et cetera.
If you look at the prepaid card business we are not dealing directly with customers, it's kind of secondary, it's a complex business and we were just better off letting someone else do it. It won't affect the four main franchises that Marianne spoke about that are doing so well. It's just kind of a product we used to do so we're not going to do it anymore. There's a lot of risk associated with it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Right, okay. And then just moving on to your comments about being potentially cautiously optimistic about back-end growth for loans, I presume that's mostly focused on commercial lending. Is it still your view that the canary in the coal mine foreseeing that might be slower deposit growth or in fact negative deposit growth before you start to see loan growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So we didn't use the word cautiously optimistic. We're using the word optimistic because we are actually optimistic, and if you have a US economy starting to grow you will see loan growth and volume growth and of course all these businesses, we are actually optimistic about the US economy in particular.
We spend a lot of time analyzing what rising rates, growth, change of QE3 taper will do to deposits, so it might actually have a diminishing effect on the growth of deposits, but we're happy with it, we're still growing share. I'm not sure you're going to see deposits go negative before you seen loan growth. I think you're trying to fine tune it too closely there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fair enough. And then just finally in terms of your outlook for card balances, it looks like just trying to take some of the fourth-quarter seasonality out of that business that they have sort of bottomed in terms of the overall balances. Are you equally optimistic for those balances to begin to grow in 2014 or are you still looking at sort of flattish balances through most of 2014?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so remember that in our card business we have both dynamics of core growth as well as still some continued run-off. We did reach the inflection point during the second half of 2013 where that run-off was no longer exceeding growth, and so we're set to grow but very modestly in 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But more importantly, 93% of the business awards, we've had 10% growth in spend, we've had was it 14% growth in merchant processing, so we are very happy with the card business. It performed exceptionally well, excellent credit trends so outstanding growth is less important but obviously we like to see some of that too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then just finally for me, are you seeing given some of the security breaches not only in your cards but across a couple of other issuers, have you seen any reduction in consumer spending potentially related to that via cards moving to other forms of purchases or is that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No? Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just a little bit relating to Target but not in general.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Burnell,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A lot of the card growth is coming from T&E and travel and restaurants and things like that.

    Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt of Evercore Partners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning guys. Regarding expenses, can you remind us where we stand on the headcount reductions through I guess 2013 and then where you stand in terms of on track for 2014?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so just to remind you what we said back in February or last year, in the consumer businesses we talked about over the two years, so 2013 and 2014, mortgage seeing headcount reductions of 13,000 to 15,000, and the consumer business predominantly in the branches of 4,000. By the end of 2013, we had seen a 16,500 in total, so in the consumer bank we are actually not only accelerated but outperforming our expectations in terms of our ability to run those branches efficiently and still maintain very strong customer satisfaction and retention rates.
And then in the mortgage base, we have seen total headcount down 11% year over year against that 13,000 to 15,000 two-year target. So obviously we continue to work on the strategy and the size and our approach to mortgage market, but they're obviously relative to those numbers, there's still a little way to go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And remember sorry, remember that that was both production and servicing. What you saw given the rate environment in the middle of second half of 2013 is that some of the production-related headcount reductions were accelerated. We still have meaningful improvement expected in terms of delinquencies and foreclosures and modifications that will continue to drive cost and headcount down in 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it, thank you. And then in terms of the retail branch banking discussion that you had mentioned that you're kind of comfortable with the 5,600 branches level that you're at now, and your focus on optimization going forward, does that imply that you could see additional headcount reductions or shrinkage of the branch network or square footage as we've seen from others? How should we think about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I would think about -- talking about the number of branches I would think about the fact that it all goes to retail distribution, houses will continue to do consolidations and relocations as it makes sense for us to do that in our footprint, and we'll continue to respond to customer preferences, which will mean that over the course of the next decade we'll be looking at obviously the size and use of branches as branches come up for renovation and release and things like that. But we're not expecting a material change in the number as a macro matter, so 5,600 plus or minus, and it is going to be based on customer preferences.
As it relates to headcount reductions, we're already aggressively looking at the efficiency in our same-store branches and have been very successful, so we are looking at starting models, physical capabilities, automation, we're on that journey and we continue to be on it, but I don't see that it's going to be a step change relative to our previous expectations. We've already exceeded them, might be some more, but it's not a step change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Marquardt,  Evercore Partners - Analyst    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it, thank you. Then lastly just on credit quality. It feels like obviously still meaningful reserve releases, still largely in consumer. But is there much left to go in terms of cards or commercial, is that kind of inflecting if you will in terms of the degree of credit leverage that may still be there in terms of reserve release? How should we think about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So let's start with commercial and say that it's plus or minus zero at this point, so I think it's going to be strong for long, but that's not really going to be a reserve story for a little while. In the card business, we had been talking about having potentially reached bottom for a period of time.
We haven't yet or it doesn't seem we have, so as you look into 2014, if things do continue to strengthen, it's possible there will be some more releases but not at the levels that you saw in 2013. So in the first couple of quarters, and usually the first quarters are instructive on that point, usually that's when you see a material improvement if there's going to be one in terms of flow rates.
And then on the mortgage space, two things. We have $2.6 billion of NCI reserve left. We've talked before about the fact that we think our more steady run rate number will be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, so there's another $1 billion to $1.5 billion to come in that space over the course of the next year or so potentially, obviously environment allowing.
And then on an NCI --- I'm sorry --- on the purchased credit impaired portfolio, we have $4.2 billion left off the two releases we just took. But remember that it's a life-of-loan portfolio. So something would have to change now, and the environment improve, for us to expect to take more releases. It is possible, but nothing --- we don't expect to be taking releases up to that $4.2 billion.

    Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Last quarter you had some tax benefits. Did you have tax benefits this quarter and can you quantify those?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, we did have some tax benefits this quarter. We had about $300 million after-tax.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Related to a number of items but state and local tax, some reserve releases, not one particular thing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And what was the loan utilization rate for wholesale or commercial loans?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It was just a little over 30%, low 30%s.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So no change?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and you said the number of branches shouldn't change a whole lot. If I recall from Investor Day you had planned on opening a lot of new branches, I thought it was going to be a net increase, so is this a change in your expectations?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so we said I think at Investor Day plus 100, plus or minus in a year, when Gordon spoke earlier in 2013, we've revisited based upon our assessment of cost and preferences and activity and think we've got the footprint where we are happy at 5,600 plus or minus. ---

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Gordon, if you look at that [bab] presentation, Gordon goes extensively through branches, branch size, technology, headcounts, and why.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So if you look at bab and then obviously also at Investor Day we'll go through it more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then the more general question is per your outlook you said that NII should be kind of flat, mortgage a little bit lower, and expenses only about flat or maybe lower from that $60 billion after you eat that extra $1 billion, so it makes a difference how optimistic you are.
If you are not optimist, you might want to cut expenses more, and if you are optimistic, maybe you assume that fees are going to grow a lot more because I know you want positive operating leverage so how do you see revenues growing faster than expenses? Is it the fees picking up, is it expenses going lower or how do you get there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it's a bit of both. Just one thing on mortgage. Just a tiny clarification.
We expect Mortgage deductions to be broadly the same as we've seen in the second half but we would expect to continue to see improvements in the expense base in the servicing business. But having said all of that it's a combination of relatively stable but potentially slightly higher NII.
Yes, strength in fees on the basis of the strong driver growth that we talked about, and then our $60 billion or less of expenses. So we're working through all of the efficiency opportunities across the businesses, including in the retail space to be able to deliver positive operating leverage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And Mike I think the way you get to it is each of our businesses is always trying to drive efficiency while investing. That doesn't change any particular year. It's kind of a non-stop kind of thing and you see those efficiencies because every business has pretty good margins after investing. And sometimes the revenue growth itself is either episodic or the timing isn't exactly the same how you invest, but if you see the drivers, which is deposits, investable assets, asset management, number of corporate clients, market shares, they are all pretty positive so we're not going to --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you just give us a general sense of your outlook for CIB? In the past you've given us a little bit more detailed future expectations. I mean how do you think 2014 is going to be for capital markets? What's your backlog like right now, and why do you lower VaR if you're more optimistic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [121]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well VaR itself is a calculation that's based upon a whole bunch of different things. We don't deliberately lower VaR.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With VaR, Mike it really is just a feature of two things. If you look at our look back at VaR, across asset classes we're at very low levels of volatility, just across all of the asset classes, and that's actually driving it. If volatility picks up, that could pick up, we're not driving that down, and it's also derisking an SEP, that is a little bit proactive but it's obviously mostly done now, so then on CIB --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Actually we did a number, if you would stay with the volatility that was 18 months ago, VaR itself would be like $60 million or $70 million just all on its own so without changing your position et cetera.
So Mike, the hardest business to get a handle on is CIB, when you talk about the short run, but what we see is investors still have to buy social securities, corporations have ECM and DCM, and you could predict the rolloff et cetera. The backlogs are pretty good. You saw a tremendous amount of IPOs in 2013.
You saw a lot of debt financings, you've already seen a bunch of M&A earlier this year, so we don't budget or plan that you're going to have an unbelievable year in CIB, but if you ask me, the long-term prospects are good. It's probably the business that has to go through the most adjustments in the new regulatory environment, but the long-term prospects are pretty good, so our margins are good, our returns are good.
You see our comp levels of 30%, down from 38% a couple years ago, really reflecting higher capital et cetera. But at that comp level we can pay our people well, grow the franchise all around the world, serve our clients, and still get decent returns. So we feel very good about the business and one of these days it's going to boom, and it's not going to boom because we, you can get just like I can guess when that might happen but it will happen one day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [124]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then lastly, as it relates to Volcker, you said it should not hurt the results materially going ahead in the past, you said it might hurt $1 billion, and then another time you said it might even help. I know that was different Management at the head then, but now you don't think it should impact things too much?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Volcker, all things equal we would say not much. I think when we referred to the $1 billion or $2 billion, we were talking about regulations in general, including derivatives, SAS, clearing houses, and Volcker, and that number we still kind of have in the back of our mind but it's hard to tell what the effect of all those things are. The $1 billion or $2 billion I would say was probably in the conservative category.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [126]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And how much of that would be reflected already?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [127]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's the one that's hard to tell. I would guess--

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [128]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so it's very difficult to back test because these things are all interrelated so it's not entirely possible to disentangle everything, but obviously we've gone through the changes in 2013, some of that will be reflected, but this is a number that we would expect to be reflected to the degree that it is all over the course of the next two years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [129]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Remember some of those things reduce capital requirements, some people are making dramatic changes in their business models which may free up market share for those of us that have additional market share, so it all remains to be seen. And that was also a static analysis. Some certain things we may reprice a little bit because of the capital liquidity requirements around them, so it all remains to be seen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Mayo,  Credit Agricole Securities - Analyst    [130]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alright, thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you, Mike.

    Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [133]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, just had two quick follow-up questions. The first is on the expectations for the expense base and CCB. If you take out that $400 million in legal expenses you're looking at a run rate of $6.9 billion. If you think about what the tailwinds could be for expenses for this year, is it fair to assume that that $6.9 billion quarterly run rate can improve throughout the year this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [134]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I would just reiterate what we previously said, which is if you look at Servicing and in particular, the quarterly run rate, which call it $600 million in line with our expectation that's going to continue to trend down towards $500 million by the end of the year in 2014.
And then on the production side while we obviously are going to see our expenses to a degree of variable with the size of the market, we're continuing to also work on opportunities to make the fixed cost base more efficient, so hopefully we'll deliver some of that in 2014 too. And we'll do a more precise job of putting a bow around that for you at Investor Day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [135]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And the quick other follow-up is a follow-up to Guy's question on operational risk capital. You mentioned that there was a 50 basis point haircut due to litigation. Assuming that you're not going to have similar out sized litigation expense going forward, is that 50 basis point something that you can eventually recoup and how long would that take?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [136]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So that's an excellent question. I would say assuming we have no significant losses going forward then we feel like we should be close to our high point, albeit maybe a little bit more in the first half of 2014.
The reality, just two comments on operational risk. The first is unlike market and credit risk, although all of the parameters and the confidence levels are effectively the same, it doesn't naturally recalibrate itself to changes in the business environment, or to your business mix or model, if you structurally reduce risk. It's very backward-looking, and in that sense it differs because it doesn't recalibrate. And so, as a result if you just let the models continue to predict based on historical losses going forward, you would need to be carrying that elevated level of operational risk capital forward for a reasonably long time.
It's a 1 in a 1,000 year horizon, so think about it in terms of 5 or 10 years, not 1 or 2 years. And so for that reason, we are very interested and working very hard with the industry to try and figure out how to better model changes in the business environment, and to both model and defend structural and permanent risk changes in our businesses in order to be able to recoup some of that more quickly. But at this point I would characterize that as work that has not yet been done, that is in progress, and so for the foreseeable futurity will be elevated.

Erika Najarian,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [137]

    Okay, thank you.

    Our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [139]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [140]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, Matt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [141]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If we just add up kind of some of the odds and ends of the businesses that you are getting out of, or the niche products and impact of Volcker, is it still a relatively modest amount in aggregate? I think last quarter, you had said maybe a few hundred million of revenue give-up from the businesses that you are tweaking. And I just want to know if that still holds, and if we overlay Volcker, kind of what the all-in number might be?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [142]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So to put Volcker aside for a second, with respect we didn't update obviously the list, we are going to do that at Investor Day. We talked about that for you. It's more important to think less about revenue, but more on the impact on the bottom line, given some of these businesses they now have been returning hurdle, may have been in the investment phase, and actually not been breaking even.
So I think it's fair to say that if you consider the impact on the bottom line more so than revenues that it's going to be modest, and we will do work to update you on that. But remember, it also is going to do two things, release capital which will be a positive, and also improve the quality of the businesses and the control environment and the complexity which would all be positive too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [143]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and then just separately, as we think about potential legal uncertainly as a risk going forward, are there a couple that you kind of flag out there that are the ones we should be watching most closely for the industry, for you guys whether it's LIBOR or FX? Or feels like you have obviously settled a lot in the mortgage side, a couple other big ones that are specific to you, what should we be watching to make sure that we have a sense of what is going on?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [144]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is the ones that you all mentioned, and we put them in our 10-K.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [145]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it is the ones you mentioned, and as you look at our disclosures in the 10-Q. Every quarter, the items that we think raise themselves to the level of public disclosure are in that document. So look to last quarter and next quarter and you will see, but we shouldn't comment specifically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [146]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And nothing new, if we knew coming out in the 10-K versus the third quarter Q?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [147]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I don't think so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [148]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not this point, but obviously the Ks are a few weeks away.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [149]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew O'Connor,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [150]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [151]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [152]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great, thanks. On that question about the operational risk capital, isn't it kind of double or triple counting against you when you have got like an $8 billion reserve which reduces your capital? And is it fair to say you don't get credit for that $8 billion in your capital base, when you think about that operational risk capital?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [153]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I mean, I think -- if you think about the sort of basis for capital and put aside whether you like the way it works in a modeled environment, your reserves, that is for expected losses and capital to your expected losses. So in theory you shouldn't get explicit credit for them. I think the bigger point for us is, if you look at the sorts of things driving our capital levels to be as elevated as they are, they are things for example, like the PLMBS issues, and also certain of the very large mortgage DOJ and national mortgage settlement and ISR compensation issues.
It's our belief that this Firm is not exposed today or will not be exposed going forward to those levels of risk, at anywhere near that scale going forward. But as I have said, we have no ability at this point to scale those back, and that's what we are very focused on. So it's less really about whether we are getting credit for our reserves, and a little bit more about how we try in the industry to evolve the framework in partnership with the regulators, and defend over time that there are structural risk reductions that mean those risks are no longer present in that scale.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [154]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. So in the short run the fact that you have settled them actually increases the operational risk, but you hope that over the longer term it will decrease it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [155]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [156]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You had made a brief comment about the equities results about the comparable periods being higher. Were there any other reasons that equity raiding results were kind of down as much as they were?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [157]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Not specifically. We did fairly well in cash, but our cash platform is not as mature as some others. So I think we would characterize the performance as good, but coming off of as I said a very strong quarter for equity derivatives in the third quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [158]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Got it. And then any other areas, I mean, Gordon Smith has presented a few times and talked about kind of derisking some of his businesses. Any other areas that we should be looking at for sales?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [159]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So just I'll comment. On Page 15 last quarter, we showed you a bunch of things we're working on. We didn't replace the page, because it has not meaningfully changed. That is not to say that at the margins we don't continue to look at our businesses in terms of sophistication and derisking. So I would say that while there may be things that the margin that we will explore over time, then there is nothing structurally big that you should be aware of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [160]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great. Thanks so much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [161]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And again, we will do some more of that for you at Investor Day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moshe Orenbuch,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [162]

    Thank you.

    Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [164]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned that your utilization rate in the commercial areas in the low 30% range presently, and you also pointed out that you are optimistic about the US economy for this year being stronger, and then the positive impact it will have on loan demand. What do you think the utilization rate could get to by year-end?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [165]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    That's a hard question but -- so Middle Market if you go back -- so I am going to do just Middle Market because that's the one that's kind of at a 30% too. Years ago, you used to average more like 45%.
It looks like to us, that what you have -- is they have a lot more deposits and a lot less utilization. And so obviously, they are going to use some of their own money before they borrow against a revolver or something like that, and one day, you would expect it to go up. We aren't guessing what's going to happen in 2014, but I would say, we will be sitting here one day when you have had a very strong economy it will be 10 points higher.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [166]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good, and then on the commercial Real Estate, as you pointed out you are having real good success in this area. What geographic regions of the country are you seeing the best success, and then second, what product types are you finding are working the best in growing that book?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [167]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well multi-families a big portion of that and you see that in a lot of -- I would say obviously the major cities is pretty much where you would say -- it's hard to answer specifically. I think both multi-family and other real estate loans, it's really the big cities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [168]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You also mentioned that you have about $350 billion on deposit at the Fed. If the Fed decides to eliminate the interest they pay on those deposits to all of the banks, will that change your strategy of keeping that amount up at the Fed?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [169]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure. Change either that, or how you reimburse clients for deposits, and obviously it will go into how you price them on your business. We are not expecting that to happen, but obviously we would do that, and you have other alternatives, so you might invest some of that money elsewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [170]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, and it's also important to point out there is a large portion of that $350 billion are deposits or cash that we would consider to be client non-operational deposit. And as a result, we don't give ourselves any liquidity value for those, so that is why we are putting them overnight in the Fed.

    Okay, I may have missed this, but in the card merchant and services auto business, the non-interest expenses for the fourth quarter jumped up to $2.2 billion from the prior quarters' $1.9 billion. They have been flat for the prior three quarters. Any particular reason why there was a jump like that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [172]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mostly marketing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [173]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it's predominantly marketing, and with respect to marketing it can be lumpy quarter to quarter. So it's not an unexpected number for us, it's just higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [174]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But we have been doing a good job of card acquisition of high quality cards. You see -- I forgot the number, but it's up quite a bit. So we have some good active programs out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [175]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It looks like in the quarter that you bought back about $300 million worth of stock in this quarter, and year-to-date or since the last CCAR, its just over $2.2 billion. If I recall you have an approval for $6 billion. Is it fair to assume you will use the next quarter to fill out the first -- the rest of the $6 billion or is that too optimistic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [176]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Way optimistic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [177]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I think that would be optimistic. Obviously, we will determine the third quarter as we go through it. We will cover employee issuance, but that's certainly our expectation and maybe more, but I don't think you should expect us to catch up from PB.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [178]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And finally -- (Multiple Speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [179]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Remember, we want to meet our own objective of the 9.5% or 10%. And obviously the litigation costs hurt our ability to do that, so we caught up on that. And also the stock price is a lot higher than it was when we talked about trying to aggressively buyback some stock. So we always look at that as a important thing. We don't just buyback stock regardless of price. Not that we can't get that price, but when it was at $33 a share or whatever, that was a extraordinary compelling price.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gerard Cassidy,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [180]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You also gave us a little bit of guidance of what we should expect for this year's CCAR, maybe similar to what you did last year. Should we look at what you're approved for or what you executed in the repurchases is a better guide number since they are quite a bit different?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [181]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Board will decide when the time comes and they look at all of the priorities et cetera.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [182]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would just reiterate what I said before, which is getting to our target ratio is a priority, it is not the only one. We will have to see how things play out in 2014. But if you do the math then you can take your own estimates of what you think we will earn next year. We should be able to also have the opportunity to take it to buy more than just employee issuance, so you are just going have to -- we want that flexibility. That is what we submitted for, and we will obviously manage through each quarter as we see it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [183]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It may depend on what we sell, how much we can mitigate, what the final rules are and stuff, so there is a lot of moving parts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [186]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, good morning. I just have a few housekeeping questions left. I think you mentioned a mark-to-market gain in Asset Management revenues, wondering if you can just quantify that so we can straighten it out for our forecast?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [187]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It's just a little less than $100 million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derek De Vries,  UBS - Analyst    [188]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Perfect. And then on the Investment Bank, on the comp to income ratio, it is clearly at the right end of your guidance. I am just wondering has there been any change in the deferred versus expense this year, and then I guess related do we enter 2014 with a similar amount of awarded not yet expensed?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [189]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. So there is no change -- (Multiple Speakers). There is no real change in how we do anything.

    Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [192]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the loan growth expectations. If we adjust for the typical seasonality associated with the credit card loans, which obviously is high in the fourth quarter, it looks like your core growth rate in loans was something like 60 or 70 basis points sequentially, which would obviously translate into roughly a 2.5% annual growth rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [193]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Are you talking about total loans -- ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [194]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Are you talking about total and core, or are you talking about reported and -- ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [195]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [196]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [197]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I am talking about reported, correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [198]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [199]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. So it just seems that the 2.5% seems like a fairly robust figure, so I wanted to get your view about what the run rate of core loan growth might be?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [200]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So I am going to try to answer the question, and tell me if I don't I'm sorry. But if you look at our actual total loans for the whole Firm year-over-year, our gross reported was 0.6%, so just call it just shy of 1%. But underlying that core loan growth was about 4%. So I think that as we look forward, we expect core growth to continue at or stronger than those levels, and we have reached as you say in card the point where seasonality aside, that inflection point where we should expect net modest growth.
So and as I said, we are going to have to all wait and see how client demand plays out in the small business and Middle Market space. But we are hoping that at the second half of 2014, when the confidence in the economic recovery -- we have confidence but when others join us, that they will actually start to borrow and spend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [201]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So it sounds like continuing along this trajectory with potential strength in the back half of next year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [202]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, that's our hope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [203]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I'm just trying to reconcile that back to the NII dollar expectations which seem fairly flat. But if we are -- if the loan growth continues fairly strong and the expectation is to continue to deploy capital into securities opportunistically, and the CIO portfolio is approaching breakeven, why is the expectation not for a stronger net interest income dollar growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [204]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because we also are seeing -- we talked earlier about the fact we have been seeing and we expect to continue to see some spread compression in loans, that at this point in the near-term -- we didn't talk about the whole year for 2014 but in the near-term, we are expecting the improvement that we would see as a result of higher yields on investment securities et cetera to be offset by or largely offset by the compression in loan growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Wasserstrom,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey - Analyst    [205]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thanks very much.

    Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [207]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, thanks. Just two final follow-ups. Just on the commitment side, as you talked about adjusting the trade book and as we see the commitments continue to come down, how aggressively are you focusing on the commitment side from here, in terms of balancing the long-term growth potential versus the risk weightings and capital build?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [208]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The way to look at that is that, is what drives the Company is serving clients. And so, we don't target just to get rid of commitments or something like that. But obviously, we have asked all of the people in businesses who to start to optimize a little bit commitments, balance sheet, LCR, SLR, Basel III. And so, you probably see a little bit of a squeeze in commitments as they do that, but not at the expense of trying to do a good job for clients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [209]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure, okay. Great, and the one follow-up on just the run-off -- (Multiple Speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [210]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The other thing I should point out is some of those commitments are much more capital or liquidity hogs than others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [211]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [212]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So that is where you can see a little bit more of the squeeze.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [213]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And then one follow-up on the fixed income side, within that comments earlier about the run-off businesses. Is there a way you can update how we should think about the potential sale of physical commodities, and what proportion it is of the $15.5 billion of FIC revenues this year. And to Marianne, to your point about how that is in a relative profitable sense?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [214]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I think if you look back and see that -- I mean, let's talk about this year and last year. If you look at 2013 reported, you would have seen that our commodities revenues counted for in the low teens of our markets revenues, but that's on an accounting basis. When you think about, so that's just a revenue pure only.
If you think about the economic revenue because obviously it's an accounting growth where it is much smaller number than that. So call it mid single digit, mid to 6%, 7%. But then it was a business that was in a combination of being built out so it wasn't fully mature. And also we are selling parts of the business that are highly capital intensive to us. So think about the impact of the bottom line as being considerably more modest and with some capital benefit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Usdin,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [215]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Thanks very much.

    Our next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [217]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, thank you very much. Most of my questions been answered, but I wanted to talk a little bit about your mortgage origination platform. It looks like you dropped from about $40 billion to $23 billion, and your overall market dropped like 25%, and that's like a 40% drop which drops probably your market share below 8%.
Can you add some color to that? Is that mainly a function of the refis going away? Should we see an increase in market share down the road?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [218]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I would -- a couple things. First of all, if you just take the second half versus first half, we said that we thought the overall market was down 30% to 40%. It was down about 33%. So it was in line with our expectations and our performance is in line with that too. So you have got to remember that the revenue versus closed loan volume, and how that gets recognized there is some timing differences.
With respect to market share, if you look backwards into 2013, the overall size of the market was revised up, which means that our market share was -- all else things being equal --just relatively revised down, doesn't change anything. But going forward, our market share will be a factor of obviously the size of the market, but also our pricing discipline to make sure we want to get an appropriate risk adjusted return. So we would gain share but only if we can do it, getting paid for the risk and the cost of servicing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [219]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the whole reduction was refi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [220]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the whole reductions was refi -- yes, I should say that, yes. (Multiple Speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [221]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And now that we have got -- I know you don't want to make any really comments about political figures. But now that we have got that Mel Watt coming to town, that is probably going to be more focused in extending the credit box that we have seen over the last couple of years, where most of the companies don't really want to get away from high FICO, high credit quality product. Do you --what type -- do you think that Watt can be successful in opening the credit curve, and what types of things would you want to hear where you would start extending that credit -- the credit box?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [222]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I would say that people in the business has slowly been extending the credit box, if you look at LTV -- I am talking about over the last 18 months, if you look at LTVs, if you go to different cities, I am not sure you are going to see a dramatic expansion of the credit box, because all of the rep and warranty and litigation and stuff like that, where anything that is not qualified mortgages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [223]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, and for qualified mortgages, credit is available, GSE is 90% LTV, on the Ginnie Mae side closer to 100% LTV, so there is credit availability. You just have to have the ability to pay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [224]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And FHA will set its own policy. But even there I think you'll have a much tighter underwriting than the FHA guidelines, because of how much FHA's cost people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Miller,  FBR & Co. - Analyst    [225]

    Okay, thank you very much.

    Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Wheeler,  Mediobanca - Analyst    [227]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, good morning. I have a couple of questions. The first one, maybe I suppose goes back to Sunday and the news that came out of [Bar]. I mean, I have the last 16 quarters we have been talking about regulation and you have often been quite aggressive in talking about the impact of some of that regulation.
But it seemed like we have reached the tipping point on Sunday, whereby we step back to most rules suggested in June, and came out with something that was sensible, but actually also was going to support the growth of your business, and indeed the growth of the economy. Do you think we are at a stage now where we can feel that we are over the worst of the regulation, and we can actually get on with running our and your businesses?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [228]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think we know for the most part the contours of the regulation at this point, and some of the fine tuning still needs to be done. So you can see a lot of banks globally, adjusting to the new financial architecture, and the effect of that will be different, different parts of the world, slightly different for certain products, but it will probably be okay in total. But it's nice to, I mean --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [229]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Have the rules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [230]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Nice to have the rules and live with them, and now we have to push them down and understand them in a little more detail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [231]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    There is still a few things we are waiting for, I mean, long-term debt requirements, something to look out for in the first quarter, but I mean, having more clarity is definitely helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [232]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You have seen some people make bigger strategic changes, some are making small tactical changes, and then we are going to report a lot more on what we think the effect of all of this in Investor Day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Wheeler,  Mediobanca - Analyst    [233]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, and the second question really relates down to the mix of your Investment Banking revenues. Clearly, what we have seen is obviously the downward on fixed income for some time now for a bunch of these, some of which you have touched on. But I suppose -- what a lot of people are talking about is the fixed income will no longer quite be the dominant parts of the revenue pool for big investment banks as it was. But in your case and one or two other big players, it's obviously very important business. Is your view, and perhaps don't just talk about yourself, but the really big players, the very successful players in fixed income, will actually probably be seeking to take share with what is going to be a smaller part going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [234]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Again, I look a little bit different. I look like -- the pot will change and adjust to new world, but from there will probably grow. Because if you look at underlying numbers, the amount of investable assets around the world is going to double over 10 years, the amount of needs of corporations, i.e -- and sovereigns and super nationals, and ECM, DCM advice will double over 10 years, so there is a -- there will be a strong underlying business. Spreads, products, those things have always changed. Spreads have been coming down my whole life, and yet we have a healthy business -- and so we expect that fixed income after some adjustment will be a good business. We think a lot of these trends are cyclical, not secular and that's how we are positioned for it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [235]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And we have paychecks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [236]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And we have -- (Multiple Speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Wheeler,  Mediobanca - Analyst    [237]

    I wish you luck. Thank you very much. (Multiple Speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [238]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And it is possible that -- if people leave and the things we price it will go back to -- all businesses have to have a normal return on capital for the average player otherwise they wouldn't exist. So we do think you will see some of that. There will be pieces that go to non-banks which is fine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Wheeler,  Mediobanca - Analyst    [239]

    Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [241]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hello, good morning. I had a couple questions regarding the Basel SLR. Specifically I wanted to clarify a comment where you made earlier where it sounds as though you expect the US regulators to adopt the revised Basel framework from over the weekend as a final SLR calculation approach. And I didn't know if that guidance was in the context of the higher 5% SLR requirement, which is being imposed on the US G-SIBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [242]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Look, I think the reality is I don't know anymore than you do. I just that think given the changes that were made, it seemed to be positive and constructive as reason to believe that the US regulators would want to leverage that. I could be wrong, and I am not aware of -- obviously, we did comment letters on the US MPR, but I am not aware of any specifics on the portion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [243]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So I would just add, if you listen to what regulators said, not this time, but going back they intended to make Basel and US rules common about the rules. They did not say they intended to have the same percent. So we are just assuming the 5% is going to stay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [244]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jamie Dimon,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - Chairman and CEO    [245]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And we think there will be a couple other adjustments going forward too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [246]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, no, that's helpful. And then just looking at both the risk base and leverage based ratios, it sounds as though for the SLR, there are a lot of mitigation opportunities at your disposal. On a pro forma basis, which ratio do you anticipate will represent the binding constrain on capital return going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [247]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So if you look at the total Firm consolidated, then they actually come out quite nicely. If you think about our target for [Tier 1] common at 10% to 10.5% and a leverage target of 5% to 5.5%. So I think the leverage ratio feels like as a consolidated matter, it is a simple backstop exactly as it is supposed to be and not a binding constraint. The devil is in the detail as you push that down, as I have said for the individual business and products. And then, obviously consider it in the context of the whole client relationship. I think as we look forward, CCAR is something to just be thoughtful about. Because it's a stressed scenario. It is evolving in terms of the maturity, as well as a move over time towards being on a Basel III advanced approach. So if I had to guess I would say CCAR could be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Chubak,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [248]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you. And then transitioning to a risk-based ratio that is maybe I guess not spoken about as often, the Tier 1 capital ratio, that ultimately could compel increased preferred issuance. We did see capital market within the first six months of the year, and I didn't know how we should be thinking about the level of preferred issuance you are targeting going forward. Is it consisting with the 150 basis points noted within the Fed's proposal, or should we be thinking about that differently, i.e. some of the mandated buffer will be met with incremental equity?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marianne Lake,  JPMorgan Chase & Co - CFO    [249]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I would say -- so I would say that our Tier 1 capital needs to be at 11%-plus. We said we are going to run it at 10% to 10.5% above [Tier 1] common. I would suggest the gap will be prepped and maybe more. Maybe more prepped than that.

In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies 
may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety 
of items. Such forward-looking statements are based upon current 
expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ 
materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a 
number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically 
identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies 
may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or 
incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results 
contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT TRANSCRIPTS IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION
OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO
PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS,
OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS.
IN NO WAY DOES THOMSON REUTERS OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER
DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN
ANY EVENT TRANSCRIPT. USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S
CONFERENCE CALL ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE
MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.
