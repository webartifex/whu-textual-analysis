1;7;38;19;2;0.105263157894737;we said it was driven by derivatives. cash out of prime brokerage did better. prim did better than cash.;;;;;
1;13;4;19;2;0.105263157894737;north america will be a tough comp. it was very strong in 2015, but europe could be very constructive.;;;;;
2;18;14;11;1;0.0909090909090909;you should be able to extrapolate those numbers on your own.;;;;;
3;60;2;78;7;0.0897435897435897;david, we do not expect to see any deterioration in the progress that we've been making throughout the year. so again, i think we entered the fourth quarter highly confident and in a very strong position with our stores performing incredibly well, great merchandise, a terrific marketing campaign, great digital capabilities and an expanded suite of digital fulfillment capabilities. so we feel very good about how the entire business is set to perform in the fourth quarter.;;;;;
4;10;11;45;4;0.0888888888888889;not specifically, no. i will tell you that while we are obviously delighted with the performance it was a relatively strong market and there were some larger transactions so we're happy with the gains. i can not specifically comment on where it came from.;;;;;
5;16;6;26;2;0.0769230769230769;yes, it's a very competitive business and it's very profitable. so all other things being equal, we would like to continue to gain share.;;;;;
6;20;33;98;7;0.0714285714285714;yes. so look, our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong. so when we say moderated, it's from very strong to very strong. and it is in part due to the number of new products we've had. so we would continue -- the sapphire reserve card spend engagement is very strong, and we're very pleased with it. so it's not -- i would not say it's a moderation necessarily. it's just, at these very high levels, from a slightly higher to very strong is still a great story.;;;;;
7;6;8;75;5;0.0666666666666667;yes, i would say it's fair to assume that our core margin should be relatively stable throughout the year, and i think plus or minus 2 basis points on a large balance sheet like ours with mix changes is relatively stable. so our expectation is for core nim to be relatively stable in 2014, to be stable to slightly positive in 2015, assuming that the implied rate curve plays out the way it is.;;;;;
8;42;21;91;6;0.0659340659340659;we feel good about where we are. we've been working on this for a long time and we continue to deploy resources to get better and better at that. so this is just a long-term initiative that we have to continue to focus on, whether it's in food, whether it's demographics, whether it is ethnic groups, we've just got to continue to get better at our localization efforts. we think we've made good progress there and we are going to continue to focus on it.;;;;;
9;31;7;92;6;0.0652173913043478;absolutely. the strategy is very consistent, and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to make the levers work. because our brands are strong and we're investing in them, and because our bottling system is executing very well and we continue to get better. i think one of the mantras in our team, dara, is that we've got the right strategy. but we're just beginning to hit our stride from a capability standpoint, and we have much more opportunity to improve than we have progress made so far.;;;;;
10;20;34;47;3;0.0638297872340425;so if you think about -- our first acquisitions were in august and september. so we're kind of at the early stages. so far, very encouraging. so far, better than our expectations. but a little early to sort of draw firm conclusions on it, but very encouraging.;;;;;
